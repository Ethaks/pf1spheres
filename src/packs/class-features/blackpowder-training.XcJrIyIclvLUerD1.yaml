      <p>At 1st level, the conscript gains the Firearm Proficiency Equipment
      sphere talent as a bonus talent.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the conscript gains the gunslinger&#8217;s grit class
      feature, using his practitioner modifier in place of Wisdom for his grit
      pool and to determine the effects of deeds. If the conscript would gain
      another grit, panache, or other similar pool from other conscript
      specializations, they stack. The conscript gains the following gunslinger
      deeds: gunslinger initiative, quick clear, and utility shot. In addition,
      the conscript may spend 1 grit point as a free action whenever he damages
      an opponent with a melee attack action using his firearm, such as with the
      Gun Kata or Archery Bash talents. If he does, the conscript can make a
      trip combat maneuver against that opponent as a free action.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, while the conscript has at least 1 grit point, the
      conscript deals additional damage with firearms, adding half his
      practitioner modifier (minimum 1) on damage rolls when firing a
      firearm.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the conscript gains the following gunslinger deeds:
      expert loading, menacing shot, and startling shot.</p>
