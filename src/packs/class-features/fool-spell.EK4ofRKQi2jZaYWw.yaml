    value: >
      <p>Whenever the troubadour succeeds at a saving throw against
      mind-affecting magic that exerts control over the troubadour (such as
      charm person, dominate person, or similar effects), he can so thoroughly
      pretend that it has affected him that he can even fool the magic itself.
      To the caster, it appears that the troubadour failed his saving throw, but
      the troubadour is not under the caster&#8217;s control. If the spell
      provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but the troubadour is
      under no obligation to follow the caster&#8217;s commands. The troubadour
      can always dismiss the fooled magic as a standard action. Fool spell can
      be used when the troubadour succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against
      an ongoing effect. The troubadour must be at least 4th level to gain this
      actor training.</p>
