      <p>A troubadour is an expert actor, who not only can appear to become
      someone different, but with practice and dedication can begin to think and
      act like them as well. For all intents and purposes, when the troubadour
      adapts a persona, he becomes another person entirely. A troubadour can
      only adopt one persona at a time.</p>

      <p>Along with his true self (his &#8216;base persona&#8217;, which may
      never be changed), the troubadour begins play with two additional personas
      of his own creation. These alternate personas can have the same
      characteristics as his base persona, but may also have a different name, a
      different appearance, a different alignment (but only within 1 step of the
      troubadour&#8217;s true alignment), and may even be of a different race
      (although the troubadour does not gain that race&#8217;s size, racial
      abilities, etc.). These changes can qualify the troubadour for feats and
      other abilities that would normally be outside his ability to gain, but
      for the purpose of all feats, talents, and abilities, the troubadour only
      gains the benefits while in a persona that meets all the
      prerequisites.</p>

      <p>A troubadour gains an additional persona for every 5 troubadour levels
      he possesses, and gains these personas instantly when he gains the
      appropriate level, as it is assumed he has been working on these new
      personalities in his spare time during his adventures.</p>

      <p>Although a persona may possess any number of traits, adopting a persona
      is not the same as appearing as that persona. If a persona possesses the
      same race and appearance as the troubadour, no disguise is required
      (however, any creature familiar with two or more personas with the same
      face will immediately recognize they are the same person). However, the
      troubadour may choose to mix a persona with a disguise, allowing the
      persona to appear as a completely different person. In this case, a
      Disguise check is required, but only when the troubadour encounters people
      familiar with two or more of his personas, when the troubadour suffers a
      penalty to his Disguise check (for example, when the troubadour is
      attempting to pass himself off as a different race, size, or gender) or in
      other situations where the troubadour is attempting to derive a specific
      benefit from his disguise or otherwise hide his true identity (for
      example, when using an orc persona to gain access to an orc
      stronghold).</p>

      <p>It takes 10 minutes for a troubadour to prepare a persona, during which
      time the troubadour usually applies makeup and costume, recites lines, or
      performs other mental exercises to shift themselves into the character.
      This change is as much mental as physical, and while the troubadour can
      don a Disguise as part of this change, items that apply quick disguises
      (such as a hat of disguise) do not reduce this required time. A troubadour
      can change his prepared persona at any time, provided he can spend 10
      minutes preparing the new persona. Once a persona has been prepared, the
      troubadour can switch between his base persona and his prepared persona as
      a free action, usable once per round. Switching to his base persona does
      not remove any disguise, but breaking character in any way (reverting to a
      base persona or switching to a different persona without changing
      appearance) immediately reveals the truth about the troubadour&#8217;s
      multiple personas (although with GM permission, some fast Disguise and
      Bluff checks might manage to hide the truth).</p>

      <p>It is possible for a troubadour to permanently change one of his
      personas into a completely different persona, but doing so requires 5 days
      of work. This follows the rules for creating a magic item (8 hours of work
      per day, this work may be divided up over multiple days, and development
      may be done while traveling on foot or mounts, but doing so reduces the
      amount of time that may be dedicated per day in half (4 hours), and such
      work on the move is only half as effective (netting only 2 hours of
      development)).</p>

      <p>While working to create a new persona, the troubadour must choose an
      old persona for it to replace, other than his base persona. This persona
      is removed from the troubadour&#8217;s list of personas at the time he
      begins work on the new persona. The troubadour may cease work on one
      persona to begin creating a different persona, but all work on the
      previous persona is lost when the change is made. If the troubadour is
      attempting to recreate a persona he used in the past (same name, same
      alignment, same abilities as far as were available at the level it was
      last used), development takes half the usual time.</p>

      <p>Although a troubadour does not need to hide his true face to adopt a
      persona, if the people the troubadour is interacting with are not aware
      that the troubadour possesses other personas, he gains a number of special
      benefits.</p>

      <p>So long as knowledge about his multiple personas is unknown, Knowledge
      checks about one of the troubadour&#8217;s personas do not reveal
      information about the other personas.</p>

      <p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the troubadour only work if
      the troubadour is currently in the persona the creature is attempting to
      locate (or if the creature knows that the two personas are the same
      individual). Otherwise, the spell or ability has no effect, revealing
      nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>

      <p>Beyond these, there may be other benefits, as determined by the GM. For
      example, so long as two personas are not connected to the same individual,
      criminal activity and other actions taken by one persona do not affect the
      social standing of the other personas.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> If the troubadour possesses the dual identity class
      feature (such as from vigilante class levels), he may choose to make his
      vigilante identity a persona, gaining the benefits of the method acting
      class feature while in his vigilante identity. The troubadour uses the
      lesser time required when changing into a vigilante persona.</p>
