    value: >
      <p>When the armorist summons a ranged weapon or calls a bound ranged
      weapon, she may summon non-basic ammunition. If it is a firearm it can be
      summoned with paper alchemical cartridges. Additionally, the armorist may
      summon up to 10 gp per armorist level of specialist ammunition; this
      ammunition replaces pieces of normal ammunition such that the summoned
      amount is still 50.</p>

      <p>This arsenal trick can be taken twice. If taken a second time, increase
      the value of summoned non-basic ammunition to 25 gp per armorist
      level.</p>
