      <p><strong>Weatherworn (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter can treat
      the effects of any weather as being 1 step lesser in severity for himself.
      This improves to 2 steps at 12th level, and 3 steps at 20th level.</p>

      <p><strong>Cyclone:</strong> At 8th level, the incanter can create a
      vortex of turbulent wind around himself as a standard action. This vortex
      has a radius of up to 10 feet and a maximum height of 10 feet per incanter
      level. Any ranged attack passing through this vortex automatically misses.
      Any flying creature moving through the vortex must make a Fly skill check
      or immediately fall from the sky, taking falling damage (the creature
      cannot make a Fly check to reduce or negate this damage). Creatures on the
      ground cannot pass through the vortex without first making a Strength
      check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the incanter&#8217;s MSB. The
      vortex is faintly visible and can be spotted with a DC 15 Perception skill
      check. Maintaining this ability is a free action and the incanter can use
      this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his incanter level.
      These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p><strong>Cloak of the Elements (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the
      incanter is protected from weather and elements, taking only half damage
      from all sources of acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage.</p>
