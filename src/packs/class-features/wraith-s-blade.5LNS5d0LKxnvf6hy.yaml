      <p>The wraith may spend a spell point as a swift action to cause all his
      attacks to become incorporeal touch attacks (and thus be resolved as touch
      attacks, though effects that apply against incorporeal touch attacks
      function normally) until the end of his turn. This ability also allows the
      attacks to be made against corporeal targets while wraith form is
      active.</p>

      <h2 id="toc39"><span>Greater Possession</span></h2>

      <p>At 10th level, when the wraith succeeds in actively possessing a
      target, he may choose to maintain control of that target while moving on
      to another. The wraith may choose to exit the creature, appearing in an
      adjacent square or the nearest available square. The wraith may act
      normally, dividing his actions between the actively possessed creature and
      himself. Multiple creatures may be actively possessed; actions are divided
      between all possessed creatures and the wraith. For example, if the wraith
      possesses an orc, the wraith may spend his next standard action to possess
      the nearby goblin, then move the orc up to its speed (a move action), and
      cast a quickened sphere effect (a swift action). The following round, the
      goblin could reload a light crossbow (a move action), the orc could make
      an attack action (a standard action), and the wraith would still have a
      swift action. The number of creatures possessed at one time may not exceed
      the wraith&#8217;s casting ability modifier (minimum 2). The wraith may
      choose to end his control of any possessed creature as a free action.</p>

      <h2 id="toc40"><span>Wraith Form Mastery</span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level, the wraith may remain in wraith form for any number of
      rounds in a day. Any instances of the extra wraith form and lingering
      incorporeality wraith haunts may immediately be retrained for other wraith
      haunts for which the wraith qualifies.</p>
