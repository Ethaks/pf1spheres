      <p><strong>Telekinetic Impediment (Sp):</strong> At 3rd level, the
      incanter may spend an immediate action to attempt to impede an attack made
      against a creature within 30 feet of him, including himself. He must
      declare he is using this ability before the attack roll is made. The
      attack suffers a -1 penalty, -1 per 5 incanter levels he possesses. He may
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his casting
      ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Great Flight (Su):</strong> Starting at 8th level, as a free
      action the incanter may grant himself a fly speed of 50 feet with perfect
      maneuverability for a number of minutes per day equal to his incanter
      level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used
      in 1 minute increments.</p>

      <p><strong>Telekinetic Stability (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the
      incanter gains a circumstance bonus equal to his incanter level to Fly
      checks, Acrobatics checks, and his CMD.</p>
