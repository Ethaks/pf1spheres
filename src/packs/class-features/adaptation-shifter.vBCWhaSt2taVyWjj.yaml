      <p>The shifter suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment and
      can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit
      (-45 and 60 degrees Celsius) without having to attempt Fortitude saves.
      Her equipment is likewise protected. This trait does not provide any
      protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other
      environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.</p>

      <p>If she possesses the flight bestial trait, she also is acclimated to
      living at high altitudes and treats her altitude zone as if it were one
      lower. At shifter level 10, she may treat it as two levels lower.</p>

      <p>If she possesses the home in water bestial trait, she also is immune to
      the pressures of the ocean and takes no damage from water pressure.</p>
