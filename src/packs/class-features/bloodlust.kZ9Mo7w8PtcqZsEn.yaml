      <p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to increase
      her damage dealt to creatures depending on how many times she has hit
      them. For 1 round per level, whenever she successfully strikes an opponent
      with a weapon or natural attack, she gains a cumulative +1 bonus on future
      damage rolls, to a maximum equal to her class level. If she misses with an
      attack, the bonus to damage decreases by 1 (minimum 0).</p>
