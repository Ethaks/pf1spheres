      <p>Lodestone&#8217;s unusual properties often seem like magic to the
      uninitiated, but to the scholar, it is a predictable and reliable tool.
      The scholar may activate this imposition in one of two ways: firstly, the
      scholar may draw one primarily metal item or creature within 60 ft. + 10
      ft. per class level directly towards herself. This item or creature cannot
      weigh more than 50 lbs. per class level the scholar possesses, and if it
      is a living creature or an item held by a living creature, the scholar
      must succeed on a combat maneuver check against the opponent&#8217;s CMD,
      using her class level in place of her base attack bonus and her
      Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier for the check.
      Upon a successful use of this ability, the targeted creature or item is
      moved up to 10 ft. per class level directly towards the scholar; if this
      ability is used on a creature, this movement provokes attacks of
      opportunity.</p>

      <p>Secondly, the scholar may use this ability to repel all metal creatures
      or objects within a 30 ft. radius; this ability cannot effect a single
      item or creature whose weight is more than 50 lbs. per class level the
      scholar possesses. Any unattended metal objects within the radius of this
      effect are immediately moved directly away from the scholar to the first
      legal square outside of the effect&#8217;s radius; when the scholar
      activates this ability, she makes a single combat maneuver check using her
      class level in place of her base attack bonus and her Intelligence
      modifier in place of her Strength modifier and compares the result against
      the CMD of all metal creatures or creatures wielding metal equipment
      within the area&#8217;s effect, moving any creature whose CMD her check
      exceeds directly away to the first legal square outside of the
      effect&#8217;s radius. Creatures wielding metal weapons may choose to drop
      them rather than be subject to this ability&#8217;s effects, but creatures
      wearing metal armor are treated as metal creatures for determining this
      ability&#8217;s effects.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Magnetic Bursts [explosive]:</strong> Scholars with the
      lodestone material imposition may enhance their flashbangs with lodestone
      flakes that cling to the target, making it easier for metallic weapons, or
      weapons whose primary damage- dealing apparatus is composed of metal, such
      as spear or arrowheads, to hit the target. For the next 1d4 rounds, any
      attack made with a metal weapon against a target who has failed their save
      against a flashbang modified with this explosive gains a +1 circumstance
      bonus to the attack roll, +1 for every 3 class levels the scholar
      possesses.</li>
