      <p>As a swift action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to charge a
      weapon she is holding with magical energy for a number of minutes equal to
      her casting ability modifier. While the weapon is charged, the mageknight
      may add her casting ability modifier instead of her Dexterity or Strength
      modifier to attack rolls and damage rolls with this weapon.</p>

      <p>If the weapon is a melee weapon, she may use the weapon as a thrown
      weapon with an increment of 20 feet. The weapon keeps its own damage and
      critical hit characteristics, and is not considered an improvised
      weapon.</p>

      <p>When an imbued weapon is used as a thrown weapon, the weapon teleports
      back to her hand at the end of her turn, or the beginning of her next turn
      if used outside her turn. When an imbued weapon is a ranged weapon, then
      making ranged attacks with the weapon does not draw attacks of
      opportunity.</p>
