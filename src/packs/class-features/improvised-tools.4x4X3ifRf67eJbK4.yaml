      <p>By expending one use of his gadgets, the technician can make any skill
      check that requires having tools and requires less than 1 hour to make as
      if he possessed the necessary tools. The technician does not suffer the
      usual penalties for using improvised tools. If the technician already
      possesses the necessary tools, the technician can expend a gadget to treat
      those tools as masterwork for one skill check. The technician can create
      improvised tools that function as masterwork tools for one skill check,
      but doing so expends 2 gadgets.</p>
