    value: >
      <p>The sage may spend a ki point when making an attack with his ki blast
      to cause it to detonate in a 10 ft. radius burst if it strikes his target.
      The sage rolls damage for the attack once and deals it to all creatures
      within the radius of the effect; creatures other than the primary target
      of the attack may make a Reflex save for half damage. For every 5 class
      levels the sage possesses, the radius of the burst increases by 10 ft.;
      the sage may always choose to have the effect detonate in a smaller burst
      than its maximum, but can only decrease the radius in units of 10
      feet.</p>
