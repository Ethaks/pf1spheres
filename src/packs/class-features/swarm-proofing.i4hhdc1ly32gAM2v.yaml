      <p>The blacksmith sews durable, yet flexible material into the gaps of the
      clothing and armor; all creatures affected by this maintenance gain DR 2/-
      against swarms of any size; at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter the
      DR increases by 2.</p>

      <h2 id="toc14"><span><span style="color: #993300">Thunderous Blows
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>Starting at 1st level, the blacksmith becomes particularly adept at
      striking crafted creations in exactly the right place and manner to damage
      them most effectively. When the blacksmith makes an attack action or
      attack of opportunity, he deals an additional 1d6 damage if making a
      successful sunder attempt or if attacking a construct or object (including
      animated objects). This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every two
      levels thereafter. The blacksmith never provokes attacks of opportunity
      for attempting the sunder combat maneuver, and whenever the blacksmith
      chooses to destroy an item held or worn by a creature with a sunder
      attempt any excess damage is applied to the item&#8217;s wielder. The
      blacksmith counts as having the Improved Sunder feat for determining
      prerequisites.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the blacksmith has learned how to swing his weapons in a
      way that shatters scales and claws as easily as manufactured armor and
      weapons. The blacksmith may make a special sunder attempt as an attack
      action, targeting a creature&#8217;s natural armor or natural weapons. If
      the blacksmith chooses to sunder the creature&#8217;s natural armor, on a
      successful check he deals damage to the creature equal to his normal
      weapon damage (bonus damage from thunderous blows is not applied when
      using sunder in this manner) and it takes a penalty to its natural armor
      bonus equal to the number of bonus damage dice granted by his thunderous
      blows class feature; a creature&#8217;s natural armor bonus cannot be
      reduced below 0 in this manner. Any amount of magical healing removes this
      penalty, as does a DC 15 Heal check, which can be made as a standard
      action.</p>

      <p>If the blacksmith chooses to sunder the creature&#8217;s natural
      weapon, on a successful check he deals damage to the creature equal to his
      normal weapon damage and it takes a penalty to attack rolls with that
      natural weapon equal to the number of bonus damage dice granted by his
      thunderous blows class feature for 1 round.</p>

      <h2 id="toc15"><span><span style="color: #993300">Skilled Craftsman
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>Starting at 2nd level, the blacksmith may use Profession (blacksmith)
      in place of all Craft and Spellcraft skill checks made to create, modify,
      repair, and enchant weapons, armor, and shields, and he gains a competence
      bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Profession
      (blacksmith) checks. In addition, the smith learns to quickly repair
      damaged objects, restoring 2 hit points per class level he possesses to an
      object as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If the
      object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object
      is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of
      an object must be present for this ability to function. Magic items can be
      repaired by this ability, but the blacksmith&#8217;s class level must be
      equal to or higher than the caster level of the object. This ability does
      not affect creatures (including constructs). This ability has no effect on
      objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still
      repair damage done to such items. This ability can be used to repair
      nonmagical weapons, armor, and shields that have been destroyed, as long
      as all the pieces are together in an accessible location. At 5th level,
      the blacksmith no longer provokes an attack of opportunity for using this
      ability.</p>

      <h2 id="toc16"><span><span style="color: #993300">Smithing Insight
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s expertise in crafting and maintaining weapons
      and equipment has given him a broader and deeper insight into the
      strengths and weaknesses of all kinds of equipment. Unless otherwise
      noted, a blacksmith cannot select an individual smithing insight more than
      once. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter the blacksmith gains one
      smithing insight from the following list:</p>
