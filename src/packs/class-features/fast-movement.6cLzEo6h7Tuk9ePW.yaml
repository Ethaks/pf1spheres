    value: >
      <p>At 3rd level, a conscript&#8217;s land speed is faster than the norm
      for his race by +10 ft. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no
      armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply
      this bonus before modifying the conscript&#8217;s speed because of any
      load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to
      the conscript&#8217;s land speed. At 6th level and every five levels
      thereafter, the conscript&#8217;s land speed increases by an additional
      +10 feet.</p>
