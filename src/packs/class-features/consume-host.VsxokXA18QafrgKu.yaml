      <p>While possessing a living creature, the wraith may spend a spell point
      as a move action to deal 1d6 untyped damage per 2 class levels to the
      host. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage. The wraith heals a
      number of hit points equal to the damage dealt. A creature that
      successfully saves against this ability becomes immune to it for the
      duration of the possession.</p>
