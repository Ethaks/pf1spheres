      <p>The hedgewitch can create a poppet that possesses a sympathetic link to
      a creature, allowing her to affect them with her magic regardless of
      distance. To create a poppet, she must personally collect a specimen
      directly from the creature&#8217;s body, such as a hair, a nail cutting,
      or drop of blood. Within 24 hours of collection, she must create a small
      poppet that incorporates the entire specimen, a process that takes 1 full
      minute and requires common materials of negligible cost (such as a handful
      of straw, mud, or wood). The poppet lasts indefinitely once created. When
      she uses a magic sphere ability, she may target the poppet to affect the
      creature it was made from, allowing her to affect them regardless of
      distance or line of sight, though they must be on the same plane. The
      sympathetic link makes the creature immediately aware of the incoming
      effect and allows them to defend against it without being surprised, even
      if asleep, though they are not made aware of the magic&#8217;s precise
      nature or source. After conveying magic 1 + 1 time per 10 hedgewitch
      levels, the poppet crumbles and becomes useless. She may only possess a
      number of poppets equal to her casting ability modifier at one time, and
      only one poppet at a time for any given creature. If she collects a sample
      for a new poppet that would put her over these limits, an older poppet
      crumbles (either the already existing poppet for the creature targeted if
      she has one, or one of her choice if she does not).</p>
