      <p>An eliciter&#8217;s power comes from his command of emotions, both his
      own and others. At 2nd level, an eliciter chooses an emotion, gaining the
      minor power associated with that emotion. At 5th level and every 3 levels
      thereafter, the eliciter may choose to gain the minor power of a new
      emotion, or gain access to the next level of an emotion he already
      possesses (lesser, greater, and master). An eliciter cannot gain a lesser
      power before 5th level, a greater power before 8th level, or a master
      power before 11th level. All emotions are mind-affecting effects. If an
      emotion calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 his eliciter
      level + his Charisma modifier + his persuasive bonus.</p>
