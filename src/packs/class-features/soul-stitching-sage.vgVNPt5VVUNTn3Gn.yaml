      <p>The sage transforms his ki into a tangible needle and thread he can use
      to stitch wounds. As a standard action, the sage can spend 1 ki point to
      heal himself or an adjacent target of an amount of hit point damage equal
      to 3 x his class level. If the sage is at least 5th level, the target is
      also healed of 1 point of ability damage, plus 1 additional point of
      ability damage for every 3 class levels he possesses. This ability can be
      used to reattach severed limbs, as long as the original limb is available,
      removing any effects or penalties attributed with the limbs&#8217;
      loss.</p>
