      <p>With 10 minutes of work, the technician can expend a gadget to create
      quick, artificial structures that last for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>The nature of the structure depends on what materials are available; if
      the technician only has cloth available he can create a cloth structure,
      but if he is in a forest or has access to wood he may build a structure
      out of wood, and if he is in a cave with loose stones or have access to
      stone he could build a structure out of stone. The technician must have
      about 10 square feet of cloth, 50 lbs. of wood, or 100 lbs. of stone to
      create a 5 ft. square of structure. Other materials can be substituted
      with GM permission, and the GM makes the final decision about what
      materials are available. All structures have 5 hp per technician level,
      but a hardness dependent on the material in question (0 for cloth, 5 for
      wood, 8 for stone).</p>

      <p>There are three types of structures that can be created: huts,
      platforms, and walls.</p>

      <p>Huts give cover from all sides except any entrances the technician
      chooses to leave. Huts provide cover and impede movement as walls do,
      except they only fill a 5 ft. space. This hut can comfortably sit 2
      people. Several huts can be combined together to form a single, larger
      hut.</p>

      <p>Platforms either raise terrain by 5 ft. in a single 5 ft. square, or
      create a bridge or platform up to 5 ft. wide and 15 ft. long. The
      platforms themselves are about an inch thick.</p>

      <p>Walls are 10 ft. tall and long, and impede movement unless a creature
      first climbs or destroys the wall. The technician may expend an additional
      gadget when creating the wall to create stairs to allow easy scaling on
      one side, and to allow someone climbing the wall from that side to stand
      on the top and fire, retaining partial cover from attacks coming from the
      other side.</p>
