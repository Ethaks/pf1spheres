      <p>At 18th level, when the soul weaver uses her heal ability, the target
      is also cured of all temporary and permanent negative levels (including
      the one gained if revived), as well as all ability drain.</p>

      <h2 id="toc36"><span>Gravewalker (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level, a soul weaver has become so adept at walking the paths
      of life and death, that both become evident in her body and soul. The soul
      weaver gains immunity to nonlethal damage, ability drain, and energy
      drain. Unintelligent undead ignore the soul weaver, treating her as
      another undead creature unless provoked. If the soul weaver should die,
      she may choose to rise 2d4 days later as a ghost.</p>
