      <p>The armiger may choose improvised weapons as a customized weapon set,
      grabbing objects from the environment to wield in a pinch. She may grab
      and wield a suitable unattended object as an improvised weapon as a free
      action any time she stows her active weapon. Additionally, the armiger
      gains the Barroom sphere (or a talent from that sphere if she already
      possesses the base sphere) as a bonus talent. Any improvised weapon
      benefits from the talents granted by the improvised weapon customization
      set, though she may only have a single such set.</p>
