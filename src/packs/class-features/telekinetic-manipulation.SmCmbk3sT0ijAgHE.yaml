      <p>The symbiat may use their telekinesis to manipulate the battlefield. So
      long as this effect is active, the symbiat may, as an immediate action,
      add either a bonus or a penalty equal to 1/2 his symbiat level (minimum 1)
      to one attack roll made within 60 feet of him. The symbiat must announce
      he will use this ability before the attack roll is made.</p>
