      <p>The sage may make a sunder attempt against an unattended, inanimate
      object or surface using his unarmed strike or the melee touch attack
      granted by the chi gong ability, adding his chi gong dice to the damage
      dealt. The bonus damage from his chi gong dice is not affected by Hardness
      or damage reduction. In addition, whenever the sage would damage a
      construct with his chi gong melee touch attack, the attack ignores any
      damage reduction the construct may possess.</p>
