      <p>Years of training and study made the blacksmith realize all items are
      fundamentally the same, granting him insight into the inner workings of
      magic items. The blacksmith chooses either Profession (blacksmith) or any
      one Craft skill. The blacksmith may use the chosen skill&#8217;s bonus in
      place of his Use Magic Device skill bonus.</p>
