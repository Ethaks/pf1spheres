      <p>While in wraith form, the wraith may spend a spell point as a move
      action to attempt to pass through objects thicker than his own space. The
      wraith may move up to his speed through solid matter. If the wraith does
      not end his movement in a space he could occupy, he is shunted back to his
      starting position, taking 1d6 untyped damage per 5 feet traveled.</p>
