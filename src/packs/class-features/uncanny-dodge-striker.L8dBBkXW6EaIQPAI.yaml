    value: >
      <p>At 3rd level, a striker gains the ability to react to danger before her
      senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught
      flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker
      is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to armor class if
      immobilized. A striker with this ability can still lose her Dexterity
      bonus to armor class if a creature successfully uses the feint action
      against her. If a striker already has uncanny dodge from a different
      class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below)
      instead.</p>
