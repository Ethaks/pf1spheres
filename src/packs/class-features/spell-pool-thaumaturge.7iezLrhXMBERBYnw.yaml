      <p>A thaumaturge gains a small reservoir of energy he can call on to
      create truly wondrous effects, called a spell pool. This pool contains a
      number of spell points equal to his class level + his casting ability
      modifier (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after roughly 8
      hours of rest.</p>
