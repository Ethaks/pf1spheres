      <p>At 11th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 3 steps instead of 2, to a minimum of a swift
      action.</p>

      <p>In addition to using Disable Device to sabotage mechanical gadgets, the
      technician can also use the Disable Device skill to tamper with magical
      effects as well. With 2d4 rounds of work (reduced to 1 round with the
      benefits of trapmaster and greater trapmaster), the technician may make a
      Disable Device check (DC 11 + the effect&#8217;s caster level) that
      dispels magical effects on a creature or area.</p>

      <p>Instantaneous effects cannot be disabled in this fashion. The
      technician may target a specific effect if he has identified it, otherwise
      the effect with the highest caster level is affected first. He may also
      target a magical item, in which case the magic is not dispelled, but is
      instead suppressed for 1d4 rounds. The technician must be touching the
      target to affect it in this way; he may use this power on an unwilling
      target, but must succeed at a melee touch attack, and must remain in
      contact with the target for the entire process (if this process requires 1
      round or longer, often the target must be grappled, helpless, unaware of
      the technician, or in some other way unable to get away from the
      technician for the duration).</p>
