    value: >
      <p>At 3rd level, a symbiat gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps
      and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In addition, he
      gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe.
      These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 symbiat levels thereafter (to a
      maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for the
      purpose of any feat or class prerequisite. The bonuses gained from this
      ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from another class).</p>
