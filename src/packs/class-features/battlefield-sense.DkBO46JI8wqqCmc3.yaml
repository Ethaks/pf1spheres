      <p>When unarmored and unencumbered, the symbiat&#8217;s second mind may
      subtly push the symbiat, protecting him from danger. The symbiat adds his
      Intelligence bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. These bonuses apply even
      against touch attacks or when the symbiat is flat-footed and increase by
      +1 for every 4 symbiat levels possessed to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.
      The symbiat loses this bonus when he is immobilized or helpless, when he
      wears any armor, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
