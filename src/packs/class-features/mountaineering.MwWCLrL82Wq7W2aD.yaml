      <p>The commander grants quick instructions to assist in climbing over
      various obstacles, including calling out handholds, footholds, and piton
      locations. All allies currently benefiting from one of the
      commander&#8217;s shouts or tactics gain a climb speed equal to 5 x the
      higher of the commander&#8217;s Charisma or Intelligence modifiers
      (minimum 5 ft.); allies who already possess a climb speed increase their
      existing climb speed by this amount.</p>
