      <p>The technician&#8217;s intuition pool increased by 1. Rather than
      spending a point of intuition before the d20 is rolled, he may spend his
      intuition after the die is rolled but before the results are revealed.
      This can change a failure into a success.</p>

      <p>A technician must have the intuition technical insight to select this
      insight.</p>
