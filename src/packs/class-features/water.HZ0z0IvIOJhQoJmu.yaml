      <p>Whether through ocean depths or over river rapids, the commander is a
      master of aquatic combat. When fighting in watery or aquatic terrain, the
      commander and any ally affected by one of his tactics or shouts never risk
      being swept away by water moving 60 ft. per round or faster, double the
      distance they can see underwater, do not take penalties as normal for
      attack and damage when fighting underwater with slashing or bludgeoning
      weapons, increase their base swim speed by 10 ft. (or gain a swim speed of
      10 ft. if they do not already have one), and gain a bonus on Swim checks
      equal to 1/2 the commander&#8217;s class level.</p>

      <h2 id="toc30"><span><span style="color: #993300">Group Focus
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>Starting at 5th level, the commander may fly into a strenuous and
      exhausting flurry as a standard action, shouting out commands, redirecting
      attention, calling out threats, and generally imposing his will and order
      upon the battlefield, restoring the martial focus of all allies who can
      see and hear him. If an affected ally would not benefit from regaining
      martial focus, they instead gain a morale bonus to their attack rolls,
      damage rolls, saving throws, AC, and CMD equal to the higher of the
      commander&#8217;s Charisma or Intelligence bonus for 1 round. The
      commander may use this ability 1/day at 5th level, and gains an additional
      use every 6 levels thereafter.</p>

      <h2 id="toc31"><span><span style="color: #993300">Logistic Specialty

      <p>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the commander learns a
      logistic specialty from the following list:</p>
