      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s time spent pounding iron and steel has
      translated into an ability to strike with such force that the impact of
      his blows punches through his opponent&#8217;s defenses with ease. The
      blacksmith ignores 2 points of damage reduction his target possesses when
      attacking with a melee weapon using the attack action, plus an additional
      point at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
