      <p>Whenever the commander uses an attack action to make a ranged attack,
      he may immediately spend a move action to allow each ally currently
      benefiting from one of his shouts or tactics to make a single ranged
      attack against the same creature as an immediate action.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level and every 6 levels thereafter, the commander may select a
      specific terrain he excels at coordinating battles in. The commander
      chooses one terrain and its associated benefits each time he gains this
      ability.</p>
