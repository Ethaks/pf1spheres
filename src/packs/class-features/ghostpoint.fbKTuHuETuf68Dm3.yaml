      <p>At 12th level, the soul weaver may, when using a spell, spell-like
      ability, sphere ability, or soul weaver ability, target the effect as if
      she were standing in the same square as one of her souls. If the magic
      effect requires a touch attack, the soul may make the touch attack for the
      soul weaver, using her bonuses. This expends the soul.</p>
