    value: >
      <p>When unarmored and unencumbered, the sage adds his Wisdom bonus (if
      any) to his AC and his CMD. In addition, a sage gains a +1 bonus to AC and
      CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four sage levels
      thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>

      <p>These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the sage
      is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless,
      when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a
      medium or heavy load.</p>
