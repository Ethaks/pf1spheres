      fails a saving throw to resist one of the sage&#8217;s esoteries or resist
      a combat maneuver, or when the sage succeeds on a combat maneuver attempt
      against a creature (including maintaining a grapple) that creature must
      succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the sage&#8217;s class level +
      his practitioner modifier) or be slowed (as the <a href="/time">Time</a>
