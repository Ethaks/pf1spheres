      teamwork feat he qualifies for as a bonus feat. The commander may share
      any one teamwork feat he knows with all allies currently benefiting from

      prerequisites. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the commander
      may share 1 additional teamwork feat he knows when using this enhanced
      tactic. This enhanced tactic may be taken multiple times, gaining a new
      teamwork feat each time.</p>
