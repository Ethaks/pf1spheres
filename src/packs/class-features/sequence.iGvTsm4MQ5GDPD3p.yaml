      <p>A prodigy may string together actions in combat, building momentum,
      setting her position, and unbalancing enemies to be able to execute
      powerful offensive and defensive techniques. Sequences have three parts:
      openers, link components, and finishers. The maximum length of a sequence
      is 4 links plus 1 link per 3 class levels. Attempts to add additional
      links have no effect and anything that would cause the sequence to lose a
      link acts normally. A prodigy may only have one sequence active at a time;
      any actions affect the currently active sequence. Any time a prodigy
      begins her turn without having added a link to her sequence since the
      beginning of her last turn, her active sequence loses one link. Should
      this reduce the sequence to 0 links, the sequence ends and must be started
      again. If the prodigy becomes dazed, dead, helpless, paralyzed, stunned,
      or unconscious, the sequence immediately ends.</p>

      <p>A sequence requires the rush induced by real danger. As such, a
      sequence cannot be started prior to rolling initiative and ends
      automatically 1 round after there is no longer any apparent immediate
      threat (such as a hostile creature capable of making an attack or casting
      a spell or sphere effect).</p>
