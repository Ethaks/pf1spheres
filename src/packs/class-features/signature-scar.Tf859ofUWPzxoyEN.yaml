    value: >
      <p>When the mageknight damages an enemy with a melee weapon or natural
      weapon, she may spend a spell point as a free action to give them a scar.
      The target may attempt a Fortitude save against a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 her
      mageknight level plus her casting ability modifier to avoid the scar. Any
      hit points regained by a scarred enemy are instead diverted to the
      mageknight unless she is already at her full hit point total. The scar
      fades away after 1 minute.</p>
