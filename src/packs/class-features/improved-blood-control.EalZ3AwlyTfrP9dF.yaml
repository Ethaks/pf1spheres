      <p>At 8th level, the crimson dancer&#8217;s magic becomes even stronger
      upon bleeding foes. When attempting to establish blood control with the
      Blood sphere, creatures with less than half their maximum hit points
      suffer a -6 penalty to their save, rather than a -4 penalty. Additionally,
      the crimson dancer can concentrate on blood control with only a move
      action, but still requires a standard action to establish it. Each round
      when she would concentrate on her blood control, she can spend 4 points of
      vitae to instead concentrate as a swift action, rather than a move
      action.</p>
