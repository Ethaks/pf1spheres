      <p>At 10th level, as a standard action the prodigy may spend two uses of
      her adaptation ability to grant a single combat or magic talent to an ally
      within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 class levels) for 1 minute. The
      ally must meet the prerequisites for the granted talent, though the
      prodigy is not required to do so. Any additional uses of this ability on a
      single ally ends the previous use.</p>
