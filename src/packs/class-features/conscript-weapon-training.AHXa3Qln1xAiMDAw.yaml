      <p>Starting at 6th level, the conscript gain a +1 bonus on weapon attack
      and damage rolls with all weapons from a single fighter weapon training
      group of his choice. This bonus increases by +1 at 10th level and every
      four levels thereafter. This counts as, and does not stack with, the
      fighter&#8217;s weapon training class feature.</p>
