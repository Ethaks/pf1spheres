      <p>The armiger gains a competence bonus to initiative equal to 2 + the
      bonus granted by her enhanced customization class feature while wielding a
      customized weapon. Additionally, she may draw a customized weapon set as
      part of rolling initiative; doing so allows this benefit to apply to the
      initiative roll.</p>
