      <p>The incanter may channel energy as the cleric class feature a total
      number of times per day equal to 3 + his casting ability modifier, using
      his casting ability modifier in place of Charisma when determining its
      associated saving throw. He must choose whether to channel positive or
      negative energy when he gains this ability. Once this choice is made, it
      cannot be changed.</p>
