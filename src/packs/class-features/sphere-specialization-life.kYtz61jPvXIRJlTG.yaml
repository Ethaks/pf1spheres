      <p><strong>Bolstering Essence (Sp):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter
      may grant himself temporary hit points equal to his incanter level as a
      free action. These hit points last for 1 round. He can use this ability a
      number of times per day equal to 3 + his casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Life Sight (Su):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter can give
      himself blindsight to a range of 10 feet as a free action for 1 round. He
      may use this ability a number of times per day equal to his incanter
      level. This ability only allows him to detect living creatures and undead
      creatures. This sight also tells him whether a creature is living or
      undead. Constructs and other creatures that are neither living nor undead
      cannot be seen with this ability. The range of this ability increases by
      10 feet at 12th level, and by an additional 10 feet for every four levels
      beyond 12th. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p><strong>Life Essence (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the incanter becomes
      immune to death effects and gains fast healing 1.</p>
