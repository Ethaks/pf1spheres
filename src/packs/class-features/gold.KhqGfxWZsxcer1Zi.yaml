      <p>Gold is the metal most closely associated with the sun, willpower, and
      vitality. By following a carefully designed formula and creating a small
      structure in an adjacent square using at least 50 gp worth of gold, the
      scholar and all allies in a 30 ft. radius of the structure are protected
      from the powers of negative energy and undeath, gaining a +2 morale bonus
      to saving throws against death effects, disease, and paralysis effects for
      a number of minutes equal to 1/2 her class level (minimum: 1). This bonus
      increases by +2 for every five class levels the scholar possesses. In
      addition, any undead creature attempting to enter the protected radius of
      the structure must succeed on a Will save or find itself prevented from
      entering. The structure can be destroyed if it takes a number of points of
      damage equal to 5 times the scholar&#8217;s class level; as long as the
      structure is not destroyed, the scholar can retrieve it and recoup the
      gold used in its construction as a move action.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Purifying Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar learns
      how to mix small amounts of gold flakes and holy water into her
      flashbangs, allowing her to damage undead with positive energy in addition
      to the flashbang&#8217;s normal effects, though the target must make a
      Will save instead of the Fortitude save normally granted. Undead creatures
      targeted by this ability take 1d6 points of positive energy damage per
      class level the scholar possesses. This ability has no effect on living
      creatures, unless they are also damaged by positive energy, such as most
      dhampirs. Undead who succeed on their Will save take 1/2 damage from this
      effect.</li>
