      <p>The hedgewitch selects one type of magic item (potions, wondrous items,
      and so on). She creates items of this type 25% faster than normal and gain
      a +4 bonus on Spellcraft checks (or other checks, as appropriate) to craft
      items of this type. She may select this secret multiple times; its effects
      do not stack. Each time she selects this secret, it applies to another
      type of magic item.</p>
