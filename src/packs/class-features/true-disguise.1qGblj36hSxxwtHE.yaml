    value: >
      <p>When the troubadour creates a persona of a different race, age, or
      gender, he is considered to have those qualities while in that persona not
      only for feats and class features, but also for the purpose of magic. This
      means that spells and magic items that grant different benefits depending
      on the creature&#8217;s race or subtype, age, or gender will react as if
      the troubadour possesses the mimicked qualities.</p>

      <p>The troubadour does not suffer any penalty to his Disguise skill when
      attempting to change his gender, race, or age.</p>
