      <p>At 13th level, whenever the sentinel uses her second wind, she can also
      ignore the following conditions: dazed, exhausted, frightened, nauseated,
      paralyzed, or stunned (if a condition would cause the sentinel to be
      unable to act, as long as she can take purely mental actions, she can use
      her second wind).</p>
