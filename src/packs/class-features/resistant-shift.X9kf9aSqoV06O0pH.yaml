      <p>When the shifter applies a shapeshift to herself and becomes a size
      category larger then she was before, she gains stalwart (if she makes a
      Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect
      on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely) for 1 round
      per 5 levels of shifter she possesses (minimum 1), or until she applies a
      new shapeshift to herself (whichever is shorter). When she applies a
      shapeshift to herself and becomes a size category smaller than she was
      before, she gains evasion (As the shifter bestial trait) for 1 round per 5
      levels of shifter she possesses (minimum 1), or until she applies a new
      shapeshift to herself (whichever is shorter).</p>
