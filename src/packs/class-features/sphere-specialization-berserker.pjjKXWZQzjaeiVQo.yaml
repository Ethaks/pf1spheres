      <p><strong>Iron Rage (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a conscript
      takes a penalty to their AC from the Berserker sphere, they also gain DR
      1/- for 1 round. At 5th level and every five levels afterwards, this DR
      increases by 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Steel Rage (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a conscript
      gains temporary hit points from the Berserker sphere ability, they gain an
      additional number of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 their conscript
      level.</p>

      <p><strong>Adamantine Rage (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a
      conscript takes a penalty to their AC from a Berserker sphere ability,
      they treat all creatures as battered for as long as the penalty lasts.</p>
