    value: >
      <p>Whenever the mageknight strikes an extraplanar creature with a weapon
      attack, she may spend a spell point as an immediate action to attempt to
      break the bonds that bind it to this plane. The extraplanar creature must
      make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her mageknight level + casting ability
      modifier) or be sent back to its home plane. On a successful save the
      creature is still staggered for 1d4 rounds. The banished creature can be
      resummoned as normal.</p>
