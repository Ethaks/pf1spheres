    value: >
      <p>While possessing another creature or object, the wraith may hide from
      the divine ability of the Divination sphere and spells of the Divination
      school and pass through wards that would affect a possessing creature such
      as magic circle against evil or the effects of a forbiddance spell. The
      wraith must attempt a Will save against the spell or sphere ability (even
      if it does not normally allow a saving throw). If he succeeds, the spell
      treats him as if he were his host (for instance, Divine Alignment would
      reveal only the host&#8217;s alignment, and forbiddance keyed to the
      host&#8217;s alignment would not damage the wraith). If the wraith&#8217;s
      saving throw fails, the spell functions against him as normal.</p>
