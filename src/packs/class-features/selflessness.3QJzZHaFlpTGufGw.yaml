      <p>A warden of selflessness puts the safety of their allies first, and
      themselves second. Whereas most believe these wardens to be foolhardy and
      careless, these wardens merely wish to protect their allies in any way
      they can; a wound can be healed and armour can be mended. These wardens
      are the embodiment of defense, usually making even a normally devastating
      attack not worthwhile.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Protection</p>

      <p><strong>Selfless Guard:</strong> A selfless warden&#8217;s guard feels
      safe and secure. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain
      DR/&#8212; equal to twice the warden&#8217;s guard bonus. Additionally,
      the warden may activate (succor) talents by expending an attack of
      opportunity instead of an immediate action.</p>

      <p><strong>Enduring Patrol:</strong> At 7th level, the warden may increase
      the activation time of patrol by 1 step or expend his martial focus when
      using patrol to grant all guarded allies within his area of patrol a
      delayed damage pool equal to their class level until the end of their next
      turn. Affected guarded allies benefit from any talents the warden
      possesses that affect his delayed damage pool. If he would reactivate his
      patrol before the end of his next turn, he can keep extending the duration
      of the ability by one additional round without increasing the activation
      time or expending his martial focus.</p>

      <p><strong>Energy Guard:</strong> At 11th level, the warden may spend a
      spell point when using his guard ability to provide the ally an amount of
      acid, cold, electricity and fire resistance equal to 4 x the
      warden&#8217;s guard bonus.</p>

      <p><strong>Cripple Defenses:</strong> At 15th level, whenever an ally
      within the warden&#8217;s guard range would attempt an attack roll against
      a creature, as an immediate action or by expending an attack of
      opportunity, the warden may force the creature to succeed a Will saving
      throw against his Protection sphere DC or suffer a penalty to their AC
      equal to his guard bonus until the end of his next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Selfless Imposition:</strong> At 19th level, whenever an ally
      the warden can see within 60 feet of him would be dealt damage, he can
      choose to transfer any amount of damage dealt to himself as an immediate
      action or by expending an attack of opportunity.</p>

      <h3 id="toc69"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Vigil
      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc70"><span>Resistant Guard (requires selflessness, warden
      12)</span></h4>

      <p>Whenever the warden would use his energy guard vigil ability, the
      resistance granted applies to all energy types, such as force, sonic,
      positive energy, negative energy, etc.</p>

      <h4 id="toc71"><span>Warded Sentry (requires selflessness)</span></h4>

      <p>Whenever the warden would use his patrol ability, he may spend a spell
      point to apply the effects of one (ward) talent to his area of patrol. The
      warden must pay any associated costs with the chosen (ward) talent, and
      lasts until the end of his next turn. If the warden would reactivate his
      patrol before the end of his next turn, he can keep extending the duration
      of the ward by one additional round without spending a spell point. The
      warden may only apply the effects of one (ward) talent to his patrol this
      way.</p>
