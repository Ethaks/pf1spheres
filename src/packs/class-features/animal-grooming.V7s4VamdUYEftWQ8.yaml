      <p>The blacksmith gains the Beastmastery sphere as a bonus talent.</p>

      <p>If the blacksmith possesses the maintenance class feature, by treating
      or grooming the ally as appropriate, the blacksmith can perform
      maintenance options on natural weapons, natural armor, and other body
      parts and appendages. Treat a creature&#8217;s natural weapons as
      manufactured weapons, natural armor as worn armor, and other body parts or
      appendages as the correct equipment when appropriate (such as a
      horse&#8217;s hooves as boots for the cobbling maintenance). If a
      maintenance would affect any number of manufactured weapons, it instead
      affects up to two of the ally&#8217;s natural weapons. Maintenance
      performed on an ally this way can take the form of grooming or pet care,
      such as cleaning and mending horseshoes, filing fangs and claws, or
      buffing and waxing shells to apply chosen maintenance options.</p>

      <p>When performing maintenance, the blacksmith can perform maintenance for
      one subordinate that does not count against the normal maximum number of
      allies he can perform maintenance for.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If the blacksmith possesses an archetype
      which alters or replaces the maintenance class feature with a similar
      ability that grants a number of allies long-term benefits (subject to GM
      discretion), the blacksmith can include one subordinate to receive
      benefits that does not count against the normal maximum number of allies
      he can grant benefits to (such as reserving table scraps to feed a pet
      wolf a meal or making a small mochaccino for a turtle familiar).</p>
