      <p>At 19th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 5 steps instead of 4, to a minimum of a swift action. In
      addition, when the technician is the direct target of an unwanted magical
      effect, as an immediate action he may attempt a Disable Device check to
      negate the incoming effect before it can affect him, as detailed under
      greater trapmaster.</p>
