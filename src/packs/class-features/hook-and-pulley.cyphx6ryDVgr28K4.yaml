      <p>The technician may create a gadget that allows him to manipulate
      objects from a distance. This gadget counts as a thrown weapon with a
      range increment of 20 ft. Make a ranged touch attack against an unattended
      object that he could hold in one hand. If successful, he may move that
      object to his hand as a free action. Targets whose natural reach includes
      the path that object must take (i.e., are within the line of effect) can
      make a Reflex save as an immediate action to attempt to grab the object as
      it flies by.</p>

      <p>Alternately, the technician may use this gadget to attempt a drag,
      trip, disarm, or steal combat maneuver at a distance. Performing a
      maneuver from a distance in this fashion does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity (except as normal when making a ranged attack), but requires
      the technician to succeed on a ranged touch attack against the target
      first before the maneuver may be attempted.</p>
