      <p>At 2nd level, a sentinel&#8217;s devotion begins to manifest in a more
      powerful fashion, granting her DR 1/- (this damage reduction stacks with
      similar damage reduction, such as that granted by wearing adamantine armor
      or the barbarian class feature). At 6th level and every four levels
      afterwards, this damage reduction is increased by 1.</p>
