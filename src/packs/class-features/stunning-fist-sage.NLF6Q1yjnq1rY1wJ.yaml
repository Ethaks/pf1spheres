      <p>The sage gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he would not
      normally qualify for it. The sage treats his class level as monk levels
      when determining all effects of this feat, including uses per day. In
      addition to his unarmed strikes, the sage may declare a Stunning Fist
      attempt whenever he attacks with the melee touch attack granted by his chi
      gong class feature.</p>

      <h2 id="toc77"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Skill
      Focus</span></span></h2>

      <p>The sage&#8217;s specialized training gives him keen insight into a
      variety of different subjects. At 3rd level and every three levels
      thereafter, the sage gains Skill Focus for a skill of his choice as a
      bonus feat.</p>

      <h2 id="toc78"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Signature Technique
      (Su)</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level the sage gains a powerful esotery from the following list
      that acts as his signature technique. The sage cannot select a signature
      technique unless he possesses the corresponding esoteric training package.
      Signature techniques follow all other rules for esoteries, including
      determining saving throw DCs and the number of ki points that can be spent
      when activating them.</p>
