      <p>When the armorist binds an implement, she may choose to bond with a
      specific piece of clothing, worn accessory, or jewelry as a
      &#8220;wearable implement&#8221; instead of a weapon, shield, or suit of
      armor. A wearable implement is slotless and does not take up a magic item
      slot.</p>

      <p>Wearable implements grant all their normal benefits as an implement
      while worn and also grant the wearer a benefit to one skill, chosen when
      the wearable implement is bound. Whether by its latent magic, unique
      design, or useful form, a wearable implement grants the Skill Focus feat
      in the chosen skill, unless the armorist already has Skill Focus in those
      skills.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> An armorist binds a pair of boots, which
      serves as a Time sphere implement and grants the armorist a bonus on
      Acrobatics checks due to her increased alacrity while wearing them. The
      chosen skill does not impact a wearable implement&#8217;s normal effects
      but is a good roleplay tool to justify why a wearable implement grants
      this bonus.</p>
