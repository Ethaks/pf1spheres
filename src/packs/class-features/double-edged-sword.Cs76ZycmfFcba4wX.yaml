    value: >
      <p>Whenever the blacksmith uses the sunder combat maneuver or a similar
      ability while using the attack action to cause a creature&#8217;s wielded
      weapon to gain the broken condition, he can damage the weapon in such a
      way that any attempt to make an attack with it inflicts 1d6 damage against
      the wielder, +1d6 per 5 class levels the blacksmith possesses. Repairing
      the equipment so that it no longer has the broken condition removes this
      effect.</p>
