    value: >
      <p>Whenever the blacksmith successfully deals damage to a creature&#8217;s
      armor with the sunder combat maneuver or a similar ability while using the
      attack action, the creature&#8217;s base speed is lowered by 5 ft. + 5 ft.
      per 5 class levels the blacksmith possesses; this ability cannot lower a
      target&#8217;s speed below 5 ft. Restoring at least 1 hit point to the
      damaged armor removes this effect.</p>
