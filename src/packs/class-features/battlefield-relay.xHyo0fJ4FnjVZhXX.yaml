    value: >
      <p>The symbiat may open the mind of an opponent, reading their intentions
      and relaying this information to his allies. Designating a target is a
      mind-altering effect, and the target is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2
      his symbiat level + his Intelligence modifier) to negate this designation.
      If a creature is successfully designated as a target, the symbiat and all
      allies within 60 feet of the symbiat gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
      attack rolls and skill checks made against the target, a +2 dodge bonus to
      AC against attacks coming from the target, and a +2 circumstance bonus
      saving throws against any effect originating from the target. While the
      symbiat must stop a previous psionic effect and spend an action to
      activate battlefield relay, this effect only counts towards the
      symbiat&#8217;s daily limit of psionic rounds if the target fails their
      saving throw. The symbiat and all allies to gain these bonuses must be
      within 60 feet of the target to be affected by battlefield relay. At 7th
      level, the bonus granted by battlefield relay increases to +3. This
      increases to +4 at level 13, and +5 at level 19.</p>
