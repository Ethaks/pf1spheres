      <p>At 2nd level, the soul weaver may touch a target and expend a use of
      channel energy to place a blight on them. The target is allowed a
      Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 soul weaver level + casting ability modifier),
      and on a failure, grows a patch of festering undead flesh where it was
      touched (this patch may be hidden under the skin if the soul weaver
      chooses, so a target might not even know it has been infected). Blight is
      considered a magical disease and is permanent until removed by magic or
      with the Heal skill. A blessing counters and dispels a blight, leaving
      neither blessing nor blight in place.</p>

      <p>A creature with blight suffers a -2 penalty to all saves against
      necromancy spells, Death sphere abilities, bound nexus powers, or blight
      abilities. A soul weaver may concentrate at any time to discover what
      creatures within close range possess blight.</p>
