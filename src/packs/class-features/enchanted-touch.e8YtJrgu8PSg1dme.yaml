      <p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to grant
      enhancement bonuses to all attacks she makes for 1 round per mageknight
      level. Her unarmed strikes, natural attacks, and wielded weapons gain a +1
      enhancement bonus which does not stack with any enhancement bonus her
      weapons already possess. This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 mageknight
      levels she possesses, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p>
