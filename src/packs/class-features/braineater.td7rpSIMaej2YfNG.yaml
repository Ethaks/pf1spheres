      <p>You gain Brain Consumption as a bonus feat. If you already possess
      Brain Consumption, you may immediately retrain Brain Consumption at no
      additional cost in money or time, selecting a new, valid feat (such as
      retraining a feat gained with level advancement to another valid feat).
      You may benefit from having two brains consumed at once, in which case you
      gain a bonus to one skill that one creature had ranks in and another skill
      that the other had ranks in.</p>
