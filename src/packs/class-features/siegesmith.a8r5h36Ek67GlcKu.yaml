      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s skill and knowledge of engineering make him
      particularly good at working on siege equipment. The blacksmith becomes
      proficient with all siege engines, lowers the costs to craft, enchant, or
      repair them by 25%, and no longer needs to pay any additional cost to
      craft a siege engine of masterwork quality (this reduction stacks with
      that granted by the economic crafting insight). In addition, the
      blacksmith gains a +2 bonus to Disable Device checks made to disable a
      siege engine and decreases the amount of time necessary to disable a siege
      engine by one round (minimum 1); at 5th level and every five levels
      thereafter the bonus to Disable Device checks increases by +2 and the
      number of rounds necessary to disable a siege engine decreases by an
      additional one round.</p>
