    value: >
      <p>Whenever the troubadour assumes a disguise, be it a non-base persona or
      through the Disguise skill, the troubadour gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his
      troubadour level to a single Profession skill associated with that
      disguise or persona, and may make checks with that skill untrained. For
      example, disguising himself as a sailor would grant him a bonus to
      Profession (sailor), while disguising himself as a servant would grant a
      bonus to Profession (servant).</p>
