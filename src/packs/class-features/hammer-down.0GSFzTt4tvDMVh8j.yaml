    value: >
      <p>When the blacksmith succeeds at a bull rush combat maneuver, he can
      make a trip combat maneuver at the end of the bull rush as a free action
      that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Even if he does not move
      with the target, the force of his attack may still trip his foe, but he
      takes a &#8211;5 penalty on the combat maneuver check to trip.</p>
