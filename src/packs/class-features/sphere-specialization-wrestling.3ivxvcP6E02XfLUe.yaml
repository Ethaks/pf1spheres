      <p><strong>Mobile Grappler (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever the
      conscript makes a successful grapple check to maintain a grapple, he may
      move himself and the grappled creature up to 5 ft. as a free action; this
      movement is in addition to the movement normally granted by using the move
      option available whenever he maintains a grapple. At 9th level and again
      at 15th level, he may move himself and that creature an additional 5
      ft.</p>

      <p><strong>Bear Hug (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever the conscript
      makes a successful grapple check to maintain a grapple, that creature must
      make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 conscript level +
      conscript&#8217;s Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or
      become fatigued for 1 round and lose their martial focus if they possess
      it. At 15th level, they are instead exhausted for 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Fatal Clutch (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript maintains a grapple against a creature, the grappled creature
      must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 conscript level +
      conscript&#8217;s Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or
      take damage equal to 1/4 of their maximum hit points (rounded down).</p>
