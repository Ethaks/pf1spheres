      <p>The incanter specializes in a sphere of his choice. The incanter gains
      that sphere as a bonus sphere and gains a +1 bonus to his caster level
      with that sphere. In addition, he also gains a series of abilities
      associated with that sphere, as detailed below. Some specializations have
      optional sub-specializations which may be chosen when the sphere
      specialization is gained. Like archetypes, these sub-specializations trade
      out one or more of a sphere specialization&#8217;s benefits for new
      abilities.</p>
