      <p>Some crystals are believed to assist with clarity, memory, and mental
      focus. The scholar learns to create small amulets or charms incorporating
      such crystals using crystals or precious gemstones, costing 8 hours and
      100 gp times the scholar&#8217;s class level to create. A crystalline
      focus may be sold for 1/2 its crafting cost, as long as it is currently
      functioning. As long as the scholar or an ally is wearing this amulet,
      they gain an insight bonus to concentration checks and Sense Motive checks
      equal to 1/2 the scholar&#8217;s class level (minimum 1), as determined at
      the time the amulet or charm was created. The scholar may rework a
      crystalline focus after leveling up to increase its bonus based on her
      current class level by paying the difference between its original crafting
      cost and the cost of creating one based on her current level. These charms
      do not occupy an item slot, but wearing more than one has no additional
      effect.</p>

      <p>The exact cleanliness, positioning, and presentation of the crystals to
      receive these benefits is very important, and extremely distressing events
      that would jostle or damage the charm, such as the wearer failing a Reflex
      saving throw or suffering a critical hit, have a 50% chance of throwing
      the charm out of alignment, breaking it and ending its benefits until the
      scholar spends at least 1 hour re-attuning it. A scholar who would lose a
      crystalline focus she is wearing in such a manner may expend her martial
      focus as an immediate action to prevent the charm from breaking. The
      scholar may create a purposely weaker foci, in which case the cost and
      bonuses are both reduced.</p>
