      <p>The armiger may choose unarmed strikes or a natural weapon as a
      customized weapon, training to quickly switch away from her other weapons.
      She may make unarmed strikes or a natural attack her active weapon as a
      free action or any time she stows her active weapon. Additionally, the
      armiger gains her choice of the Open Hand sphere or the Boxing sphere (or
      a talent from either of those spheres if she already possesses the base
      sphere) as a bonus talent. The armiger&#8217;s unarmed strike counts as a
      single weapon for the purpose of customization and thus can only be part
      of a single weapon set.</p>
