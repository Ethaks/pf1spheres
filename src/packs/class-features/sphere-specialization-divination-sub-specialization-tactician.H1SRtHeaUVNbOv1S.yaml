      <p>The following abilities replace forewarned and foretell.</p>

      <p><strong>Preempt Fumble (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, as an immediate
      action you can cause any creature within 60 feet to reroll any attack or
      saving throw it missed or failed that same round and accept the new
      result. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 +
      your casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Share Information (Su):</strong> At 8th level, when you use a
      (divine) talent you can choose a number of creatures equal to your casting
      ability modifier within 60 feet. Those creatures gain the exact same
      information you gain from the (divine) talent for as long as you maintain
      concentration on it, although this is not enough to distract them or
      impose penalties in any way.</p>
