      <p>The troubadour may create personas of any alignment, not just those
      within 1 step of his own. When in his base persona, the troubadour can
      change his alignment to appear to be anything as a free action taken once
      per round, such as for the purpose of deceiving magic that discerns
      alignment (such as detect alignment). The caster of the detection effect
      must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 15 + 1/2 the
      troubadour&#8217;s class level to see through the fabrication.</p>

      <p>The troubadour not only detects as this mimicked alignment, but if he
      so chooses, may also be affected as if this were his true alignment;
      spells and magic items, both helpful and hurtful, will interact with the
      troubadour as if he were this mimicked alignment.</p>
