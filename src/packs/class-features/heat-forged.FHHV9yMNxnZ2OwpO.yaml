      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s time spent working over a scorching forge has
      inured him to the effects of heat. The blacksmith becomes immune to
      nonlethal damage caused by heat, and gains fire resistance 10. This fire
      resistance increases by 5 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
