      <p>At 1st level, for a number of rounds per day equal to his class level
      plus his casting ability modifier, the wraith may gain the incorporeal
      subtype, with the following modifications:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The wraith takes half damage from non-magic weapons.</li>

      <li>The wraith cannot make weapon or natural weapon attacks while in
      wraith form unless he uses a weapon with the ghost touch special
      ability.</li>

      <li>Effects originating from corporeal sources that do not deal damage
      have a 20% chance to fail against the wraith instead of the normal 50%.
      Force effect are not subject to this failure chance.</li>

      <li>The wraith retains all worn equipment not exceeding his maximum load
      as well as the benefits from any magic items that grant a continuous
      effect, but gains no benefit from physical armor or shields.</li>

      <li>The wraith uses normal movement speeds (treat moving through solid
      objects as ground movement).</li>

      <li>When not on or in a solid or liquid, the wraith falls slowly and may
      glide, moving with a speed of 30 feet with maneuverability (perfect), but
      falling 1 foot for every 5 feet traveled (unless possessing a fly
      speed).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Activating this ability is a move action and ending it is a free
      action. He may not activate this ability if carrying a load greater than
      his maximum load. Should the wraith become corporeal while in a solid
      object, he is immediately shunted to the nearest empty space, taking 1d6
      untyped damage per 5 feet traveled.</p>
