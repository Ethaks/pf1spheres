    value: >
      <p>At 1st level, a sage gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he
      can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a
      sage&#8217;s ki pool is equal to his sage level + his Wisdom modifier. By
      spending 1 point from his ki pool, a sage can increase his speed by 20 ft.
      for 1 round. Alternatively, he can spend 1 point from his ki pool to give
      himself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. Each of these powers is
      activated as a swift action.</p>

      <p>Many esoteries and esoteric training packages require the sage to spend
      ki points to modify an effect; unless specifically stated otherwise, the
      sage cannot spend more ki points on an esotery or esoteric training
      ability than 1 + 1 per 5 class levels he possesses.</p>

      <p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or
      meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p><strong>Errata:</strong> This counts as both the casting and spell pool
      class features; a sage who gains a spell pool from another source
      calculates their total from both sources into a single pool as normal for
      a multiclass sphere caster. Sages gain two bonus talents if this is their
      first level in a casting class and qualify for a unified tradition,
      applying any appropriate casting limitations to their ki powers (so a sage
      with a casting tradition that includes the Verbal Casting drawback would
      apply that limitation to all of their ki powers, not just those that use
      magic talents).</p>
