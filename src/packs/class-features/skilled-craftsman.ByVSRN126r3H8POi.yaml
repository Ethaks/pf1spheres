      <p>Starting at 2nd level, the blacksmith may use Profession (blacksmith)
      in place of all Craft and Spellcraft skill checks made to create, modify,
      repair, and enchant weapons, armor, and shields, and he gains a competence
      bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Profession
      (blacksmith) checks. In addition, the smith learns to quickly repair
      damaged objects, restoring 2 hit points per class level he possesses to an
      object as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If the
      object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object
      is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of
      an object must be present for this ability to function. Magic items can be
      repaired by this ability, but the blacksmith&#8217;s class level must be
      equal to or higher than the caster level of the object. This ability does
      not affect creatures (including constructs). This ability has no effect on
      objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still
      repair damage done to such items. This ability can be used to repair
      nonmagical weapons, armor, and shields that have been destroyed, as long
      as all the pieces are together in an accessible location. At 5th level,
      the blacksmith no longer provokes an attack of opportunity for using this
      ability.</p>
