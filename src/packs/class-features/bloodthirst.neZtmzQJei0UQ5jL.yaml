      <p>At 3rd level, the crimson dancer develops an uncanny sensory perception
      for blood. She gains a limited scent ability out to 30 feet that can only
      be used to detect bleeding creatures, or that have less than half their
      maximum hit points. Additionally, she gains a bonus equal to her class
      level when attempting Survival checks to track a creature that has left a
      blood trail, and when attempting Perception checks to locate bleeding
      creatures.</p>

      <p>At 17th level, the crimson dancer gains blindsense 30 feet, but this
      vision can only sense creatures that can naturally bleed and that do not
      have bleed immunity.</p>
