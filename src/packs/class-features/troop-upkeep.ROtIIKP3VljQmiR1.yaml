      <p>By haranguing and encouraging his troops, the commander can enable them
      to draw on inner reserves of strength and fortitude they didn&#8217;t
      realize they possessed. Each round at the start of the commander&#8217;s
      turn, each ally currently benefiting from one of his tactics or shouts
      gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his Charisma or
      Intelligence bonus (minimum 1), whichever is higher. These temporary hit
      points disappear immediately if the ally ceases to benefit from at least
      one of the commander&#8217;s shouts or tactics.</p>
