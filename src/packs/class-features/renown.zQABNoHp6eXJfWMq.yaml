      <p>You know how to work a town to gain fame or notoriety. You gain the
      Renown vigilante social talent, treating your base persona as your social
      identity and any one persona you choose as your vigilante identity for
      this purpose. Establishing your renown in a community makes your face
      recognizable; when within the area of your renown, any persona you adopt
      that has the same face is instantly recognized by all as belonging to your
      base persona.</p>

      <p>Alternately, when you gain this actor training you may choose one of
      your personas to be your social identity for this purpose, but beginning a
      reputation from nothing is much more difficult; it takes twice as long the
      first time you establish the persona&#8217;s renown within a community. If
      you dissolve this persona, you may choose a new persona to be your social
      identity.</p>

      <p>You may select this actor training multiple times. Each time it is
      gained, you may choose and gain a new vigilante social talent, so long as
      it possesses Renown as a prerequisite.</p>

      <p>You must meet the prerequisites for this talent, and may treat your
      troubadour levels as vigilante levels when doing so.</p>
