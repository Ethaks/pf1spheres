      <p>The blacksmith learns to fight and maneuver in his armor better. While
      wearing armor, the blacksmith reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a
      minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his
      armor by 1. The blacksmith also learns to move at his normal speed when
      wearing medium armor. This counts as the fighter&#8217;s armor training
      class feature.</p>

      <p>In addition, the blacksmith gains an armor mastery feat (Armor
      Master&#8217;s Handbook pg. 16). The blacksmith must still meet all other
      prerequisites, but treats his blacksmith level as his fighter level when
      qualifying for armor mastery feats. The blacksmith must be at least 4th
      level to learn this insight. He may select this insight again at 8th and
      16th level. If he does, the blacksmith increases his armor training
      benefits by 1 and gains a new armor mastery feat. When the blacksmith
      gains this insight a second time, he learns to move at his normal speed
      when wearing heavy armor.</p>
