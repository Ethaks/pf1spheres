      <p>The sage gains the ability to manipulate his body and ki into a more
      powerful form. If the sage has the enhancer esoteric training package,
      whenever he uses its ability to grant himself a bonus to any of his
      physical ability scores, he also gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat if
      he did not already possess it, deals unarmed strike damage as a monk of
      his class level, uses his class level in place of his base attack bonus
      when determining the saving throw DCs and effects of any combat talents he
      possesses, and gains DR/- equal to half his class level (this damage
      reduction stacks with damage reduction of the same type from different
      sources).</p>

      <p>If the sage has the infuser esoteric training package, he may spend a
      ki point as a swift action to grant himself a +1 deflection bonus to his
      armor class, +1 per 4 class levels he possesses, for 1 minute. As long as
      this ability is active, the DC for the saving throw to resist the
      sage&#8217;s infuser ability increases by +5 and the sage is treated as
      being 1 size category larger than he actually is when determining whether
      or not he can use a combat maneuver against a given creature and what, if
      any, bonuses it receives to its Reflex saving throw for being larger than
      the sage.</p>
