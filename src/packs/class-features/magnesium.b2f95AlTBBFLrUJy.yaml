      <p>The scholar has learned to distill magnesium into a highly reactive
      material that, when ignited, burns at extreme temperatures and sheds a
      brilliant white light. Activating this imposition gives the scholar a
      brilliant magnesium torch that can be wielded as a light weapon the
      scholar is proficient with, dealing 1d6 fire damage with an 18-20/x2
      critical range and multiplier. This torch sheds bright light to a range of
      up to 30 ft., +5 ft. per 2 class levels, and increases the light level by
      one step within twice that range. This effect automatically dispels any
      darkness effect within its area whose spell level is equal to or less than
      half the scholar&#8217;s class level (rounded down), as well as any
      darkness effects from the Dark sphere whose effective caster level is
      lower than the scholar&#8217;s class level. Whenever the scholar confirms
      a critical hit against a target with this weapon, they catch fire, taking
      1d6 points of fire damage each round.</p>

      <p>A creature ignited by this ability is entitled to a Reflex saving throw
      at the start of their turn each round to attempt and extinguish the flame.
      If the fire is not extinguished, it burns out naturally after 1 minute.
      The scholar must have a hand free when she activates this imposition,
      otherwise the torch falls to the ground in an adjacent square, causing any
      unattended flammable items or substances in that square to catch fire.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Sun Flare [explosive]:</strong> The scholar mixes a blend of
      magnesium and phosphorescent materials into her flashbangs, allowing them
      to cause targets who fail their save against them to be blinded and shed
      bright light out to 30 ft. +5 ft. per two class levels for 1 round per
      class level. This effect automatically dispels any darkness effect within
      its area whose spell level is equal to or less than half the
      scholar&#8217;s class level (rounded down), as well as any darkness
      effects from the Dark sphere whose effective caster level is lower than
      the scholar&#8217;s class level. If the scholar&#8217;s flashbangs would
      normally be capable of blinding due to the scholar having at least 5 ranks
      in Craft (alchemy), the duration of this effect is doubled.</li>
