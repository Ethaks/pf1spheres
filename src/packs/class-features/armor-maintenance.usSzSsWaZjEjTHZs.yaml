      <p>The blacksmith and his allies reduce the armor check penalty of all
      armor they wear by 1 (minimum 0), and increase the armor bonus of their
      worn armor (but not shields) by +1. The armor bonus increases by +1 and
      the armor check penalty is reduced by an additional 1 at 5th level and
      every 5 levels thereafter. For the purposes of this ability, a standard
      set of clothing or similar equivalent (such as a wizard&#8217;s robes) is
      treated as light armor with an armor bonus and armor check penalty of
      0.</p>
