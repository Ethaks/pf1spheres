    value: >
      <p>Beginning at 10th level, instead of summoning equipment, the armorist
      may touch a piece of magical equipment and spend a spell point to increase
      its enhancement bonus by half the bonus she may grant to summoned
      equipment (minimum +1). This has the same duration as summoned equipment
      and causes the item to count as summoned equipment for the purpose of
      arsenal tricks. This requires a standard action to boost equipment being
      wielded by another, but can be done with the same action cost as summoning
      equipment if the armorist is already touching or wielding the piece of
      equipment. The armorist must be able to summon a type of equipment
      (weapons, shields, or armor) in order to boost a piece of similar
      equipment.</p>

      <p>Just as with summoned equipment, a boost cannot raise a piece of
      equipment&#8217;s enhancement bonus higher than +5, but can be traded for
      special abilities. Boosting an item a second time replaces the first
      boosting, and pieces of bound equipment cannot be boosted.</p>
