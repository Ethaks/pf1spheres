      <p>The shifter chooses one Alteration sphere talent (including the base
      talent that grants Blank Form) that she possesses that grants traits. When
      she applies a shapeshift to herself, she can choose one of the traits from
      that talent that does not cost an additional spell point to apply. That
      trait does not count towards her maximum amount of traits she may possess
      on a form. She may select this bestial trait once per every 4 shifter
      levels she possesses (minimum 1). Each time she does so she selects
      another talent.</p>
