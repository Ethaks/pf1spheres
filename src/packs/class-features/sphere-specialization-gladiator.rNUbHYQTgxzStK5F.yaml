      <p><strong>Armed Intimidator (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever the
      conscript is wielding a weapon with the performance special feature, or
      any weapon from the Gladiator Training discipline, he may add its
      enhancement bonus (if any) to his Intimidate checks.</p>

      <p><strong>Celebrity Combatant (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the
      conscript treats every battle as a performance combat as long as he is
      wielding a weapon with the performance special feature or a weapon from
      the Gladiator Training discipline, treating his allies and other creatures
      participating in the combat as a small, indifferent crowd for the purposes
      of determining what benefits he receives. In addition, whenever he begins
      a performance combat, he starts with a number of victory points equal to
      half his practitioner modifier (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Gladiatorial Weapon Master (Ex):</strong> Once the conscript
      reaches 20th level, whenever he threatens a critical hit with a weapon
      with the performance special feature or any weapon from the Gladiator
      Training discipline, he automatically confirms the critical threat. In
      addition, he is always treated as having the Improved Critical feat for
      any of these weapons.</p>
