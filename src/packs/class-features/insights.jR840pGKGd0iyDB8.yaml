      <p>Savants have learned to master their own bodies, pushing themselves in
      truly remarkable ways and using this knowledge, they may help or harm
      others as well. A savant may use insights a number of times per day equal
      to his practitioner modifier, which refreshes when he rests for 8 hours
      (or the equivalent). Whenever an insight calls for a saving throw, the DC
      is equal to 10 + 1/2 the savant&#8217;s level + the savant&#8217;s
      practitioner modifier. A savant may only use insights of his level or
      lower. Unless noted, using an insight is a free action that may be taken
      even when it isn&#8217;t the savant&#8217;s turn.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Conditioning:</strong> At 1st level, the savant may spend a
      use of insight when making a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution-based
      ability check or skill check (but not an attack roll, combat maneuver
      roll, or save) to roll twice and take the best result.</li>

      <li><strong>Skill Mimicry:</strong> At 1st level, when the savant sees a
      creature make a Strength or Dexterity-based skill check, he may spend a
      use of insight to use that creature&#8217;s modifier on checks made for
      that skill for a number of minutes equal to his practitioner modifier.
      This bonus includes attribute, class, feat, trait, and class skill bonuses
      but not other bonuses, such as circumstance, competence, insight, sacred,
      nor any bonus granted by a spell or magic item.</li>

      <li><strong>Talent Shift:</strong> At 1st level, the savant may spend a
      use of insight to swap one talent gained from flexible combat training for
      another talent. Any prerequisites of the talent must still be met. He
      keeps this talent for a number of rounds equal to his practitioner
      modifier; afterwards the talent is lost. The original talent is regained
      after a 10 minute rest.</li>

      <li><strong>Talent Mimicry:</strong> At 3rd level, when the savant sees a
      creature perform an attack, combat maneuver, or movement using or
      benefiting from a combat sphere or talent, he may spend a use of insight
      to temporarily gain one talent used for a number of rounds equal to his
      practitioner modifier. Any prerequisites of the talent must still be met.
      He may gain two talents in this way at 9th level and three at 15th
      level.</li>

      <li><strong>Reaver:</strong> At 3rd level, when a savant confirms a
      critical hit or reduces an opponent with a CR of at least half his
      character level to 0 or fewer hit points, he may spend a use of insight to
      activate his strain ability on his next turn without suffering the normal
      penalty.</li>

      <li><strong>Channel Strain:</strong> At 7th level, when using his strain
      ability, after successfully dealing damage with an attack action or
      succeeding on a combat maneuver, the savant may force the target creature
      to make a Fortitude save or suffer the penalty of the strain in place of
      the savant.</li>

      <li><strong>Battle Tempered:</strong> At 11th level, when the savant
      suffers the daze penalty from his strain ability, he may spend a use of
      insight to grant himself a bonus equal to his strain bonus on AC and saves
      for a number of rounds equal to his practitioner modifier.</li>

      <li><strong>Rebuke Death:</strong> At 15th level, when the savant is
      reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, he may use all his remaining insights to
      instead be reduced to 1 hit point. Effects that kill the savant outright
      without dealing hit point damage are not affected by this ability.</li>

      <li><strong>Battlemaster:</strong> At 19th level, the savant may spend a
      use of insight to make an attack action as a move action. This insight may
      only be used while benefiting from his strain ability.</li>
