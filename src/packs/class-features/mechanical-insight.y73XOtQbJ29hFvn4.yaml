      <p>The technician unlocks special options for his inventions, as detailed
      under that section. He may also give his independent inventions the
      clockwork subtype by adding the following properties (a construct or
      independent invention cannot possess more than one subtype):</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Winding:</strong> The construct must be wound with a special
      key in order to function. As a general rule, a fully wound clockwork can
      remain active for 1 day per HD, but shorter or longer durations are
      possible.</li>

      <li><strong>Vulnerable to Electricity:</strong> Clockwork constructs take
      150% as much damage as is normal from electricity attacks.</li>

      <li><strong>Swift Reactions:</strong> Clockwork constructs generally react
      much more swiftly than other constructs. They gain Improved Initiative and
      Lightning Reflexes as bonus feats, and gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC.</li>

      <li><strong>Difficult to Create:</strong> Increase the time and gp cost
      required to create a clockwork construct by 50% over normal.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In addition, he may add one of the following triggering mechanisms to
      his detonators, chosen whenever one is created. When using any of these
      triggering mechanisms, the detonator becomes inert if not detonated within
      10 minutes per technician level, and may be recovered to reclaim the
      expended gadget.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Land Mine:</strong> A tripwire trigger causes the detonator to
      explode when a creature enters its square. This allows the detonator to
      count as a snare trap for the purpose of Trap sphere talents such as
      Remote Trigger and Trap Wielder.</li>

      <li><strong>Remote:</strong> A remote trigger allows the gadget to be
      placed as a standard action, then triggered as a swift action from
      anywhere within medium range. He may place multiple detonators and
      detonate them with the same swift action, but as mentioned under
      detonators, multiple blast radiuses do not stack.</li>

      <li><strong>Timed:</strong> A timed trigger causes the detonator to
      explode after a set amount of time. A timed trigger has a duration of 1
      hour per technician level rather than 10 minutes per technician
      level.</li>

      </ul>
