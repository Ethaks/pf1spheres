      <p>The technician may create a gadget that heals a target within his
      natural reach for a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + his technician
      level. At 5th level and every four levels thereafter, this gadget heals
      for an additional 1d8. The technician may also create a gadget that
      empowers a willing target within his natural reach. That target gains a +2
      alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution for 1 minute per
