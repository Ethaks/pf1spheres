      <p>The sage has learned how to convert their ki into cloaks of brilliant
      energy that make them or their allies stronger and more powerful. The sage
      gains the <a href="/light">Light</a> sphere and the Encompassing Light
      talent as bonus talents. If the sage already possesses either of these
      talents, he may choose any other Light sphere talent in its place.</p>
