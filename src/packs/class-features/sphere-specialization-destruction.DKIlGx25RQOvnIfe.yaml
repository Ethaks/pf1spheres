      <p><strong>Intense Magic (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever the
      incanter creates a destructive blast that deals hit point damage, he adds
      1/2 his incanter level to the damage dealt (minimum +1). This bonus damage
      is not increased by Empower Spell or similar effects. This damage is of
      the same type as the destructive blast.</p>

      <p><strong>Penetrating Blast (Sp):</strong> At 8th level, when the
      incanter uses a destructive blast and rolls to penetrate spell resistance,
      he may roll twice and take the higher result. He may use this ability once
      per day at 8th level, and one additional time per day for every 6 levels
      beyond 8th.</p>

      <p><strong>Indestructible:</strong> At 20th level, the incanter becomes
      immune to critical hits and precision damage. When below 0 hit points, he
      does not die until his negative total is in excess of twice his
      Constitution score.</p>
