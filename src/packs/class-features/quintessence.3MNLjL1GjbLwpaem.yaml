      <p>Quintessence is the raw material from which the outer planes are
      formed, a nebulous substance which can subvert even the forces of time.
      The scholar can create and apply a spread of quintessence to a 5-foot
      square or a Medium-sized or smaller object within her natural reach (Large
      targets count as 2 Medium-sized targets, Huge targets count as 2
      Large-sized targets, Gargantuan targets count as 2 Huge-sized targets,
      etc.). Quintessence can also be applied to willing creatures, although
      such creatures are considered helpless so long as they are covered and
      cannot remove the quintessence by their own power. Creating and applying
      this quintessence takes 1 round, which provokes attacks of opportunity.
      The scholar may create a number of 5-foot squares equal to 1/2 her class
      level per day.</p>

      <p>A creature which moves across a square covered in quintessence must
      succeed at a Will save or become staggered for a number of rounds equal to
      the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Objects sealed
      within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; the creature
      does not grow older and its body functions virtually cease, putting
      creatures in a torpid state. The quintessence possesses 2 hit points per
      scholar level and can be removed by reducing it to 0 hit points.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Inhibitor [explosive]:</strong> The energies of the planes can
      be used to weaken the magic of foes. Creatures that fail their save
      against the flashbang&#8217;s initial effect take a penalty to their
      caster level equal to 1 + 1 for every 3 scholar levels you possess for 1d4
      rounds (minimum CL 1). Effects which remove confusion can be used to
      remove this caster level penalty</li>
