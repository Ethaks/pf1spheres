    value: >
      <p>Whenever the mageknight hits an enemy she has marked with a melee
      weapon or natural weapon, she may give the target a -4 penalty to attack
      and AC against creatures other than herself. This penalty lasts until the
      beginning of her next turn, or she may spend a spell point to make it last
      for 1 minute. This ability ends immediately if the mark ends, or if the
      target successfully hits her with a melee attack.</p>
