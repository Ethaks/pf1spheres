    value: >
      <p>At 1st level, the sage learns the chi gong technique, which allows him
      to wield his ki as a precise instrument, thrusting it into an opponent and
      disrupting their physiology or reinforcing a wounded ally. A sage&#8217;s
      chi gong is measured in d6&#8217;s: the sage begins with 1d6 chi gong,
      which increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter. The
      sage gains a melee touch attack that is treated as a light weapon and can
      be used whenever the sage could make an attack (such as during an attack
      action or attack of opportunity) dealing piercing damage to the opponent
      equal to his chi gong dice; the sage may also apply this bonus damage to
      his unarmed strikes or natural attacks. In addition, the sage can use this
      ability to heal a creature instead of damaging them by sealing their
      wounds together with ki as a move action, but this patchwork healing
      cannot restore a creature&#8217;s hit points above half their normal
      maximum.</p>
