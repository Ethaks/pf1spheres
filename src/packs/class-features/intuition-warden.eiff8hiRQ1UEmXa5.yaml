      <p>A warden of intuition is able to see danger before it becomes an issue,
      and uses this to protect their allies from potentially fatal attacks.
      These wardens attempt to prove as much information to their allies as they
      can, from dangerous traps to critical blows.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Divination</p>

      <p><strong>Precognitive Guard:</strong> An intuitive warden&#8217;s guard
      induces brief visions of the future. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s
      guarded allies gain a bonus to Reflex saves equal to his guard bonus, and
      they may always act in a surprise round.</p>

      <p><strong>Shared Sense:</strong> At 7th level, whenever the warden would
      cast a (sense) talent, he may grant a guarded ally the same (sense)
      talent, reducing the duration of both spells to 10 minutes per caster
      level. If the guarded ally would lose the benefits of the warden&#8217;s
      guard before this duration expires, the duration of the (sense) talent
      benefiting his previous ally is reduced to 1 minute, or the remaining
      duration, whichever is lower. The warden must pay any associated costs
      that the (sense) talent requires.</p>

      <p><strong>Portent Patrol:</strong> At 11th level, the warden may spend a
      spell point when using his patrol ability to gain subtle glimpses into the
      future. At the start of the warden&#8217;s turn, roll two d20s; as an
      immediate action, the warden may replace a d20 roll made by an ally within
      his area of patrol with one of the d20s he rolled as part of using this
      ability. The warden may replace a d20 roll as a free action that can be
      taken outside of his turn if the ally is guarded by the warden. Any
      unspent d20s are lost at the end of the warden&#8217;s next turn. If the
      warden would reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he may
      keep extending the duration of this ability by one additional round
      without spending a spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Foresight:</strong> At 15th level, whenever an enemy within the
      warden&#8217;s guard range would succeed a critical hit, as an immediate
      action, the warden may spend a spell point to force the attacker to
      succeed a Will saving throw against his Divination sphere DC or have the
      critical hit reduced to a normal attack.</p>

      <p><strong>True Diligence:</strong> At 19th level, whenever the warden
      would begin a guard, he may spend a spell point to gain the benefits of
      the True Seeing advanced Divination talent with a range of 60 feet. This
      lasts until the warden would regain his spell points or whenever he would
      have no guarded allies, whichever comes first.</p>

      <h3 id="toc56"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Vigil
      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc57"><span>Communal Perception (requires intuition, warden
      12)</span></h4>

      <p>The warden and his guarded allies may spend a standard action at any
      point to share their senses with the warden or another guarded ally, as
      long as the intended ally is within medium range. This grants the ally the
      ability to see, smell, hear, etc. whatever the other ally does, but is
      affected by dense materials as if it were a (divine) talent.</p>

      <h4 id="toc58"><span>Insightful Guard (requires intuition)</span></h4>

      <p>The warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a circumstance bonus to two
      Knowledge skills of the warden&#8217;s choice equal to twice the
      warden&#8217;s guard bonus. This choice is made the first time the warden
      begins a guard, with all guards he creates after the first using the
      chosen skills until the warden next regains spell points.</p>
