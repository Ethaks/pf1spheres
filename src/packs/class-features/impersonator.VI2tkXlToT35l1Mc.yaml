      <p>If the troubadour spends 10 minutes observing an individual, then
      impersonates that individual via the Disguise skill, he suffers only half
      the usual penalty when meeting someone who is familiar with that
      individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a
      50% chance of finding the troubadour instead of the actual individual
      (which increases to 100% if the individual wouldn&#8217;t normally be able
      to be found via magic, such as by being dead or protected in some other
      way), and divination spells and abilities used on the troubadour give
      results as if he were the actual individual. A troubadour must be at least
      10th level to select this actor training.</p>
