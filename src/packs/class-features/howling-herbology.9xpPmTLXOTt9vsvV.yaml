      <p>The mandrake root is feared in myth and legend for its ability to rend
      the life from mortals with its banshee-like wail. The scholar knows that
      while much of this is simply myth, the root does contain certain
      properties that gave rise to the legends. By ingesting a small portion of
      ground mandrake root mixed with various catalyzing agents, the scholar is
      able to unleash a piercing scream that deals an amount of sonic damage
      equal to 1d4 per class level to all creatures within a 30 ft. radius
      (Fortitude save for half). This ability affects objects and undead. The
      scholar herself is immune to the damage from this effect.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Sonic Shriekers [explosive]:</strong> Scholars with the
      howling herbology material imposition may enhance their flashbangs with
      mandrake root, granting them thunderous power. In addition to the
      flashbang&#8217;s normal effects, the target also takes 1d6 points of
      sonic damage per class level the scholar possesses, and the DC for
      Fortitude saves against flashbangs modified with this imposition increases
      by 1, +1 for every 5 class levels the scholar possesses. Creatures who
      succeed on their Fortitude save against the flashbang take 1/2 damage from
      this effect. The damage and effects from this ability apply to objects and
      undead.</li>
