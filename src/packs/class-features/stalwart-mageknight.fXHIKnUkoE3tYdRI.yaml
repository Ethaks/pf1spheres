      <p>At 3rd level, a mageknight can use mental and physical resiliency to
      avoid certain attacks. If she succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw
      against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she
      instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless mageknight does not gain
      the benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>
