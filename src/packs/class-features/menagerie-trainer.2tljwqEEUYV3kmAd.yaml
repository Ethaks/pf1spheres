      <p>The armiger gains the Beastmastery sphere as a bonus talent. The
      armiger can attune her customized weapons to her animal allies by training
      and working with her animal allies. As part of customizing a weapon, the
      armiger can attune that customized weapon to one animal ally. Each
      customized weapon can only be attuned to a single animal ally, but an
      animal ally can be attuned to more than one customized weapon.</p>

      <p>While the armiger has the animal-attuned customized weapon as her
      active weapon, the attuned animal ally also counts as possessing the
      animal-attuned customized weapon&#8217;s combat talents for all purposes,
      including skill ranks, and is aware of how to use these talents. The
      animal ally must be able to see or hear the armiger in order to use the
      animal-attuned customized weapon&#8217;s combat talents. The animal ally
      uses Wisdom as their practitioner modifier if it does not already possess
      a practitioner modifier. The animal ally cannot gain or benefit from
      combat talents it could not ordinarily possess (such as the Beastmastery
      or Leadership spheres) or any combat spheres the creature could not
      perform normally (such as using Alchemy (formulae) talents or the Trap
      sphere).</p>

      <p>If the animal ally would benefit from a sphere or talent that allows
      them to maintain or perform an action for a period of time, such as
      readying a Boxing sphere counter punch, Guardian sphere patrol, or
      sustaining a Warleader tactic, the animal ally can continue to use those
      talents even if the animal-attuned customized weapon is not the
      armiger&#8217;s active weapon. The animal ally loses access to those
      talents at the start of the armiger&#8217;s next turn.</p>
