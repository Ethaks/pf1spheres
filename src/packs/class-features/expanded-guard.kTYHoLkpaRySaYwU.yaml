      <p>The warden&#8217;s incredible vigilance over his allies begins to
      broaden. At 5th level, the warden may have up to two guarded allies at one
      time. The warden may have an additional guarded ally at one time at 11th
      and 17th level. If the warden would attempt to guard another creature
      beyond this maximum, the warden must choose a guarded ally to lose the
      benefits of his guard.</p>
