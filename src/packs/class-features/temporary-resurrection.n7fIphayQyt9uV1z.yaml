    value: >
      <p>At 16th level, the soul weaver may expend a soul to bring a creature
      who has died within 48 hours back to life. This lasts for 24 hours, and
      the target is returned to full health (although they do not recover other
      things, such as spells or spell points already used), and the target gains
      1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this ability.</p>

      <p>This negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently
      raised from the dead. The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not
      undead) for the purpose of effects that revive dead creatures. Once a
      creature has been revived with temporary resurrection, this ability cannot
      be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.</p>
