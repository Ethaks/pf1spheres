      <p>Once per day at 4th level, a fey adept may grant himself the ability to
      see all things as they truly are to a range of 120 feet for 1 round per
      level. The fey adept sees through magical darkness, notices secret doors
      hidden by magic, sees the exact locations of creatures or objects under
      blur or displacement effects, sees invisible creatures or objects
      normally, succeeds at all saving throws against illusions and sees through
      them naturally, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or
      transmuted things. The fey adept may use this ability an additional time
      per day for every 4 levels beyond 4th, to a maximum of 5 times at 20th
      level. This does not allow the target to see through mundane disguises,
      non-magical means of hiding things, fog, or other such effects.</p>

      <p>This cannot be combined with other magic that enhances the senses, such
      as a crystal ball.</p>
