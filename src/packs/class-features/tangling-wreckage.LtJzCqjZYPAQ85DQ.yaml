    value: >
      <p>Whenever the blacksmith uses the sunder combat maneuver or a similar
      ability while using the attack action to cause a creature&#8217;s worn
      armor to gain the broken condition, he can damage the equipment in such a
      way that it causes the target to become entangled as long as they are
      wearing the equipment. Repairing the equipment so that it no longer has
      the broken condition removes this effect.</p>
