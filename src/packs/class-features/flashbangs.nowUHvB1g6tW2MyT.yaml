    value: >
      <p>At 2nd level, the scholar learns how to create unstable preparations
      using various salts and minerals that she can hurl at a creature as a
      ranged touch attack with a range of 30 ft. + 10 ft. per class level,
      dealing 1d4 bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage, and forcing the
      target to succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the scholar&#8217;s
      class level + her Intelligence modifier) or be deafened and dazzled for
      1d4 rounds; in addition, whenever a creature fails their saving throw
      against one of the scholar&#8217;s flashbangs, she may recover her martial
      focus as an immediate action. Preparing and throwing a flashbang is a
      standard action. If the scholar has at least 5 ranks in the Craft
      (alchemy) skill, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning, slashing and piercing
      damage and is instead blinded and deafened for 1d4+1 rounds on a failed
      Fortitude saving throw.</p>

      <p>Some material impositions grant secondary effects that have the
      [explosive] descriptor; these impositions allow the scholar to expend her
      martial focus when using a flashbang to add additional effects as
      described in their entry. You can only add one [explosive] to a given
      flashbang.</p>
