      <p>Whenever one of the warden&#8217;s guarded allies would be dealt damage
      by an enemy, as long as the enemy can see or hear the warden, he may
      expend his martial focus and an attack of opportunity to challenge the
      enemy. If the warden possesses the Swift Guardian talent, he does not need
      to expend his martial focus as part of using this ability.</p>
