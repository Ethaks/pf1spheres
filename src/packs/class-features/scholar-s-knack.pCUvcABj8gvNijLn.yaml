      <p>At 2nd level and at every two levels thereafter, the scholar gains a
      scholar&#8217;s knack from the below list. Unless otherwise noted, all
      scholar&#8217;s knacks are extraordinary abilities.</p>

      <h4 id="toc7"><span>Academic Knowledge</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar adds half her class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge
      skill checks and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained. If the
      scholar succeeds on a Knowledge check to identify a creature that she has
      successfully scouted, she may spend a move action to instruct her allies
      on how best to take it down, granting them a +2 bonus on combat maneuver
      checks and to the DCs of any abilities used against the creature for 1
      minute.</p>

      <h4 id="toc8"><span>Aeronautics</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar has learned how to construct a basic gliding apparatus that
      can be quickly assembled and disassembled for easy use. It takes the
      scholar 1 hour to assemble the glider, and it has a number of hit points
      equal to the scholar&#8217;s class level, hardness equal to twice her
      Intelligence bonus (minimum 2), and weighs 10 lbs. The scholar may attach
      the glider to her or an ally&#8217;s pack or clothing as a standard
      action; while it is attached, the character can make a DC 15 Fly check to
      fall safely from any height without taking falling damage. When falling
      safely, they may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 ft.
      laterally for every 10 ft. they fall. Allies may use a glider in this
      manner once for a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 + the
      scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier before it breaks, and the scholar
      can use the glider in this way a total number of times per day equal to
      her Intelligence bonus (minimum 1) for the same duration; any attempt to
      exceed this usage results in failure and causes the glider to break,
      forcing the scholar to spend an hour building a new one before it can be
      used again. Only one glider can be attached to a single creature at a
      time.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, the scholar and any ally given a glider are able to fly
      with a speed of 30 ft. and average maneuverability. The duration that the
      glider lasts during a single use increases to a number of minutes equal to
      1 + the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus. In addition to using the
      glider to fall safely, the scholar can use the glider to fly a total
      number of times per day equal to 1 + her Intelligence bonus; any attempt
      to exceed this usage or remain in flight after the glider&#8217;s normal
      duration resulsts in failure and causes the glider to break, forcing the
      scholar to build a new one before it can be used again. Allies using a
      glider still suffer breakage after the first usage.</p>

      <p>If the scholar is at least 10th level, her gliders instead grant a fly
      speed of 60 ft. with good maneuverability, and may now stay aloft during a
      single use for a number of hours equal to 1/2 the scholar&#8217;s class
      level (rounded down).</p>

      <h4 id="toc9"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Amateur Arcanist
      [CS]</span></span></h4>

      <p>The scholar gains the Basic Magical Training and Advanced Magical
      Training feats, using her Intelligence modifier as her casting ability
      modifier.</p>

      <h4 id="toc10"><span>Animal Training, Large</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar&#8217;s familiar takes the form of an animal companion of
      her choice, using her scholar level as her effective druid level. The
      animal retains the special abilities and the Intelligence score of the
      scholar&#8217;s familiar, but also has the statistics and abilities of an
      animal companion. If the animal is dismissed, is lost, or dies, it can be
      replaced in the same way as a normal familiar can be.</p>

      <p>The scholar must have the small animal training knack to select this
      knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc11"><span>Animal Training, Small</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar gains a familiar, treating her class level as her arcane
      spellcaster level. The scholar is unable to utilize the share spells,
      deliver touch spells, or scry on familiar abilities normally granted to a
      familiar, but is still considered to have them for the purposes of
      determining what archetypes her familiar qualifies for. If a familiar is
      dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a
      specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per scholar level. The ritual takes 8
      hours to complete.</p>

      <h4 id="toc12"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Arcane Studies
      [CS]</span></span></h4>

      <p>The scholar furthers her magical studies. Each time the scholar takes
      this knack, she gains three bonus magic talents; these bonus talents may
      spent on any talent she qualifies for, or to gain one or more new base
      magic spheres. The scholar may take this knack up to a total of three
      times. The scholar must have the amateur arcanist knack to select this
      knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc13"><span>Astrology</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar has learned to divine helpful information from the
      positions of the stars and planets. Once per day, the scholar may spend
      one hour studying star charts, the position of the celestial bodies, and
      other relevant astrological data to gain important insights into the
      day&#8217;s challenges, granting a pool of insight points equal to half
      the scholar&#8217;s class level (minimum 1) plus her Intelligence bonus.
      The scholar may spend a point from this pool as part of an attack roll,
      saving throw, or skill check to add 1d4+1 to the result; the scholar may
      spend a point to grant this bonus to an ally, but must spend an immediate
      action to do so.</p>

      <h4 id="toc14"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Breakthrough
      Historian</span> [BaP/CS]</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar furthers their ability to teach the past and predict the
      future. The scholar gains the <a href="/divination">Divination</a> sphere
      as a bonus talent. If the scholar possesses a drawback which removes the
      divine ability, she must buy back that drawback with this bonus talent. In
      addition, the scholar gains one (divine) talent as a bonus talent and
      Scholar Of Past And Future as a bonus feat. The scholar must have the
      amateur arcanist knack to select this knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc15"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Chronomancy,
      Amateur</span> [CS]</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar creates a small mechanical timepiece, similar to a holy
      symbol, that grants the <a href="/time">Time</a> sphere, a spell pool
      equal to 1 + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), uses Intelligence as
      her casting ability modifier, and treats her caster level as being equal
      to 1/2 her class level when using the Time sphere for as long as the
      timepiece is in her possession; this stacks normally with caster levels
      gained from other sources. If this is the scholar&#8217;s first time
      gaining a magic talent from any source, this is treated as the casting
      class feature and grants the scholar two bonus talents as normal, these
      talents must be used to gain talents in the Time sphere. The scholar loses
      these benefits if she loses possession of the timepiece; if the timepiece
      is lost or stolen, the scholar may assemble a new one during an 8 hour
      rest. Only the scholar may use this timepiece, and it does not provide any
      benefit to anyone other than the scholar.</p>

      <h4 id="toc16"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Chronomancy</span>
      [CS]</span></h4>

      <p>As long as she has possession of the timepiece created with the amateur
      chronomancy talent, the scholar gains three additional talents from the
      Time sphere and is considered a Mid-Caster when determining her caster
      level with the Time sphere. In addition, her spell pool is now equal to
      1/2 her class level + her Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p>The scholar must have the amateur chronomancy knack to take this
      knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc17"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Chronomancy,
      Advanced</span> [CS]</span></h4>

      <p>As long as she has possession of the timepiece created with the amateur
      chronomancy talent, the scholar gains three additional talents from the
      Time sphere and treats her class level as her caster level with the Time
      sphere; this stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources.
      In addition, her spell pool is now equal to her class level + her
      Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p>The scholar must have the amateur chronomancy and chronomancy knacks to
      take this knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc18"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Crafting Genius</span>
      [CS]</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar gains one of the following crafting feats: Brew Potion,
      Craft Rod, Craft Staff, Craft Wand, Craft Wondrous Item, or Forge Ring.
      The scholar uses her class level as her caster level but must otherwise
      meet the prerequisites of the chosen feat (so a 4th level scholar could
      take Brew Potion or Craft Wondrous Item with this knack, but not take
      Craft Rod until she was at least 9th level).</p>

      <p>In addition, the scholar gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on
      all skill checks made as part of the crafting process, and can bypass the
      normal restrictions for spell prerequisites on potions, spell trigger, and
      spell completion items by adding 3 + the level of the prerequisite spell
      (or 3 + 1/2 the caster level of the ability to be added if using a magic
      sphere effect) to the crafting DC. The scholar always treats her class
      levels as caster levels when determining the effects of items she crafts
      herself.</p>

      <p>This knack may be taken multiple times, granting an additional feat
      from the above list each time but providing no further benefits.</p>

      <p>The scholar must have the amateur arcanist knack to take this
      knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc19"><span>Cunning Socialite</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar learns to leverage her keen insight to her advantage in
      social settings. Whenever the scholar has successfully used the scout
      ability to identify a creature&#8217;s weaknesses, she gains an insight
      bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense
      Motive checks made against the target, as well as to Intimidate checks
      made to improve the creature&#8217;s attitude towards the scholar.</p>

      <h4 id="toc20"><span>Cunning Attacker</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar&#8217;s preference for brains over brawn translates into an
      ability to plan attacks her opponent cannot easily counter. Whenever the
      scholar has successfully used the scout ability to identify a
      creature&#8217;s weaknesses, she may use her Intelligence bonus in place
      of her Strength modifier for melee attack rolls, combat maneuver checks,
      and in place of her Dexterity modifier with ranged attack rolls against
      the target. In addition, the scholar also gains a +1 insight bonus on all
      attack rolls made while using her Intelligence bonus to hit, plus an
      additional +1 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>

      <h4 id="toc21"><span>Experimental Evolution</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar performs various experiments with breeding, chemical
      modification, or other techniques to create powerful and unusual creatures
      loyal to her. When the scholar learns this knack, a familiar, animal
      companion, or mount she possesses gains a pool of evolution points equal
      to 1 + 1 per 4 class levels she possesses that can be used to give the
      creature evolutions as though it were an eidolon. If the scholar possesses
      multiple familiars, mounts, or companions, she may divide these evolution
      points amongst them however she chooses. Once a creature has spent its
      evolution points on a given evolution, the choice cannot be changed until
      the next time the scholar gains a class level. If the scholar&#8217;s
      companion creature dies or is otherwise permanently lost, she regains any
      evolution points spent on it and may apply them to a new creature after 1
      week of training and experimentation.</p>

      <h4 id="toc22"><span>Expert Healing</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar adds half her class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all
      Heal checks. Whenever a creature regains hit points due to the
      scholar&#8217;s use of the Heal skill (including her medical training
      class feature), or from an alchemical item the scholar has prepared (such
      as the salve formulae from the Alchemy sphere), any healing in excess of
      their normal maximum hit point total is applied as temporary hit points
      which last for 1 hour per class level the scholar possesses.</p>

      <h4 id="toc23"><span>Genetic Modification</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar gains Evolved Familiar and Improved Familiar as bonus
      feats, even if she would not otherwise qualify for them. The scholar uses
      her class level in place of her arcane caster level when determining what
      improved familiars she qualifies for. If the scholar has the large animal
      training knack, she may add the bonuses for level normally gained by her
      animal companion (bonus HD, feats, Strength and Dexterity bonuses, skill
      points, tricks, etc.) to her improved familiar, subtracting the
      familiar&#8217;s base form&#8217;s CR from her effective druid level when
      determining its advancement. Regardless of the improved familiar&#8217;s
      type, bonuses gained from progressing as an animal companion, such as
      bonus HD, use the normal advancement rules presented in the animal
      companion base statistics table. The scholar must have the small animal
      training knack to select this knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc24"><span>Lightning Rod</span></h4>

      <p>Scholars with this knack gain a masterwork quarterstaff specially
      modified with mechanical and alchemical attachments that allow them to
      channel, store, and redirect electrical energy. This quarterstaff can be
      enchanted as a standard weapon of its type. If it is ever broken or
      destroyed, the scholar cannot use the abilities granted by this knack (or
      the improved lightning rod knack) until she spends 8 hours modifying
      another quarterstaff of at least masterwork quality. The scholar can spend
      an immediate action whenever she would be damaged by an attack dealing
      electricity damage to negate an amount of electricity damage up to 5 x her
      class level. In addition, the scholar can spend a full-round action while
      wielding her lightning rod quarterstaff to create a small localized storm
      that creates a bolt of lightning targeting one enemy within 60 ft. of the
      scholar and dealing 1d6 per class level electricity damage (Reflex halves,
      DC 10 + 1/2 scholar&#8217;s class level + her Intelligence modifier). The
      scholar can maintain this effect each round as a standard action,
      generating a new bolt of lightning each time she does so.</p>

      <h4 id="toc25"><span>Lightning Rod, Improved</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar&#8217;s understanding of atmospheric phenomenon and ability
      to control and manipulate atmospheric conditions with her lightning rod
      quarterstaff reaches new heights. The scholar can spend a standard action
      while carrying or wielding her quarterstaff to raise or lower the
      temperature within 30 ft. around herself by up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit per
      class level, simultaneously granting herself and any allies within the
      affected area fire resistance (if she increases the temperature) or cold
      resistance (if she lowers the temperature) equal to her class level. The
      scholar and any allies granted resistance by this ability are also immune
      to nonlethal damage due to exposure to extreme temperatures. In addition,
      the scholar can spend 1 minute focusing on nothing but activating her
      lightning rod to change the weather in the local area over a 1 mile radius
      centered on her. She can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and
      season of the area she is in, and can also use this ability to cause the
      weather in the area to become calm and normal for the season.</p>

      <table class="wiki-content-table">

      <tr>

      <th>Season</th>

      <th>Possible Weather</th>

      </tr>

      <tr>

      <td>Spring</td>

      <td>Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

      <td>Summer</td>

      <td>Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

      <td>Autumn</td>

      <td>Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

      <td>Winter</td>

      <td>Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>

      <td>Late Winter</td>

      <td>Hurricane-force winds or early spring</td>

      </tr>

      </table>

      <p>The scholar can control the general tendencies of the weather, such as
      the direction and intensity of the wind. She cannot control specific
      applications of the weather&#8212;where lightning strikes, for example, or
      the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as the scholar left it
      for up to one hour, or until she uses this ability to designate a new kind
      of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory
      conditions are not possible simultaneously. The scholar must have the
      lightning rod knack to select this knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc26"><span>Liquefying Injections</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar may deliver one poison she has prepared or knows an Alchemy
      talent for as a melee touch attack; this poison is treated as being a
      contact poison even if it normally would not be. In addition to the
      poison&#8217;s normal effects, targets who fail their saving throw begin
      to liquefy.</p>

      <p>The first time a target fails a saving throw from a poison delivered by
      this ability, they take a -5 penalty to their natural armor (minimum 0)
      for 24 hours. The second time a target fails a saving throw against a
      poison delivered by this ability, they take 5 points of Dexterity and
      Strength damage. The third time a target fails a save against a poison
      delivered by this ability, they are permanently transformed into an ochre
      jelly, gaining the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom,
      and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own and losing all
      class abilities, racial abilities, and other class or level benefits.
      Multiple instances of this ability throughout the day stack, though any
      ability that would cure the initial poison also removes all effects of
      this ability except for the final transformation. Creatures transformed
      into an ochre jelly revert to their original form upon death, but can
      otherwise only be restored to their original form via a miracle, wish, or
      similar effect. This is a polymorph effect.</p>

      <p>Scholars must be at least 6th level to select this knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc27"><span>Martial Study</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar chooses a single combat sphere she possesses; she may use
      her class level in place of her base attack bonus when determining her
      bonus to hit, combat maneuver bonus, combat maneuver defense, ability DCs,
      and all other functions of the sphere normally determined by her base
      attack bonus when using talents or abilities granted by that sphere. The
      scholar may take this knack multiple times, choosing a different combat
      sphere each time. The scholar may not select the Equipment sphere with
      this knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc28"><span>Nautical Exploration</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar has learned how to construct a basic nautical apparatus
      that can be quickly assembled and disassembled for easy use. It takes the
      scholar 1 hour to assemble or disassemble the nautical apparatus, and it
      has a number of hit points equal to the scholar&#8217;s class level and
      hardness equal to twice her Intelligence bonus (minimum 2), and weighs a
      total of 40 lbs. The nautical apparatus is capable of transporting up to 2
      + the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus Medium creatures underwater with
      a swim speed of 60 ft., and contains enough air to allow up to the maximum
      number of passengers to breathe for 1 hour per class level. Small
      creatures take up half the space and air of a Medium creature, while Large
      creatures take up twice the amount of space and air.</p>

      <p>Scholars of 7th level or higher can treat the gadget with special
      materials, allowing it to be used safely in virtually any liquid,
      including harmful substances like acid or lava. Creatures inside the
      gadget are protected from the effects of exposure to such materials as
      long as they remain inside. Opening or sealing the nautical apparatus
      requires a move action. Only the scholar can pilot this gadget; if anyone
      else attempts to pilot it, it requires a DC 15 Intelligence or Profession
      (sailor) check each round; failure means the gadget does not move in a
      desired direction and instead sinks 10 ft., or the distance to the first
      surface capable of sustaining its weight, whichever is closer. In
      addition, the gadget takes 1 point of damage each round someone other than
      the scholar who created it attempts to pilot it due to the fragile nature
      of some of the control mechanisms.</p>

      <h4 id="toc29"><span>Poisoncraft</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar has trained and studied in the arts of preparing and
      handling poisons. The scholar never risks accidentally poisoning herself
      when applying poison to a weapon or trap, and may apply poison to a weapon
      or trap as a move action. If the scholar is at least 6th level, she also
      adds 1/2 her class level to the DC of any non-Alchemy sphere poison she
      prepares herself, and she may now apply poisons to her weapons and traps
      as a swift action.</p>

      <h4 id="toc30"><span>Rapid Alchemy</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar&#8217;s research has taught her speedy and efficient
      techniques for creating various alchemical items. The scholar may craft
      any single alchemical item worth 150 gp or less (such as a vial of
      alchemist&#8217;s fire, smokestick, or tanglefoot bag) in half an hour;
      she must still succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check and pay all material
      costs as normal. The scholar cannot decrease this time any further by
      increasing the Craft DC. If the scholar knows the formulae for an improved
      version of an alchemical item worth 150 gp or less (such as the improved
      alchemist&#8217;s fire formulae) she reduces the crafting time to 15
      minutes instead of half an hour. In addition, the scholar adds her
      Intelligence modifier to the DC of any alchemical item she crafts herself
      (this does not include improved alchemical items made with the Alchemy
      sphere).</p>

      <h4 id="toc31"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Ritual Crafter
      [CS]</span></span></h4>

      <p>The scholar gains the Craft Rituals feat even if she does not qualify
      for it and may use her class level in place of her caster level when
      researching rituals. The scholar may research rituals even if she does not
      possess the required spheres. This stacks normally with caster levels
      gained from other sources. The scholar must have the ritual student knack
      to select this knack.</p>

      <h4 id="toc32"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Ritual Student
      [CS]</span></span></h4>

      <p>The scholar gains the Ritual Caster feat even if she does not qualify
      for it and may use her class level in place of her caster level when
      performing rituals. This stacks normally with caster levels gained from
      other sources. In settings where rituals are tied to specific traditions,
      the scholar chooses a number of traditions equal to her practitioner
      modifier and counts as possessing those traditions for the purposes of
      performing rituals.</p>

      <h4 id="toc33"><span>Studied Technique</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar formulates and masters a unique combat style or technique
      she can use to defeat her foes. Each time the scholar takes this knack,
      she gains three bonus talents; these bonus talents may be spent on any
      talent she qualifies for, or to gain one or more new base combat spheres.
      The scholar may take this knack up to a total of three times.</p>

      <h4 id="toc34"><span>Survival Training</span></h4>

      <p>The scholar may move through any sort of nonmagical undergrowth (such
      as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her
      normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
      If the scholar is at least 6th level, this extends to areas of thorns and
      other natural impediments that have been magically manipulated to impede
      motion. In addition, the scholar leaves no trail in natural surroundings
      and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>

      <h4 id="toc35"><span>Trick Arrows</span></h4>

      <p>Scholars with this knack learn how to affix their flashbangs to bolts
      or arrowheads. As part of an attack action made with a ranged weapon, the
      scholar can affix a flashbang to her weapon, causing any creature struck
      by it to be treated as though it had also been struck by one of the
      scholar&#8217;s flashbangs. Flashbangs whose effects would affect an area
      larger than a single target treat the target of the scholar&#8217;s attack
      as the center of their effect.</p>
