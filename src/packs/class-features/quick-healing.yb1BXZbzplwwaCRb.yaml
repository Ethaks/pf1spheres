    value: >
      <p>As a free action once per round, the shifter may heal 5 hit points as
      if she had the fast healing ability. She may heal 5 hit points per day in
      this manner for every 2 shifter levels possessed. If she falls unconscious
      because of hit point damage and she still has healing from this ability,
      the ability activates automatically each round until she is conscious
      again or the ability is depleted for the day.</p>

      <p>This bestial trait can be gained multiple times. Each time it is
      gained, increased the maximum hit points that can be healed with this
      ability by an additional 5 per 2 shifter levels.</p>
