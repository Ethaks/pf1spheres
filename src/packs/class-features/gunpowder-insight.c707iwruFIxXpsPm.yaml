      <p>The technician gains proficiency with all firearms (except siege
      weapons) and gains the Gunsmithing feat. If the technician already
      possesses these abilities via feats or martial talents, he may immediately
      retrain them.</p>

      <p>In addition, the technician may make the following gadget:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Firework:</strong> This gadget flies in a specific direction
      and loudly explodes in a color of the technician&#8217;s choice. A
      firework is considered a splash weapon, but with a range increment of 100
      ft. The firework deals 1d6 fire damage per 2 technician levels on a direct
      hit, and the target must pass a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round.
      On a successful save, the target is still dazzled for 1 round. Creatures
      within 5 ft. of the target square suffer splash damage equal to the
      firework&#8217;s minimum damage and are dazzled for 1 round.</li>

      </ul>
