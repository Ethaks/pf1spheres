    value: >
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, an armorist learns to be more maneuverable while
      wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, she reduces the armor check
      penalty by 1 (minimum 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed
      by her armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, and
      19th) these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum &#8211;5 reduction of the
      armor check penalty and a +5 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus
      allowed.</p>

      <p>In addition, an armorist can also move at her normal speed while
      wearing medium armor. At 7th level, an armorist can move at her normal
      speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>
