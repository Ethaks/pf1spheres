      <p>At 2nd level, you may lay on hands as a paladin. Each day, you can use
      this ability a number of times equal to 1/2 your incanter level plus your
      casting ability modifier. With one use of this ability, you can heal 1d6
      hit points of damage for every two incanter levels you possess. Using this
      ability is a standard action, or a swift action if you are healing
      yourself. You must have one hand free to use this ability. This is a
      positive energy effect.</p>

      <p>You can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures,
      dealing damage equal to the damage you could have healed. Using lay on
      hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw
      against this damage.</p>

      <p>You do not gain the paladin&#8217;s mercies, but qualify for feats and
      abilities that require the lay on hands ability.</p>
