      <p><strong>Death By A Thousand Cuts (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level,
      a conscript&#8217;s attacks slowly sap away his foe&#8217;s strength.
      Whenever the conscript deals bleed damage to a creature, it must make a
      Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the amount of bleed damage the target is
      suffering due to talents from the Duelist sphere (treat bleed damage in
      form of dice as their minimum roll)) or become fatigued; creatures who are
      already fatigued become exhausted, and exhausted creatures who fail their
      save lose consciousness and fall asleep.</p>

      <p>Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding (but not taking
      bleed damage) awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
      Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid
      another action). Creatures immune to bleed are immune to all other effects
      of this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Blooded Riposte (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, whenever a
      creature currently taking bleed damage successfully deals damage to a
      conscript with a melee attack, the conscript may make an attack action to
      disarm that creature as an immediate action.</p>

      <p><strong>Exsanguinating Strikes (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the bleed
      damage granted by blooded strike increases to 1d6 + 1d6 per 3 points of
      base attack bonus he possesses. In addition, the conscript&#8217;s attacks
      now ignore immunity to bleed damage; even if the target is not a creature
      with blood or capable of bleeding, his penetrating blows still sap
      whatever force animates the target creature.</p>
