      <p>At 3rd level, the warden no longer requires having his martial focus
      when using his patrol ability of the Guardian sphere. Additionally, when
      the warden would use his patrol ability while he has martial focus, he may
      treat his warden level as his base attack bonus for the purposes of the
      increased threatened area.</p>
