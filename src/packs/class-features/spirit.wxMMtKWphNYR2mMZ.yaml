      <p>A warden of spirit is a fierce individual of passion and heart,
      typically with an incredible connection to nature itself. These wardens
      command the essence of nature around them, calling brilliant flame and
      chilling currents to their allies&#8217; aid.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Nature</p>

      <p><strong>Natural Guard:</strong> A spiritual warden&#8217;s guard is
      made up of spirits of nature, wood and leaves. At 3rd level, the
      warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a bonus to their CMD equal to the
      warden&#8217;s guard bonus. Additionally, whenever the warden would use
      one of his (spirit) Nature abilities, he may instead grant one of his
      guarded allies the benefits of the (spirit) talent, instead of
      himself.</p>

      <p><strong>Spiritual Invigoration:</strong> At 7th level, the warden and
      allies (guarded or not) adjacent to him can use a swift action to grant
      themselves a number of temporary hit points equal to half the
      warden&#8217;s level (minimum 1). These temporary hit points last for 1
      minute. If the warden has a patrol active when an ally uses this ability,
      or the ally is his guarded ally, they instead gain a number of temporary
      hit points equal to 1/2 his class level plus his casting ability modifier
      (minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Primal Bulwark:</strong> At 11th level, when using his guard
      ability, the warden may spend a spell point to grant an additional effect
      depending on the Nature packages he possesses. If the warden possesses
      multiple Nature packages, he may only choose a single package as part of
      using this ability.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Air:</strong> The target gains a fly speed (average) equal to
      the guarded allies&#8217; base land speed.</li>

      <li><strong>Earth:</strong> The target gains light fortification (25%
      chance to negate a critical hit or precision damage).</li>

      <li><strong>Fire:</strong> Whenever the target would suffer damage from a
      melee attack, the attacker must succeed a Reflex save or suffer an amount
      of fire damage equal to the maximum fire size the warden can affect.</li>

      <li><strong>Metal:</strong> Whenever the target would be dealt
      bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, they may use an immediate action
      or expend an attack of opportunity to reduce the damage dealt by an amount
      equal to the warden&#8217;s level.</li>

      <li><strong>Plant:</strong> Whenever the target would be attacked by a
      manufactured melee weapon, they may use an immediate action to make a free
      disarm attempt against the attacker, with the CMB for this check being
      equal to the warden&#8217;s class level + his casting ability
      modifier.</li>

      <li><strong>Water:</strong> The target gains a swim speed equal to their
      base land speed. Additionally, whenever they would be dealt fire or acid
      damage, they may use an immediate action or expend an attack of
      opportunity to reduce the damage dealt by 2d6 + the warden&#8217;s casting
      ability modifier.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Sentinel of the Ancients:</strong> At 15th level, whenever the
      warden would use his patrol ability, he may spend a spell point to infuse
      his area of patrol with ancient spirits of nature. All allies within the
      warden&#8217;s area of patrol gain a specific benefit depending on the
      Nature packages he possesses. If the warden possesses or is counted as
      possessing multiple Nature packages, he must choose a single package as
      part of using this ability.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Air:</strong> Affected allies gain a +4 bonus to AC against
      ranged attacks, and a +10 foot enhancement bonus to all movement speeds
      they possess.</li>

      <li><strong>Earth:</strong> Affected allies gain a +2 bonus to CMD against
      trip and bull rush attempts, and gain acid resistance 5. This resistance
      stacks with similar sources.</li>

      <li><strong>Fire:</strong> Affected allies reduce all bleed damage
      suffered by 2, and gain fire resistance 5. This resistance stacks with
      similar sources.</li>

      <li><strong>Metal:</strong> Affected allies gain DR 5/adamantine. This DR
      stacks with similar sources.</li>

      <li><strong>Plant:</strong> Affected allies gain a +2 natural armor bonus
      to AC.</li>

      <li><strong>Water:</strong> Affected allies gain a +4 bonus to CMB checks
      made to break a grapple, and gains cold resistance 5. This resistance
      stacks with similar sources.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>This lasts until the end of his next turn. If the warden would
      reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he can keep
      extending the duration of the ability by one additional round without
      spending a spell point. He may choose a different package to use when
      reactivating his patrol.</p>

      <p><strong>Guardian of Nature:</strong> At 19th level, the warden can call
      forth a guardian of nature. This functions as the Zoetic Geomancy advanced
      nature talent, except he can spend 10 additional minutes and 1 additional
      spell point to apply the advanced template to the summoned creature. This
      guardian of nature lasts for 1 minute per warden level.</p>

      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc78"><span>Improved Primal Bulwark (requires spirit, warden
      14)</span></h4>

      <p>Whenever the warden would use his primal bulwark vigil ability, he may
      spend an additional spell point to enhance his primal bulwark, granting
      greater effects.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Air:</strong> The granted fly speed is doubled, and becomes
      (perfect) maneuverability.</li>

      <li><strong>Earth:</strong> The granted fortification increases to medium
      fortification (50% chance to negate a critical hit or precision
      damage)</li>

      <li><strong>Fire:</strong> The granted fire resistance increases to fire
      resistance 15.</li>

      <li><strong>Metal:</strong> The target also gains DR/adamantine equal to
      the warden&#8217;s casting ability modifier (minimum 1).</li>

      <li><strong>Plant:</strong> Whenever the target would be attacked, they
      may use an immediate action to make a free grapple attempt against the
      attacker, with the CMB for this check being equal to the warden&#8217;s
      class level + his casting ability modifier.</li>

      <li><strong>Water:</strong> The granted cold resistance increases to cold
      resistance 15.</li>

      </ul>

      <h4 id="toc79"><span>Rooted Guard (requires spirit)</span></h4>

      <p>The warden&#8217;s guarded allies double the bonus to their CMD granted
      by guard against bull rush, overrun, reposition, and trip attempts.</p>
