      <p>Starting at 4th level, the shifter&#8217;s magic begins to augment her
      natural attacks, in both her normal and transformed shapes. All the
      shifter&#8217;s natural attacks are treated as magic weapons for the
      purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level they are treated as
      cold iron and silver weapons. At 10th level, the shifter has come to
      embody fluidity so much that her natural attacks are treated as chaotic
      weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level,
      they are treated as adamantine weapons for this purpose.</p>
