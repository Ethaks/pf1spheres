      <p>When the armorist creates a bound weapon they may allow that bound
      weapon to also function as an implement. The bound weapon grants its
      enhancement bonus to one sphere while wielded (chosen when the bound
      equipment is created) as well as to attack and damage rolls, and the bound
      weapon can be given implement special abilities, although its combined
      enhancement and weapon/implement special abilities still cannot exceed its
      total bonus as a bound weapon.</p>
