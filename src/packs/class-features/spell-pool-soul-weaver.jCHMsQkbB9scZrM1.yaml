      <p>A soul weaver gains a small reservoir of energy she can call on to
      create truly wondrous effects, called a spell pool. This pool contains a
      number of spell points equal to her class level + her casting ability
      modifier (minimum 1). This pool replenishes once per day after roughly 8
      hours of rest.</p>
