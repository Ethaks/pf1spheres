    value: >
      <p>The mageknight can treat any armor she wears as having the collapsible
      special ability, except that she may collapse or recall the armor as a
      swift action instead of a full-round action, and she may choose which
      piece the armor collapses into each time she uses this ability. This
      allows the mageknight to wear multiple suits of armor and allows her to
      collapse one and recall another as part of the same action, though it does
      not allow her to benefit from more than one suit at a time. She may spend
      a spell point to collapse or recall her armor as a free action instead of
      a swift action.</p>
