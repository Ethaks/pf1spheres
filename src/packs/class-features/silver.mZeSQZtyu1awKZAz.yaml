      <p>Silver is the metal most closely related to the moon and is said to
      ward off bad luck and witchcraft. When the scholar first gains this
      imposition she learns how to craft a small amulet that must use at least
      10 sp worth of silver and costs 1 hour and a total of 100 gp times the
      scholar&#8217;s class level to create. A silver amulet crafted in this
      manner may be sold for 1/2 its crafting cost, as long as it is currently
      functioning. As long as the scholar or an ally is wearing this amulet,
      they gain spell resistance equal to 10 + the scholar&#8217;s class level.
      These charms do not occupy an item slot, but wearing more than one has no
      additional effect. Because they are not true magic items but rather
      science and geometry applied in a way that interferes with magical
      energies, these amulets are exceedingly fragile, and they cease to
      function after they have forced casters to attempt a caster level check to
      overcome the granted spell resistance a number of times equal to the
      scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), as determined at the
      time the amulet was crafted. Once this limit has been reached, the amulet
      ceases to function until the scholar spends at least 1 hour re-attuning
      it. As an immediate action, the scholar may expend their martial focus to
      quickly realign the amulet, causing a caster level check to not consume
      one of its uses.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Dispelling Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar adds
      a mixture of silver, salt, lead, and other materials which naturally
      disrupt magical energies to her flashbangs. Creatures and objects that
      fail their save against the flashbang&#8217;s initial effect are also
      subject to a targeted dispel magic spell, using the scholar&#8217;s level
      as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell
      effect. If the scholar also possesses the circle of salt material
      imposition, this instead acts as a targeted greater dispel magic
      effect.</li>
