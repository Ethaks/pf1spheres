    value: >
      <p>Whenever the sage deals damage to an opponent using his chi gong
      ability, he may spend a ki point to twine his ki throughout his
      opponent&#8217;s body, hindering their movement and slowing their
      reactions. The opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save or take a penalty
      to their Reflex saving throws and attack rolls made as part of an attack
      of opportunity equal to the number of chi gong dice the sage possesses (so
      a 5th level sage would inflict a -3 penalty) until the end of the
      sage&#8217;s next turn; multiple uses of this ability do not stack.</p>
