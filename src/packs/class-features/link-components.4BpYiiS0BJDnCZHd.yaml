      <p>Successfully performing a link component increases the length of the
      prodigy&#8217;s active sequence by 1 link. A given action may not add more
      than 1 link even if it fulfills the conditions of more than one link
      component, such as dealing damage to a hostile creature and that hostile
      creature failing a save granted by that same effect. Bonus attacks granted
      by or made as part of a given action (such as the Barrage or Dual Wielding
      spheres or the Armiger&#8217;s rapid assault ability) count as part of the
      original action for this purpose, though attacks of opportunity do not.
      All openers function as link components if performed after a sequence has
      been started. No link component may grant a link more than once per turn.
      The following are your basic link components:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Abandon Focus:</strong> As a free action, the prodigy may
      expend martial focus.</li>

      <li><strong>Adopt Form: [Youxia HB]</strong> Expend martial focus as part
      of activating a (stance) talent.</li>

      <li><strong>Close the Gap:</strong> As a move action, the prodigy may move
      up to her speed, ending the movement with a hostile creature within her
      threatened area. She may sheath one weapon and draw another as a free
      action as part of this movement.</li>

      <li><strong>Counting Coup:</strong> As a swift action, a prodigy may make
      a touch attack against a creature using a wielded weapon. If successful,
      this attack deals no damage but completes this (link). Weapons that
      require ammunition expend one attack&#8217;s worth of ammunition when used
      with this ability. Such an attack is too glancing to deliver a held touch
      spell, trigger ammunition properties that function on hit, utilize a
      thrown splash weapon, or similar effects.</li>

      <li><strong>Disengage:</strong> As a move action, the prodigy may move up
      to half her speed. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity for leaving
      her starting squares. She may sheath one weapon and draw another as a free
      action as part of this movement.</li>

      <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Whenever the prodigy would be granted an
      attack of opportunity against a hostile creature, she may choose to expend
      an attack of opportunity without making an attack to complete this (link).
      She must be capable of making the attack to use this ability.</li>

      <li><strong>Save:</strong> Succeed on a save against a non-harmless effect
      originating from a hostile creature.</li>

      <li><strong>Swift Heal:</strong> Restore hit points to an ally or remove
      ability drain, ability damage, or the blinded, dazed, frightened,
      nauseated, shaken, sickened, or stunned conditions with an ability that
      requires at least an immediate action.</li>

      <li><strong>Steel Mind:</strong> Pass a concentration check to maintain
      concentration on a sphere effect when taking damage.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Some abilities, such as possessing certain spheres, may grant
      additional link component options. Such options have the (link) tag.</p>
