      <p>At 1st level, an armiger may customize up to three sets of weapons in a
      process that takes 8 hours of modification, drilling, and practice each,
      reworking scabbards, modifying grips, adding hooks and straps, and other
      tweaks to suit her personal fighting style. Each set may consist of: a
      single weapon, a pair of weapons that are wielded simultaneously, up to 10
      identical thrown weapons, or up to 50 pieces of ammunition. A given weapon
      cannot be part of more than one set simultaneously. The armiger always
      treats her active weapon as if it were masterwork.</p>

      <p>The armiger may choose to customize a new weapon by spending 8 hours,
      choosing which existing customizations to lose. The armiger must be
      proficient with the weapon to customize it and may not customize siege
      weapons. If the armiger possesses proficiency with shields, she may
      customize a shield with one of her weapon customization sets, either as a
      single weapon or as part of a pair of weapons. The enhancement bonus from
      enhanced customization only applies to using the shield as a weapon.</p>

      <p>The customization process allows the armiger to train in additional
      talents unique to each customized weapon. At first level, each customized
      weapon grants a single sphere or talent. A customized weapon must possess
      a base sphere before additional talents of that sphere may be added unless
      the armiger possesses that sphere, such as through the bonus talents
      gained from possessing the combat training class feature, from the Extra
      Combat Talent feat, or levels in another class. The armiger may not use
      talents gained from a customized weapon to qualify for feats or to meet
      other prerequisites unless otherwise noted. Customization talents may be
      changed with the same action required to customize a new weapon. Spheres
      and talents that grant skill retraining never grant it when gained via a
      customized weapon.</p>

      <p>The armiger may only benefit from the talents granted by one customized
      weapon at a time. The weapon she is currently gaining talents from is the
      active weapon. A customized weapon may be activated as part of drawing it
      or otherwise recovering it (such as picking it up from the ground) with no
      action cost. The active weapon must be wielded (or able to be drawn, in
      the case of ammunition) to provide its benefits; should the active weapon
      be disarmed, stowed, destroyed, or otherwise no longer wielded (or able to
      be drawn, in the case of ammunition), the armiger loses access to the
      granted talents immediately.</p>

      <p>If the weapon is thrown as part of an attack, the armiger retains any
      benefits from the weapon until the end of her turn.</p>

      <p>If the armiger customizes a set of thrown weapons or ammunition, she
      retains the granted talents as long as at least one of the set remains
      wielded. If a pair of weapons are customized to be wielded together and
      one is not being wielded, the armiger loses the benefits of the granted
      talents until the second weapon is recovered. Should the armiger be
      wielding weapons from two separate customization sets at the same time,
      she may choose which weapon is active at the beginning of each turn.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, etc.),
      each customized weapon grants an additional talent. The armiger gains an
      additional customized weapon at her 11th and 19th levels.</p>

      <h4 id="toc3"><span>Customized Weapons and Drawbacks</span></h4>

      <p>If the armiger possesses a sphere-specific drawback, she may use a
      talent granted by a customized weapon to buy off that drawback. if the
      armiger gains a base sphere from a customized weapon, with the GM's
      permission she may apply a drawback to that sphere to gain a bonus talent
      as normal for a drawback. The drawback and bonus talent must be set at the
      time the weapon is customized. Such a drawback may be bought off when that
      weapon grants an additional talent.</p>
