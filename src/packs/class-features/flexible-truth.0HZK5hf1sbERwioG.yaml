      <p>At 3rd level, the troubadour has become so adept at living multiple
      &#8216;truths&#8217; through his personas that he can make himself
      temporarily believe anything, making it possible for him to fool
      truth-detecting magic or magic that detects his thoughts. A creature using
      this sort of magic against the troubadour must succeed on a caster level
      check (MSB check) against a DC of 15 + 1/2 the troubadour&#8217;s class
      level to succeed; failure means the magic doesn&#8217;t detect the
      troubadour&#8217;s lies or force him to speak only the truth, and if the
      magic is reading his mind, this lets the troubadour choose what thoughts
      to display. If the troubadour possesses a similar ability (such as through
      skill unlocks), only use the higher DC; do not roll the check twice.</p>

      <p>This ability does not protect against mental attacks or mind-reading
      that delves deeper than surface thoughts.</p>
