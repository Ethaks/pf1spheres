      <p>The striker adds the following conditions she can ignore with her iron
      soul striker art, although she must spend 1 additional tension when
      ignoring the following conditions: dazed, exhausted, frightened,
      nauseated, paralyzed, or stunned (if a condition would cause the striker
      to be unable to act, as long as she can take purely mental actions, she
      can use this striker art).</p>
