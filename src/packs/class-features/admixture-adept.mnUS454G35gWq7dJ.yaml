      <p>The incanter gains the Admixture talent as a bonus magic talent. He
      also gains an admixture pool as an admixture savant (see elementalist
      archetypes in chapter 4) of half his incanter level (minimum 1). These
      levels stack with admixture savant levels for determining the size of his
      admixture pool.</p>
