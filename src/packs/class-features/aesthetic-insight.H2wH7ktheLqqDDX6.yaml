      <p>The technician knows how to create inventions that are user-friendly,
      balanced, and sleek. Other creatures suffer only half the usual penalty
      when attempting to use one of his inventions. If attempting to pilot an
      independent invention, the piloting DC increases by +2 per improvement
      rather than +4.</p>
