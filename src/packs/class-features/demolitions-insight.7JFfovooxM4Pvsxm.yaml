    value: >
      <p>The technician&#8217;s detonators deal full damage to objects rather
      than half, and deals an additional 3 damage per technician level to
      unattended objects, walls, and terrain.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the technician may choose to give his detonator a cone
      area of effect rather than a burst area of effect. Rather than affecting
      all squares within 5 ft., it affects everything in a 15 ft. cone. He may
      choose which direction this cone extends when holding or placing the
      detonator, and if the detonator destroys a wall or piece of terrain, it
      can affect creatures on the other side of the blast. If combined with a
      benefit from Chemical Insight, the cone&#8217;s size becomes 3x the
      effect&#8217;s radius.</p>
