      <p>Fey adepts gain a limited ability to wield shadowstuff&#8212;the pure
      essence of shadows. With this power, the fey adept can affect the world
      around him with his illusions by weaving reality into the images.</p>

      <p>The fey adept gains a pool of shadow points equal to his Charisma
      modifier + 1/2 his fey adept level (minimum 1) that refills when the fey
      adept regains all of their spell points. A fey adept may spend shadow
      points to create any of the following effects.</p>

      <h3 id="toc8"><span>Shadowmark</span></h3>

      <p>The fey adept may spend a shadow point to hurl pure shadowstuff at a
      target within your illusion range, weakening its body and making its mind
      more susceptible to the fey adept&#8217;s magic. This requires a ranged
      touch attack. If successful, the target takes 1d6 damage and suffers a -1
      penalty to Will saves against all the fey adept&#8217;s sphere abilities
      for 1 minute. This damage improves by 1d6 for every odd level the fey
      adept possesses, to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level. The Will penalty
      increases to -2 at 7th level, -3 at 13th level, and -4 at 19th level. This
      penalty does not stack with itself. This is considered an illusion
      (figment, shadow) effect from the Illusion sphere.</p>

      <h3 id="toc9"><span>Create Reality</span></h3>

      <p>At 6th level, the fey adept may spend shadow points in conjunction with
      creating an illusion with the Illusion sphere to weave reality into the
      illusion. This grants the illusion the [shadow] descriptor.</p>

      <p>This follows all the usual rules for creating and maintaining
      illusions, except the illusion gains an additional benefit depending on
      what illusion is created. Many of these benefits improve at 12th and 18th
      levels. Illusions still must possess the appropriate (sensory) talents to
      be believed. When using an illusion to mimic an effect from another sphere
      the effect still counts as an Illusion sphere effect (such as when
      calculating caster level) and does not count as the alternate sphere for
      other purposes, such as when applying talents or feats based on those
      spheres.</p>

      <p>In order to create reality, the fey adept must spend spell points as
      usual to create the illusion, plus 1 shadow point + 1 per spell point that
      would be required by the mimicked effect in question. This includes spell
      point costs to maintain an effect without concentration (thus, to create a
      shadow companion that persists without concentration would cost two spell
      points to create a self-sustained illusion as well as 3 shadow
      points).</p>

      <h4 id="toc10"><span>Companion</span></h4>

      <p>The fey adept may create an illusionary creature that may interact with
      the world around it. This creates the equivalent of a companion from the
      Conjuration sphere, except it only possesses 1/5th a companion&#8217;s
      usual hit points. Targets who interact with the illusionary creature are
      allowed a Will saving throw to disbelieve as usual. Targets who disbelieve
      the illusionary creature receive only half damage from the creature.</p>

      <p>An illusionary companion possesses one (form) talent as is usual for
      companions, and gains an additional (form) talent at 12th level and 18th
      level.</p>

      <h4 id="toc11"><span>Destructive Blast</span></h4>

      <p>The fey adept may give substance to an instantaneous effect such as a
      burst of fire, a bolt of lightning, or another simulated effect. This
      creates a destructive blast as the Destruction sphere, which may possess
      any (blast type) talent and (blast shape) talent of the fey adept&#8217;s
      choosing. An instantaneous destructive blast cannot be extended through
      concentration or spell points as is usual with illusions, but a
      destructive blast with a duration (such as Energy Wall or Energy Sphere)
      persists as long as the illusion is maintained, to a maximum of 1 round
      per caster level.</p>

      <p>Targets affected by an illusionary destructive blast who succeed at
      their Will save to disbelieve suffer only half damage and receive a +4
      bonus to any saving throw associated with the destructive blast
      itself.</p>

      <h4 id="toc12"><span>Glamer</span></h4>

      <p>If the fey adept can create a glamer, he may add substance to the
      glamer, making the change quasi-real. This grants the creature any one
      trait (except for traits that affect the mind such as Animal Mind, or
      traits that change the nature of the creature such as making it
      incorporeal) from the Alteration sphere in addition to the glamer
      itself.</p>

      <p>The glamer must depict the trait to be applied (for example, the glamer
      must include wings to grant the creature a fly speed). This stacks with
      shapeshifts applied with the Alteration sphere (as it is an illusion and
      not an actual shapeshift), but only one glamer may be applied to an
      individual creature at a time in this manner. Applying a second glamer
      with shadowstuff to a creature dispels the first glamer, provided they
      were created by the same caster, or the second caster succeeds at a magic
      skill check.</p>

      <p>A glamer created in this manner may grant up to two traits at 12th
      level, and up to three traits at 18th level.</p>

      <h4 id="toc13"><span>Nature</span></h4>

      <p>The fey adept may create an illusion of a natural effect, such as those
      created through the Nature sphere. This can recreate the effects of the
      Create Fire, Dust Storm, Entangle, Fog, or Vortex geomancing abilities.
      The area to be affected need not have the usual materials such as water,
      dust, or plantlife to create this illusion. If a target succeeds at their
      Will save to disbelieve, they take half damage from the effect if it deals
      damage and gain a +4 bonus to any saving throw made against the
      effect.</p>

      <h4 id="toc14"><span>Objects</span></h4>

      <p>The fey adept creates an object that has form, shape, and weight, as if
      creating an object with the Creation sphere, although it has a hardness of
      0, 3 hit points per inch, and weight as if it were made of wood regardless
      of what the material appears to be. The fey adept may only create an
      object in this fashion with a size equivalent to 1 Small object per caster
      level, although this increases to 2 Small objects per caster level at 12th
      level, and 3 Small objects per caster level at 18th level.</p>

      <p>Targets who succeed at their saving throw to disbelieve the illusion
      realize the object is shadowstuff and not the material it appears to be
      and suffer only half damage if the object is used to damage them (for
      example if the object was dropped on them from above).</p>

      <h4 id="toc15"><span>Weather</span></h4>

      <p>The fey adept may create the illusion of a weather effect such as rain,
      snow, wind, or even combined like in a storm. This creates a severity 4
      aridity/precipitation, ash, temperature (cold or heat), vog (with caster
      level 10 or higher), and/or wind effect (with the resulting storm, snow
      and other effects if applicable) within a radius of close centered within
      the fey adept&#8217;s illusion range. This cannot be used to calm the
      weather in an area, and has no effect in an area where the weather
      category to be affected already has a severity of 4 or higher.</p>

      <p>If a target succeeds at its Will save to disbelieve, it treats the
      weather as being 2 steps lesser in severity in regard to itself. This
      cannot reduce the weather&#8217;s severity lower than what it was before
      the fey adept created the illusion. He may create effects of severity
      level 5 at 12th level, and severity level 6 at 18th level.</p>
