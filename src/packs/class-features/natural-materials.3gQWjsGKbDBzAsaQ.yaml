      <p>The armorist may summon equipment or create bound equipment out of
      darkwood, darkleaf cloth, greenwood, or normal wood treated with the
      ironwood ritual.</p>

      <p>The armorist adds wild (+3) and green-touched (+1) to the special
      abilities she may add to her bound and summoned armor and shields, and
      wild fang (+1) to those she may add to bound and summoned weapons.</p>

      <p>The armorist may make a natural attack she possesses or her own unarmed
      strike into a bound weapon, granting it the bonuses associated with being
      a bound weapon. The armorist may use her boost equipment class feature on
      unarmored creatures or on natural weapons and unarmed strikes.</p>
