    value: >
      <p>The knight&#8217;s blade drinks in magic as it does life. Whenever the
      mageknight reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, she gains 2
      temporary spell points which last for 1 minute (see the Mana sphere for
      rules on temporary spell points). Creatures with fewer Hit Dice than half
      the mageknight&#8217;s character level do not grant temporary spell
      points.</p>

      <p>If the mageknight possesses the resist magic class feature, the bonus
      from her resist magic ability applies to all death and negative energy
      effects, even if they are not spells, spell-like abilities, or magic
      sphere effects.</p>
