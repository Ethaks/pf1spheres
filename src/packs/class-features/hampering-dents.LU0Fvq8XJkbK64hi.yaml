    value: >
      <p>Whenever the blacksmith successfully deals damage to a creature&#8217;s
      armor with the sunder combat maneuver or a similar ability while using the
      attack action, that creature takes a -1 penalty to Acrobatics, Climb, and
      Swim checks, as well as to all melee damage rolls. This penalty increases
      by an additional -1 for every 5 levels the blacksmith possesses. Restoring
      at least 1 hit point to the damaged armor removes this effect.</p>
