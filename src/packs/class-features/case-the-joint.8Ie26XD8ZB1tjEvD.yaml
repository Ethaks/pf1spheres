    value: >
      <p>The troubadour can use one persona to learn important facts about a
      location before returning later in another persona. If he spends at least
      1 hour in a location while in one persona that is considered welcome
      there, he can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) check. If he
      succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check
      involving the location&#8217;s layout (such as a Stealth check to sneak
      into the location, a Disable Device check to disable an alarm, or a
      Sleight of Hand check to snatch an object from a pedestal).</p>

      <p>For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the troubadour gains an
      additional reroll. If the troubadour fails to return to the location
      within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the
      rerolls. A troubadour can&#8217;t case the same joint more than once a
      week.</p>
