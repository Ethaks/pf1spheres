      <p>The scholar learns how to combine a small sample of a chosen element
      with other materials to grow a living elemental that they can keep in a
      small container, such as a bottle or potion vial. When this imposition is
      chosen, the scholar selects one of the following: air, earth, fire, or
      water.</p>

      <p>The scholar may grow a small elemental of this type during an 8 hour
      rest; at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, the scholar increases the size
      and power of the elemental she can grow in this way by 1 step (medium,
      large, huge, greater). The scholar may activate this imposition to release
      the elemental from the vial, allowing it to aid her on and off the
      battlefield. The elemental understands the scholar and follows her
      commands to the best of its ability. If the elemental moves more than 100
      ft. away from the scholar, it disperses 1d4 rounds later, regardless of
      whether or not it returns to the scholar&#8217;s side during that time.
      The scholar cannot have more than one elemental active with this ability
      at a time, and activating another imposition dismisses the elemental,
      causing it to return to its vial. As long as the elemental is not
      destroyed, banished, or dispersed, it can be reclaimed into its vial as a
      swift action. Elementals conjured in this way are treated as summoned
      creatures for spells and effects.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Elemental Enhancement [explosive]:</strong> As long as the
      scholar is adjacent to an active elemental from this imposition&#8217;s
      primary effect, she may use it to augment her flashbangs with elemental
      power, allowing them to deal damage of the type matching her elemental.
      Targets must make a Reflex save instead of the normal Fortitude save; in
      addition to the normal effects of the flashbang, the scholar deals an
      amount of additional damage of the chosen element type (air deals
      electricity damage, water deals cold damage, earth deals acid damage, and
      fire deals fire damage) equal to 1d6 per scholar level. Creatures who
      succeed on their Reflex save take 1/2 damage and are not subject to the
      flashbang&#8217;s normal effects.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> The scholar may choose this imposition more
      than once, selecting a different element each time.</p>
