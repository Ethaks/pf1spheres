    value: >
      <p>Whenever the sage would be struck by an attack, he may spend a ki point
      as an immediate action to create a protective barrier of ki, granting him
      a deflection bonus to his AC equal to twice the number of chi gong dice he
      possesses against that attack. The sage may also use this ability whenever
      he would need to make a Reflex saving throw against a spell or effect to
      add a bonus equal to the number of chi gong dice he possesses to his
      roll.</p>
