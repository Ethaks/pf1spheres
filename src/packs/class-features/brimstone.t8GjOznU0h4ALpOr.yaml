      <p>Brimstone, also known as sulfur, has effects that can ward off illness
      and disease when used in small and controlled amounts. The scholar may
      activate this imposition by snapping a small piece of brimstone in two and
      placing it in a vest pocket or pouch resting between the nose and heart of
      a target creature within reach, granting a +1 competence bonus to
      Fortitude saves, +1 per 5 class levels she possesses. This bonus lasts for
      a number of minutes equal to 1 + her Intelligence modifier. While a
      creature is benefiting from this imposition, any time a creature attempts
      a bite or swallow whole against them, that creature must succeed at a
      Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Sulfuric Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar may
      enhance her flashbangs with large doses of brimstone, causing them to
      smoke and burn. In addition to the flashbang&#8217;s normal effects, the
      target also takes 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 class levels the scholar
      possesses; creatures who succeed on their Fortitude save against the
      flashbang take 1/2 damage from this effect. In addition, noxious smoke
      fills a radius around the target equal to 5 ft. + 5 ft. per four class
      levels the scholar possesses, causing any creature that is in the smoke to
      make a Fortitude save against the flashbang&#8217;s original DC or be
      sickened for as long as they remain in the effect and for 1d4 rounds
      thereafter. The smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute, and is
      dispersed in 1 round by strong or stronger winds.</li>
