      <p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to gain the
      benefits of one teamwork feat. She must meet all the feat&#8217;s
      prerequisites. All of her allies are treated as if they possessed the same
      teamwork feat for the purpose of determining whether she receives a bonus
      from the teamwork feat acquired. Her allies do not receive any bonuses
      from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves.</p>

      <p>Her allies&#8217; positioning and actions must still meet the
      prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for her to receive the listed
      bonus. She keeps the feat for a number of minutes equal to her casting
      ability modifier, or until she spends another spell point to acquire
      another feat.</p>
