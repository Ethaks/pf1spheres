      <p><strong>Analytical Gaze (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a
      conscript uses his scout ability, he does not take a -5 penalty on the
      Perception check, and his successful use of the scout ability reveals any
      additional information which would be gained by making a successful
      Knowledge check. In addition, the conscript gains a +1 dodge bonus to his
      AC and Reflex saves against any attacks or abilities from a creature he
      has successfully scouted.</p>

      <p><strong>Stealth Surge (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, creatures the
      conscript has successfully scouted take a penalty on all Perception checks
      against him equal to 1/2 the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus. In
      addition, the first time the conscript attacks a scouted creature while it
      is unaware of his presence due to his use of Stealth or a similar ability,
      the conscript automatically treats the base damage dice for his weapon as
      though they had rolled the maximum amount.</p>

      <p><strong>Hidden Death (Ex):</strong> When the conscript reaches 20th
      level, the first time he attacks a scouted creature while it is unaware of
      his presence due to his use of Stealth or a similar ability, the creature
      must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the conscript&#8217;s base
      attack bonus + the ability modifier used for the triggering attack roll)
      or die. Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target is
      immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>
