      <p>You can throw your voice, making it appear to come from any space
      within 25 ft. +5 ft. per 2 levels. In addition, you may mimic almost any
      sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects. A target is allowed
      a Will saving throw (10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier) to
      detect something is wrong about the sound they are hearing, although
      success doesn&#8217;t mean they automatically know where it&#8217;s
      actually coming from. You must be at least 6th level to choose this
      talent.</p>
