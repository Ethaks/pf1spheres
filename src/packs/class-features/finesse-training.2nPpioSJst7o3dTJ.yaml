      <p>At 1st level, a conscript gains the Finesse Fighting Equipment talent
      (if he already has or gains Finesse Fighting or an equivalent feat from
      another source, he may select another combat talent for which he
      qualifies). In addition, starting at 4th level, he can select any one type
      of weapon that can be used with Finesse Fighting (such as rapiers or
      daggers). Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. Whenever he
      makes a successful melee attack with the selected weapon, he adds his
      Dexterity modifier instead of his Strength modifier to the damage roll. If
      any effect would prevent the conscript from adding his Strength modifier
      to the damage roll, he does not add his Dexterity modifier. The conscript
      can select a second weapon at 12th level and a third at 18th level.</p>
