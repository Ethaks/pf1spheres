      <p>Whenever the sage or an ally within reach would attempt a concentration
      check, he may spend a ki point as an immediate action to instill a
      temporary trance of utter calm, granting him or the ally a competence
      bonus to the concentration check equal to the number of chi gong dice he
      possesses.</p>

      <p>The sage may also use this ability whenever he would need to make a
      Will saving throw against a spell or effect to add a bonus equal to the
      number of chi gong dice he possesses to his roll.</p>
