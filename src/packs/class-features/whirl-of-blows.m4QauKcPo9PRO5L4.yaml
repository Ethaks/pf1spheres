      <p>The mageknight gains the Whirlwind Attack feat, even if she does not
      meet the prerequisites.</p>

      <h2 id="toc71"><span>Stalwart (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 3rd level, a mageknight can use mental and physical resiliency to
      avoid certain attacks. If she succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw
      against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she
      instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless mageknight does not gain
      the benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>

      <h2 id="toc72"><span>Marked (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At 7th level, a mageknight who successfully deals damage with a weapon
      or natural attack to a target may, as a swift action, leave a magical mark
      on that target. The target suffers a -2 penalty to saving throws against
      the spells, spelllike abilities, and sphere abilities of the mageknight,
      and the mageknight gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against the spells,
      spell-like abilities, and sphere abilities of the target. This mark lasts
      for 1 minute. The mageknight may not have more than 1 mark active at a
      time; giving a second mark causes the first to be dismissed.</p>

      <h2 id="toc73"><span>Mystic Defense (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At 11th level, a mageknight gains resistance to magical damage. This
      functions as damage reduction, except it only applies to damage sustained
      from spells, spell-like abilities, and sphere abilities. This only affects
      abilities that allow spell resistance. This damage reduction is equal to
      1/2 the mageknight&#8217;s class level. This does not apply to damage from
      magic weapons.</p>

      <h2 id="toc74"><span>Draw Power (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At 15th level, whenever the mageknight successfully confirms a critical
      hit, she gains 1 temporary spell point which lasts until the end of her
      next turn. This increases to 2 spell points with a x3 critical weapon, or
      3 spell points with an x4 critical weapon.</p>

      <h2 id="toc75"><span>Spell Critical (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At 19th level, whenever a mageknight successfully confirms a critical
      hit, she can use a sphere ability as an immediate action. The sphere
      ability must include the target of the attack as one of its targets or in
      its area of effect. Using this sphere ability does not provoke an attack
      of opportunity.</p>

      <h2 id="toc76"><span>Spellsword</span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level the mageknight may effortlessly combine magic and combat.
      Choose two mystic combat abilities that cost a spell point to use. She may
      use these abilities without spending a spell point.</p>
