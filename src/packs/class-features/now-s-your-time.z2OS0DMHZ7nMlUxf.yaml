      <p>As a standard action, the commander may expend martial focus to grant
      an ally affected by one of his shouts or tactics a single temporary hero
      point. This hero point is lost after 1 round if it is not expended. A
      single ally can only be affected by this enhanced tactic once per day.</p>
