      <p>The commander may use his move action to direct his allies to quickly
      change positions, allowing a number of allies equal to the greater of his
      Charisma or Intelligence modifiers (minimum 1) to immediately move up to
      10 ft. in any direction. An ally must be affected by one of the
      commander&#8217;s tactics to benefit from this ability, and must end the
      granted movement within the area of one of his tactics.</p>
