      <p>The hedgewitch can magically adjust her personal space in slight ways,
      allowing her to wear one additional magic item without it interfering with
      the other ones. She gains an untyped item slot that can hold any item of
      any slot, such as a second headband, a second pair of gloves, or third
      ring. This extra magic item can be stolen, sundered, or removed just like
      any other item.</p>
