      <p>You constantly benefit from any talents you gain from the Consumptive
      Intuition feat rather than only having them active for a limited duration
      per day. You may exchange which talents you have active whenever you rest
      to regain spell points or consume another brain. This does not allow you
      to benefit from more of these talents than you have instances of the
      Consumptive Intuition feat.</p>
