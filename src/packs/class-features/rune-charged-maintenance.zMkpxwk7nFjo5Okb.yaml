      <p>The blacksmith gains the ability to inscribe divine runewords and
      symbols onto equipment when performing maintenance, bestowing power to
      equipment. He learns two runes from the forgemaster<sup>ARG</sup>
      cleric&#8217;s runeforger ability, treating his blacksmith level as his
      cleric level when determining the effects of runes, and may choose to
      apply one rune as a maintenance. The duration of a rune applied as a
      maintenance is the same as a regular maintenance, lasting 24 hours or
      until their next 8 hour or longer rest, whichever comes first. The
      blacksmith must still meet any level prerequisites to apply a rune with
      maintenance. Unlike other maintenance options, runes are supernatural and
      are suppressed by antimagic fields or other similar effects, and may be
      removed by an erase spell or other similar effect. Equipment inscribed
      with runes by the blacksmith bear symbols of the blacksmith&#8217;s faith
      or ideology. At 8th level, the blacksmith can apply two runes as part of
      the same maintenance.</p>

      <p>The blacksmith may take this insight multiple times, each time learning
      two new runes.</p>
