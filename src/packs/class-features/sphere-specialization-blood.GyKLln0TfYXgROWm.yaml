      <strong>Red Minion (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter gains a Tiny
      blood construct as a permanent servant. As the incanter gains levels, he
      may choose to increase the size of the construct based on the following
      table, changeable when the incanter gains a level. The incanter may choose
      to advance the blood construct&#8217;s Hit Dice to that of an available
      size without actually increasing its size, if he so chooses.<br>

      <p>A slain blood construct may be replaced with an 8 hour ritual and
      sufficient blood to create a construct of that size (see the Extract Blood
      Construct talent).</p>

      <p><strong>Hemorrhagic Aura (Su):</strong> At 8th level, as a free action
      the incanter can emit a 30-foot aura that intensifies any bleed effects
      for one round. He may emit this aura for a total number of rounds per day
      equal to his incanter level. Hostile creatures within this area that are
      suffering from ongoing bleed effects must attempt a Fortitude save each
      round or suffer 1d2 points of Constitution damage that round. These rounds
      do not need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p><strong>Hemorrhagic Mastery (Su):</strong> At 20th level, any bleed
      damage the incanter deals is increased by 1/2 his incanter level. This
      bonus bleed damage is not increased by Empower Spell or similar effects.
      Additionally, whenever he uses blood control, he can roll twice to
      penetrate a creature&#8217;s spell resistance and take the better
      result.</p>
