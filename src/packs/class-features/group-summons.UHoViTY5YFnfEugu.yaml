      <p>The armorist may summon (or boost, if she is capable) multiple pieces
      of equipment at once, +1 per 2 armorist levels she possesses (minimum 1).
      The armorist may summon or boost multiple pieces of equipment on the same
      creature or onto multiple creatures, but the armorist must still be
      touching the creature or creatures to affect them. The armorist may grant
      different benefits to each summoned or boosted piece of equipment, but
      still spend a spell point for each summon or boost.</p>
