      <p>A warden of confidence is incredibly secure and confident, or at least,
      shows enough confidence to be inspirational to his allies. These wardens
      are more focused on themselves than most wardens, but always act as a
      source of inspiration and assurance for their allies, even if they do get
      in the way sometimes.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Gladiator</p>

      <p><strong>Confident Guard:</strong> A confident warden&#8217;s guard
      feels encouraging and incredible. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guarded
      allies gain a morale bonus to saving throws against fear and to the DC of
      any check to demoralize them equal to twice the warden&#8217;s guard
      bonus. Additionally, once per round, the warden may use boasts by
      expending an attack of opportunity instead of an immediate action when the
      boast would benefit his guarded ally.</p>

      <p><strong>Inspiring Audience:</strong> At 7th level, whenever the warden
      or one of his guarded allies would make an attack roll or be attacked, the
      warden may spend a spell point to allow any allies within 30 feet of them
      to spend an immediate action to grant them a +2 morale bonus to the attack
      roll or AC (to a maximum bonus of +6).</p>

      <p><strong>Grandiose Display:</strong> At 11th level, whenever the warden
      would use a boast, he may spend a spell point to apply one of the (boast)
      talents used as part of the boast to all of his guarded allies.</p>

      <p><em>Author's Note:</em> For the purposes of this ability, a benefit
      includes effects such as temporary hit points, damage reduction,
      additional saving throws, or other beneficial effects to the recipient. An
      effect that allows a recipient to instead "benefit" from additional
      hostile actions (such as the Bloodthirst (boast)) is not a benefit for the
      purposes of this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Inner Confidence:</strong> At 15th level, whenever the warden
      would guard himself (this does not include simply benefiting from his
      guard ability, like when using his self-sufficiency ability), he may spend
      a spell point to treat his guard bonus as being 1 higher when determining
      the benefits that he receives from his guard.</p>

      <p><strong>Complete Assurance:</strong> At 19th level, the warden may
      expend his martial focus or spend a spell point when using his patrol
      ability to grant all allies within his area of patrol immunity to hostile
      emotion and fear effects, in addition to increasing any morale bonus the
      ally is benefiting from by 2 until the end of his next turn. If the warden
      would reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he can keep
      extending the duration of this ability by one additional round without
      paying the associated costs.</p>

      <h3 id="toc48"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Vigil
      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc49"><span>Close to the Heart (requires confidence, Gladiator
      sphere) [AoP2]</span></h4>

      <p>The warden gains the Motivational Audience Gladiator talent as a bonus
      talent. If the ally that would perform an action that would allow the
      warden to boast is the warden&#8217;s guarded ally, the warden does not
      have to expend his martial focus when using the Motivational Audience
      talent.</p>

      <h4 id="toc50"><span>Share the Spotlight (requires confidence, Gladiator
      sphere, warden 4) [AoP2]</span></h4>

      <p>Whenever the warden would use a boast that would normally affect
      himself (and only himself), he may spend an attack of opportunity (in
      addition to the regular action cost of the boast) to instead have the
      boast affect an ally within his boast range, as if they were the one who
      used the boast (still using the warden&#8217;s statistics). If the chosen
      ally is his guarded ally, he does not need to spend the attack of
      opportunity as part of using this reinforcement.</p>
