      <p>Starting at 3rd level, a conscript may select a type of terrain from
      the ranger&#8217;s favored terrain list. The conscript gains a +2 bonus on
      initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and
      Survival skill checks when he is in this terrain. A conscript traveling
      through his favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked
      (though he may leave a trail if he so chooses).</p>

      <p>At 8th level and again at 16th level, the conscript may select an
      additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill
      bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one
      just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.</p>
