      <p>At 5th level, the prodigy may use her adaptation ability to gain the
      benefits of two talents at the same time. She may select one combat or
      magic talent as a move action or two combat or magic talents as a standard
      action. She may use one of these talents to meet a prerequisite of the
      second talent; doing so means that she cannot replace a talent currently
      fulfilling another&#8217;s prerequisite without also replacing those
      talents that require it. Each individual talent selected counts toward the
      prodigy&#8217;s daily uses of adaptation.</p>
