      <p>At 11th level, when the thaumaturge suffers backlash from using
      forbidden lore, he may use an invocation to empower himself. He gains a
      bonus to attack rolls, saving throws, and a dodge bonus to AC equal to his
      forbidden lore bonus for a number of rounds equal to his casting ability
      modifier. This does not negate the penalty gained through the backlash
      itself.</p>
