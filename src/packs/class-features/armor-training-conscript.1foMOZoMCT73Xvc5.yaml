    value: >
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, the conscript learns to be more maneuverable
      while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, the conscript reduces
      the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum
      Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. At 6th level and every four
      levels thereafter (10th, 14th, and 18th), these bonuses increase by +1
      each time, to a maximum &#8211;5 reduction of the armor check penalty and
      a +5 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>

      <p>In addition, he can also move at his normal speed while wearing medium
      armor. At 8th level, he can move at his normal speed while wearing heavy
      armor.</p>
