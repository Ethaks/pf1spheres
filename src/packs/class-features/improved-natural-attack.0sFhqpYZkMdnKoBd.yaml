      <p>One of the shifter&#8217;s natural attacks increases its damage by one
      die size. If the shifter loses that natural attack due to a shapeshift,
      she may designate a different natural attack for this to augment for the
      duration. The shifter may select this trait multiple times. A single
      natural attack cannot be improved more than once. Each time this trait is
      gained, increase the number of natural attacks that may be augmented at
      one time by 1.</p>
