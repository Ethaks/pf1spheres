      <p>The armiger may allow her cohorts to use her customized weapons. When
      the cohort wields the weapon, it may benefit from the talents granted by
      that weapon, though must still meet any prerequisites for any granted
      talent. The cohort also treats the weapon as masterwork and gains the
      benefits of enhanced customization for that weapon. Each cohort requires
      one hour of training with a customized weapon and may only be trained with
      one at a time.</p>
