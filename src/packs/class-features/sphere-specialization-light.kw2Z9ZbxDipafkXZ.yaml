      <p><strong>Lighteyes (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter gains
      Perception as a class skill and he gains an insight bonus equal to 1/2 his
      incanter level on all Perception checks. This bonus increases to being
      equal to his incanter level when detecting invisible or incorporeal
      creatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Disappearance (Sp):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter may
      bend light around himself, giving himself the invisible condition as a
      swift action. The incanter may use this ability for a total number of
      rounds per day equal to his incanter level, and these rounds do not need
      to be consecutive. Ending this invisibility is a free action.</p>

      <p><strong>See All:</strong> At 20th level, the incanter can see perfectly
      in darkness of any kind, even magical darkness that normally impedes
      darkvision. The target may see all invisible and ethereal creatures as if
      they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as
      translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between
      visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.</p>
