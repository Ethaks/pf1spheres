      <p><strong>Home in the Dark (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter
      gains blindsense 10 feet when within an area of dim light or darkness.
      This bonus increases by 5 feet per 5 incanter levels he possesses, to a
      maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.</p>

      <p><strong>Shadow Step (Sp):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter can use
      this ability to walk through the Plane of Shadow and reappear as a
      standard action. He can travel up to 30 feet per incanter level per day in
      this fashion, either in a single round or broken up across multiple shadow
      steps. This movement must be used in 5 feet increments and does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is
      imprecise; when he arrives, he re-enters 1 square off target, as per the
      rules for thrown splash weapons. If this would place him in an occupied
      square, he instead arrives in the nearest safe location. When he arrives,
      he is cloaked in shadow and gain concealment for 1 round. He may bring
      other willing creatures with him, but he must expend an equal amount of
      distance for each additional creature brought with him. They likewise
      re-enter off target (roll location for each creature) and are cloaked in
      shadow for 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Shadow Renewal:</strong> At 20th level, the incanter gains fast
      healing 5 while in dim light or darkness. This fast healing is suppressed
      while in any level of illumination brighter than dim light.</p>
