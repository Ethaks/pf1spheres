      <p>At 1st level, the crimson dancer's body is conditioned against the
      manipulation or shedding of blood; rarely bleeding, even when severely
      wounded. As long as the crimson dancer has at least 1 vitae, whenever she
      would suffer hit point damage due to a bleed of any type, she reduces the
      damage it would deal to 0 and instead loses one point of vitae.</p>

      <p>If the crimson dancer would ever suffer blood loss (willing or not) due
      to a (blood art) talent, she may spend any amount of vitae as an immediate
      action (or as a free action that can be taken outside of her turn if she
      was willing) to reduce the damage from the blood loss by 3 per point of
      vitae spent. She is still considered to have taken the full amount of
      blood loss for any effects that rely on the amount of blood loss she
      takes.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the crimson dancer gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws,
      skill checks, and ability checks made against effects produced by the
      Blood or Duelist sphere. This bonus also applies to the crimson
      dancer&#8217;s CMD whenever she would be subject to a Blood or Duelist
      sphere effect. Autocautery&#8217;s bonus increases by +1 at 4th level and
      every 4 levels thereafter.</p>

      <p>At 14th level, crimson&#8217;s dancer vitae storage eventually becomes
      such an integral part of her body that her mortal heart barely functions.
      The crimson dancer becomes immune to all poisons, diseases and bleed
      effects, as well as any sphere effect that originates from the Blood
      sphere that is otherwise subject to spell resistance. Creatures that can
      bypass immunity to bleed effects also bypass the crimson dancer&#8217;s
      immunity to sphere effects from the Blood sphere. The crimson dancer may
      suppress these immunities if she so desires when targeted by an effect she
      would be immune to, although she cannot then later choose to become immune
      to that effect while it is ongoing.</p>

      <p>This is a supernatural effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> With the GM&#8217;s permission, the bonuses
      granted from this ability may also apply against non-Duelist sphere or
      Blood sphere effects that also pertain to blood, bleed effects or other
      things of a similar nature.</p>
