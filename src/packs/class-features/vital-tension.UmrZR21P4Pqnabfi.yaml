      <p>The striker can spend 1 tension to be treated as though she had the
      Vital Strike feat for a number of rounds equal to her Constitution
      modifier. At 10th level, she is instead treated as though she possessed
      the Improved Vital Strike feat. At 15th level, she is instead treated as
      though she possessed the Greater Vital Strike feat.</p>
