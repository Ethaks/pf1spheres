      <p>At 3rd level, a symbiat gains the ability to unconsciously push their
      body to greater speeds through their telekinesis. The symbiat gains a +10
      feet bonus to their base movement speed. This bonus increases by +10 feet
      for every 3 symbiat levels possessed beyond 3rd, to a maximum of +60 feet
      at 18th level.</p>
