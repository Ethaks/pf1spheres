    value: >
      <p>At 10th level, the soul weaver may use lesion to take control of a
      target instead of damaging it. The blight spreads to their brain
      (Fortitude negates), giving them 4 points of ability drain to all mental
      ability scores and giving the soul weaver control over them for 1 hour per
      level or until the blight is cured. For the duration of this effect, the
      target can make only a standard action or move action on their turn, but
      not both.</p>

      <p>The target obeys all verbal commands (without a shared language, only
      basic commands such as come, fight, or stand still may be communicated)
      and does anything asked to the best of its ability, including
      self-destructive commands (a target command to hurt or kill itself deals
      its weapon damage + its Strength damage to itself per round until dead).
      Effects such as protection from evil or the Hallow word from the Fate
      sphere do not end this effect, since it is the result of a physical malady
      rather than a mind-altering or possession effect.</p>

      <p>Unlike the standard lesion ability, mind blight does not consume the
      target&#8217;s blight when used, and the target may be subject to another
      lesion or mind blight, even while already under the effects of a mind
      blight. If another soul weaver attempts to use mind blight on a target
      already under the effects of mind blight, the two soul weavers make
      opposed checks (d20 + their soul weaver level + their casting ability
      modifier) to determine who wins control of the target. Drain from multiple
      mind blights are cumulative.</p>
