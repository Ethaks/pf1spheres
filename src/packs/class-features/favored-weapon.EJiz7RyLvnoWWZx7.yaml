      <p>The striker can select a single light melee weapon or ranged weapon
      which can be used with 1 hand (such as a light crossbow or pistol), or any
      improvised weapon they would treat as a light melee weapon, treating it as
      though it was her unarmed strike for how much damage it deals and striker
      class features (but not for combat spheres and talents); a weapon used
      with this talent has its critical multiplier reduced to x2.</p>
