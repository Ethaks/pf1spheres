      <p>Whenever the fey adept ceases to concentrate on an illusion he is
      maintaining through concentration, or if he decides not to maintain an
      illusion at all after its creation, it remains for a number of rounds
      equal to 1/2 his fey adept level (minimum 1) before disappearing.</p>
