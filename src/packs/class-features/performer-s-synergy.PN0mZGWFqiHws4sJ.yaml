      <p>A troubadour has played so many parts in his life that he can pull
      expertise from them at a moment&#8217;s notice to give himself insight and
      resilience of mind and heart. Whenever the troubadour is in his base
      persona, he gains a +1 morale bonus to all saving throws. This bonus
      increase by 1 at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, the troubadour&#8217;s ability to perform a variety of
      parts means he no longer needs to prepare a persona to access a
      trope&#8217;s benefit. As a move action, the troubadour can grant his base
      persona one trope of his choice, so long as he has at least one persona
      with that trope. He does not, however, gain any persona quirks. The
      troubadour retains this trope indefinitely, until he spends another move
      action to choose a different trope benefit to gain, which then replaces
      the first. Abilities with a limited number of uses (such as the lover or
      cunning servant trope powers) share their uses between the base persona
      and any other personas that possess them.</p>

      <p>At 20th level, the troubadour can grant his base persona two trope
      benefits as a move action, rather than only one.</p>
