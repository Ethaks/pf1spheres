      <p>City streets, rooftops, cobbled roads, and grimy sewers are the ideal
      battlefields for some commanders. When fighting or traveling in urban
      terrain the commander and any ally affected by one of his tactics or
      shouts gain a competence bonus to Acrobatics checks made to cross a
      rooftop or traverse a sewer and to Diplomacy checks made to direct a crowd
      equal 1/2 the commander&#8217;s class level. In addition, the commander
      and any ally affected by one of his tactics or shouts increase any AC
      bonuses from cover by +2 while fighting in urban environments.</p>
