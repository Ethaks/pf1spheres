      <p>At 19th level, whenever a mageknight successfully confirms a critical
      hit, she can use a sphere ability as an immediate action. The sphere
      ability must include the target of the attack as one of its targets or in
      its area of effect. Using this sphere ability does not provoke an attack
      of opportunity.</p>
