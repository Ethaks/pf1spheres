      <p>The mageknight gains an animal companion, treating her mageknight level
      -3 as her effective druid level. This stacks normally with other druid
      levels.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the mageknight may take a lesser c&#249;-s&#236;th as
      their companion. This functions as a wolf animal companion, except that it
      has an Intelligence score of 10 and the mageknight may spend a spell point
      as an immediate action on her lesser c&#249;-s&#236;th&#8217;s turn to
      allow it to use its baleful howl special attack as a standard action, with
      a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 its Hit Dice + her casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Baleful Howl (Su)</strong> As a standard action, the
      c&#249;-s&#236;th can release a howl of ill omen. All enemies within 60
      feet take a -4 penalty to saves against curse and death effects and
      against the c&#249;-s&#236;th&#8217;s soul shepherd ability, as well as a
      -4 penalty to AC. These penalties last for 5 rounds. These penalties are
      reduced to -1 and last only a single round with a successful Will save.
      This is a sonic curse effect.</p>
