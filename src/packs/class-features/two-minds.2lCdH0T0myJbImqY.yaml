      <p>At 5th level, a symbiat&#8217;s two minds give him a greater resilience
      to mind-affecting attacks. Whenever the symbiat attempts a Will saving
      throw, he may roll twice and take the better result. If the symbiat would
      be able to roll twice through any other ability, he may roll three times
      and take the better result.</p>
