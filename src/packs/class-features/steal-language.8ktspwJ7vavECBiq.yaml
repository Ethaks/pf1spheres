      <p>At 5th level, a shifter can not only change her body, but also her
      mind. The shifter may touch a target, gaining for 24 hours the ability to
      speak and understand one language that creature speaks. This can work on
      animals and other creatures that do not have a language, but only allows
      communication with that particular type of creature (eagle, dog, wolf,
      etc.). She may only have one language acquired at a time in this manner;
      acquiring a second language dismisses the first.</p>
