      <p>The incanter gains the bloodline powers (but not the bloodline spells,
      feats, or arcana) of one sorcerer bloodline of his choice. If he already
      gains a sorcerer bloodline from another class, this instead allows levels
      of that class and his incanter levels to stack when gaining and
      determining the powers and abilities of his sorcerer bloodline. Use his
      casting ability modifier in place of his Charisma modifier when
      determining the powers of his bloodline, if it is higher.</p>
