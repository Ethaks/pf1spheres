    value: >
      <p>When wearing light armor or no armor, not carrying a shield, and
      unencumbered, the striker adds her Constitution bonus (if any) to her AC
      and her CMD; this bonus cannot exceed her class level. (A 1st level
      striker with 16 Constitution still gains only a +1 bonus to her armor
      class from this class feature.) This AC bonus does not stack with any
      class features which share the same name as it.</p>

      <p>This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when the striker
      is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or
      helpless, when she wears medium or heavy armor, uses a shield, or when she
      carries a medium or heavy load.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> This stacks with the Equipment
      Sphere's Unarmored Training talent. You can also get Unarmored Training as
      a Striker Art. (<a
