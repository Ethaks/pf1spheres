      <p>The scholar&#8217;s studies have taught her how to identify objects
      that serve as natural dowsing rods capable of leading her towards a
      person, place, or thing. The scholar must have seen the thing she seeks or
      an accurate representation of it (such as a detailed portrait) in order
      for this ability to work. If searching for a non-specific type of thing
      (such as the nearest body of water, the nearest city, etc.) the scholar
      need not have seen it or a representation before, but the rod becomes much
      less accurate, and may lead to something other than what she seeks (for
      example, a scholar seeking the nearest body of water could be led to a
      puddle or the ocean, and one seeking the nearest city could be led to a
      bustling metropolis or the ruins of an ancient civilization). Once
      activated, the dowsing rod will always point towards the desired target,
      though it gives no indication as to the target&#8217;s distance and always
      points directly towards it, regardless of obstacles. If the target is
      protected by a nondetection spell or similar effect, the scholar uses her
      class level as her caster level when determining if her dowsing rod can
      pierce the effect. This is a supernatural effect, except for when using it
      to locate the nearest body or source of water, in which case it can be
      used as an extraordinary ability.</p>
