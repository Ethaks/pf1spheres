      <p><strong>Shielded Adept (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript may
      treat heavy and tower shields as light weapons, and decreases the armor
      check penalty of any shield he wields by 1. In addition, bucklers are
      treated as heavy shields when determining how much damage they deal.</p>

      <p><strong>Shield Striker (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, a conscript&#8217;s
      first use of active defense each round does not require him to expend an
      attack of opportunity, and he adds his shield bonus to his Reflex
      saves.</p>

      <p><strong>Shielded Defender (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript
      carrying a shield gains the benefits of heavy fortification, and the
      hardness of any shield he wields is increased by an amount equal to his
      practitioner modifier.</p>
