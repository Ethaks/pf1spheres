      <p>At 14th level, the soul weaver may use lesion to kill a target rather
      than damage it or take control of it. The target dies instantly (Fortitude
      negates) and raises the next round as a zombie under the soul
      weaver&#8217;s control for 1 hour per level. After the time is up, the
      body collapses and becomes simply another dead body. On a successful save,
      the target still suffers 1d8 damage per soul weaver level.</p>
