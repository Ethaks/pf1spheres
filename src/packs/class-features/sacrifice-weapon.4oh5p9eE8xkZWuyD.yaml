      <p>When damage would cause the armiger or an ally within her current
      active weapon&#8217;s reach to be knocked unconscious or killed, as an
      immediate action she may expend her martial focus to instead direct the
      damage to an active weapon. The original target takes no damage, but the
      weapon receives only half its normal hardness. The armiger cannot use this
      option with natural attacks or unarmed attacks.</p>
