    value: >
      <p>At 6th level, whenever a critical hit is confirmed against the
      sentinel, she can expend her martial focus as a free action which can be
      taken even when it is not her turn to make an opposed attack roll. If the
      sentinel&#8217;s attack roll is higher than the confirmation roll for the
      critical hit, the critical hit instead deals normal damage. A helpless
      sentinel cannot use this ability.</p>
