      <p>At 1st level, the conscript gains the Berserker sphere as a bonus
      sphere. If he already possesses a drawback that would remove berserking,
      he instead buys off that drawback.</p>

      <p>The conscript is treated as having the barbarian's rage class feature,
      and treats his conscript levels as barbarian levels for the purposes of
      qualifying for feats, prerequisites, and determining the effects of rage
      powers. The conscript may use a rage power while berserking as though it
      were an (adrenaline) talent. The conscript may use rage powers as though
      they were (adrenaline) talents a number of rounds per day equal to 2 + his
      conscript level + his practitioner modifier.</p>

      <p>The conscript must expend martial focus to use rage powers which
      specify &#8220;once per rage&#8221;, and may only use them once per
      minute. The conscript treats rounds of this ability as rage rounds for the
      purposes of feats, class features, and other abilities, and may expend
      rounds of this ability when an ability would require the conscript to
      spend rounds of rage to use.</p>

      <p>At 3rd, 6th, and 16th level, the conscript gains a rage power and is
      treated as having the rage power class feature for the purposes of
      qualifying for feats and prerequisites, such as taking Extra Rage Power as
      a feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> For rage powers with prerequisites (e.g.
      &#8220;totem&#8221; rage powers such as Beast Totem and Fiendish Totem,
      &#8220;blood&#8221; rage powers such as Abyssal Blood or Draconic Blood,
      or any other rage power that otherwise has rage powers as prerequisites),
      using that rage power as an (adrenaline) also grants the conscript the
      benefits of all prerequisite rage powers.</p>
