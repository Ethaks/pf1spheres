      <p>Whether supplying an army or a small group of adventurers, the
      commander always knows how to find the best supplies at the lowest price.
      Whenever he buys an item that costs 500 gp or less, he can buy it at 90%
      of the market price. If the commander buys multiples of such an item in
      units of 5 or more, he may instead buy it at 70% of market price.</p>
