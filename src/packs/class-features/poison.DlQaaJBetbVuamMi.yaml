    value: >
      <p>The shifter selects a single natural attack (one claw, bite, etc.) she
      possesses. This natural attack inflicts poison on a successful attack
      (injury; save Fortitude DC 10 + 1/2 her shifter level + her Constitution
      modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Constitution damage;
      cure 1 save). If the shifter loses that natural attack due to a
      shapeshift, she may designate a different natural attack for this to
      augment for the duration. She may select this trait multiple times. The
      effects do not stack. Each time it is gained, select another natural
      attack to inflict poison.</p>
