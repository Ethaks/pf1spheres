      <p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to gain the
      benefits of one combat feat of her choice for a number of minutes equal to
      her casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p>She must meet all of this feat&#8217;s prerequisites. At 7th level, she
      may gain the benefits of two combat feats of her choice whenever she uses
      this ability, and one may be used to meet the prerequisites of the other.
      At 14th level, she gains the benefits of three combat feats of her choice.
      Multiple uses of this ability do not stack, only the most recent use
      applies. If a combat feat has a limited number of daily uses (such as
      Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability
      counts towards that feat&#8217;s daily limit.</p>
