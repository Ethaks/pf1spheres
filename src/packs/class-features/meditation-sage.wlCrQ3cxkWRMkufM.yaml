      <p>The sage can spend 1 hour in quiet contemplation to gather and
      reinforce his mental and spiritual energies in preparation for the task
      ahead. When the sage meditates in this manner, he gains a pool of bonus
      dice equal to 1/2 his class level (rounded down, minimum 1) that can be
      spent whenever he makes an ability check, skill check, or saving throw to
      add 1d6 to the roll. The sage can also use this ability whenever an
      opponent uses an ability which targets the sage&#8217;s CMD to add 1d6 to
      his CMD against the attempt. The sage cannot gain more bonus dice at one
      time than half his class level using this ability.</p>
