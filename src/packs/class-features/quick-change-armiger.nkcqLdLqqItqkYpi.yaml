      <p>At 1st level, an armiger gains the benefits of the Quick Draw feat with
      her customized weapons and may stow customized weapons as a free action
      once per round, plus one additional time at 5th level and every 5 levels
      thereafter. This class feature counts as possessing the Quick Draw feat
      for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of other feats, though any
      feat qualified for this way may only be applied to customized weapons.</p>
