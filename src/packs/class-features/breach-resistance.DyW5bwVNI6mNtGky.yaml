      <p>Once per round, when you successfully hit a creature with an attack,
      you may reduce any spell resistance they possess by 1 for 1 minute per
      mageknight level. This penalty stacks with itself. At 10th level and every
      10 levels thereafter, the spell resistance reduction on each attack
      increases by 1.</p>
