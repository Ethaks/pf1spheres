      <p>The shifter adds her shifter level as a bonus on all Acrobatics checks
      made to jump. When attempting a jump, she is always considered to have a
      running start. The shifter may attempt an Acrobatics check to jump as part
      of her charge. If her vertical height exceeds the height of her target,
      the target is flat-footed against the attacks granted by that charge and
      the critical threat range of her natural attacks is increased by 1. This
      increase stacks with and is applied after effects such as keen and
      Improved Critical.</p>
