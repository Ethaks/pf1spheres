      <p>Through dark caverns and narrow tunnels, the commander is an expert in
      fighting underground. When fighting or traveling in underground terrain
      the commander and any ally affected by one of his tactics or shouts gain
      low-light vision, or double the range of their existing low-light vision.
      In addition, any creature benefiting from this ability may roll their miss
      chance due to concealment twice and take the most favorable result, and
      gain a competence bonus on Survival checks, and Perception checks made to
      notice natural hazards, equal to 1/2 the commander&#8217;s class
      level.</p>
