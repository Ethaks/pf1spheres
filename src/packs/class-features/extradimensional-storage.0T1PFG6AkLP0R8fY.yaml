    value: >
      <p>The armorist gains the Extradimensional Storage Warp sphere talent,
      even if she does not possess the Warp sphere. She may use her armorist
      level as her caster level for this ability if it is higher, and she may
      choose to summon items from her extradimensional storage with the same
      action and with the same rules (such as replacing one suit of armor with
      another) as her other summoned equipment.</p>

      <p>She may take this arsenal trick twice, which upgrades her spell-like
      ability to have the effect of two purchases of Extradimensional
      Storage.</p>
