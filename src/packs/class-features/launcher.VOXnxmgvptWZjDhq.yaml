      <p>The technician can create a gadget to allow him to throw an object. The
      object can travel 10 ft. + 5 ft. per technician level before the
      technician begins adding range penalties or calculating its maximum
      range.</p>

      <p>This gadget can be used at the same time as another gadget to hurl that
      first gadget a greater distance. This expends a gadget for the launcher as
      well as for the hurled gadget. The technician cannot attach more than one
      launcher to a device or object.</p>

      <h2 id="toc8"><span><span style="color: #993300">Trap
      Specialist</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 1st level, the technician gains the Trap sphere as a bonus sphere.
      If he already possesses this sphere, he instead gains one talent from that
      sphere.</p>

      <h2 id="toc9"><span><span style="color:
      #993300">Trapfinding</span></span></h2>

      <p>A technician adds 1/2 his level on Perception checks to locate traps
      and on all Disable Device checks (minimum +1). A technician can use
      Disable Device to disarm magic traps.</p>

      <h2 id="toc10"><span><span style="color:
      #993300">Inventions</span></span></h2>

      <p>Every technician knows how to create custom items, called inventions.
      Inventions could be anything from a simple improved crossbow, to a
      powerful and complex machine that to the uneducated appears to be magic.
      Inventions are finicky, improvised things that require constant tinkering
      and fixing, and there is a limit to how many a technician can maintain at
      any one time. A technician can have and maintain a maximum of 1 invention
      at 1st level, plus an additional invention at 3rd level and every 4 levels
      thereafter. If the technician has already reached this limit and wishes to
      create a new invention, he must select one of his existing inventions to
      dismantle. Whenever an invention includes an ability that calls for a
      saving throw, the DC equals 10 + 1/2 the technician&#8217;s class level +
      the technician&#8217;s Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p>Some inventions have prerequisites, which must be met before the
      invention can be created. These prerequisites might be items, a cost in gp
      for specialty parts, or feats and skill ranks the technician must possess.
      A technician may create any invention which he meets the necessary
      prerequisites to create.</p>

      <p>Creating an invention takes 8 hours of work. The work need not be
      consecutive, and the technician can do this work while out adventuring,
      but in that situation he can only devote 4 hours each day to item
      creation, and only nets 2 hours&#8217; worth of work due to being in a
      distracting environment. Once the invention has been created, altering its
      improvements requires only 1 hour of work.</p>

      <p>See 'inventions' at the bottom of this page for more information on
      creating inventions.</p>

      <h2 id="toc11"><span><span style="color: #993300">Technical
      Insight</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the technician gains
      additional insights that expand his knowledge and capacity. He may choose
      one of the technical insights below. Unless otherwise noted, a technical
      insight may only be selected once.</p>

      <p>See below for more information on creating inventions.</p>

      <h2 id="toc12"><span><span style="color: #993300">Technically
      Minded</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 2nd level, a technician gains a bonus to all Knowledge (engineering)
      checks equal to 1/2 his technician level, and takes half the usual time
      when using the Craft skill to repair an object.</p>

      <p>Whenever the technician uses the Disable Device skill, he reduces the
      required time by 1 step (2d4 rounds, 1d4 rounds, 1 round, a standard
      action, a move action, a swift action).</p>

      <h2 id="toc13"><span><span style="color: #993300">Danger Sense
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 3rd level, a technician gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid
      traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In
      addition, he gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being
      surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 technician levels
      thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap
      sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite. The bonuses
      gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from
      another class).</p>

      <h2 id="toc14"><span><span style="color: #993300">Trap Insight
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 3rd level the technician gains Heightened Awareness from the Scout
      sphere, whether or not he possesses that sphere. If he already possesses
      that talent, he may instead gain any one martial talent for which he
      qualifies.</p>

      <h2 id="toc15"><span><span style="color: #993300">Trapmaster
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 7th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 2 steps instead of 1.</p>

      <p>When a technician disarms a trap through the Disable Device skill and
      beats the trap&#8217;s DC by 10 or more, in addition to being able to pass
      by the trap without activating it, he gains one of the following benefits
      as well:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Trap Sphere:</strong> If the technician beats the DC by 10 of
      a trap from the Trap sphere, he may take control of that trap. The
      trap&#8217;s previous owner is no longer able to pass through the
      trap&#8217;s space unharmed, although any creatures who knew where the
      trap was placed still gain the usual bonuses against activating the trap.
      Additionally, the technician may upgrade the trap if it is inferior to his
      own and it is a trap he is able to create, changing its variables such as
      damage, and saving throws, to become as if he had been the one to place
      the trap.</li>

      <li><strong>Magical Trap:</strong> When disarming a magic trap that allows
      specific creatures to pass without danger and beating the trap&#8217;s DC
      by 10 or more, the technician can modify which creatures are allowed to
      pass, such as adding his allies or restricting his enemies if he
      desires.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 id="toc16"><span><span style="color: #993300">Greater Trapmaster
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 11th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 3 steps instead of 2, to a minimum of a swift
      action.</p>

      <p>In addition to using Disable Device to sabotage mechanical gadgets, the
      technician can also use the Disable Device skill to tamper with magical
      effects as well. With 2d4 rounds of work (reduced to 1 round with the
      benefits of trapmaster and greater trapmaster), the technician may make a
      Disable Device check (DC 11 + the effect&#8217;s caster level) that
      dispels magical effects on a creature or area.</p>

      <p>Instantaneous effects cannot be disabled in this fashion. The
      technician may target a specific effect if he has identified it, otherwise
      the effect with the highest caster level is affected first. He may also
      target a magical item, in which case the magic is not dispelled, but is
      instead suppressed for 1d4 rounds. The technician must be touching the
      target to affect it in this way; he may use this power on an unwilling
      target, but must succeed at a melee touch attack, and must remain in
      contact with the target for the entire process (if this process requires 1
      round or longer, often the target must be grappled, helpless, unaware of
      the technician, or in some other way unable to get away from the
      technician for the duration).</p>

      <h2 id="toc17"><span><span style="color: #993300">Supreme Trapmaster
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 15th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 4 steps instead of 3, to a minimum of a swift action. In
      addition, the technician may use his Disable Device skill to dispel all
      non-item magical effects on a target, rather than just one. When making
      the Disable Device check, compare it to each effect individually; if the
      check exceeds a DC of 11 + that effect&#8217;s caster level, the effect
      ends.</p>

      <h2 id="toc18"><span><span style="color: #993300">Perfect Trapmaster
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 19th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 5 steps instead of 4, to a minimum of a swift action. In
      addition, when the technician is the direct target of an unwanted magical
      effect, as an immediate action he may attempt a Disable Device check to
      negate the incoming effect before it can affect him, as detailed under
      greater trapmaster.</p>

      <h2 id="toc19"><span><span style="color: #993300">True
      Genius</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level, the technician gains a permanent +2 bonus to all mental
      ability scores.</p>
