      <p>A striker is at home in battle, thriving on the raw energy of combat to
      fuel her attacks. A striker begins the day with no tension, but can gain
      tension in the following ways (a striker cannot gain tension from each of
      these more than once per round and a striker must be in combat to gain
      tension):</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Offensive Pressure:</strong> Whenever the striker successfully
      damages a creature with an unarmed strike or makes successful combat
      maneuver check against a creature to initiate a combat maneuver, she gains
      1 tension.</li>

      <li><strong>Defensive Determination:</strong> Whenever the striker takes
      damage from an attack originating from a creature (including spells,
      spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities), she gains 1 tension. A
      striker does not gain tension from attacks made against her while she is
      flat-footed or unaware.</li>

      <li><strong>Maneuvering Momentum:</strong> Whenever the striker moves 10
      ft. or more during her turn (this cannot be forced movement), she gains 1
      tension.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Her tension goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go
      higher than her Constitution modifier (minimum 1), though some feats,
      abilities, and magic items may affect this maximum. At 3rd level and every
      three levels afterward, her maximum tension increases by 1. If a striker
      spends 1 minute or longer outside of combat, she loses all tension she
      possesses.</p>
