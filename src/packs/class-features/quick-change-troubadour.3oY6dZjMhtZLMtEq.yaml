      <p>At 2nd level, the troubadour may adopt or change a prepared persona
      much more quickly than normal, but doing so is very mentally taxing and
      cannot be done often. Once per day, the troubadour can change his prepared
      persona as a move action. This does not allow the troubadour to adopt a
      disguise to appear as that persona as part of that same move action. The
      troubadour can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level,
      and every 4 troubadour levels thereafter.</p>
