    value: >
      <p>At 20th level, the warden becomes an unstoppable protector of those
      under his charge, his resolve surpassing even the finality of death
      itself. The warden may have up to five guarded allies at one time.
      Additionally, whenever the warden would fall unconscious or be slain, his
      soul rises from his body, appearing barely visible and ethereal. While
      within this ethereal form, the warden may move in any direction (even up
      or down, albeit at half his normal speed), and may move through solid
      objects and living creatures, essentially being considered as an ethereal
      creature, except that he may still cast harmless spells and sphere effects
      upon his allies as long as he remains within this form.</p>

      <p>The warden remains within this form for up to 1 minute, after which the
      soul returns to his body, immediately becoming stable and conscious again
      if he was unconscious, or linger for a moment if he was slain.</p>
