      <p>Whether over sandy dunes or through blasted wastelands, the commander
      learns to excel and lead his allies to thrive where others wither. When
      fighting or traveling in desert terrain, the commander and any ally
      affected by one of his tactics or shouts can ignore the effects of
      non-magical difficult terrain, double the distance at which they can make
      Perception checks to detect the presence of other creatures, gain a bonus
      on Perception checks to notice natural hazards equal to the higher of the
      commander&#8217;s Charisma or Intelligence modifiers (minimum 1), and are
      immune to nonlethal damage caused by exposure to heat or sandstorms.</p>
