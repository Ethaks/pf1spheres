      <p>At 10th level, a fey adept can use the Stealth skill even while being
      observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a fey
      adept can hide himself from view in the open without anything to actually
      hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.</p>
