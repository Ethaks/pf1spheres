      <p>The mageknight can sense any creature she has left a magical mark on
      using her marked ability. She always knows the direction and distance to
      them and what plane they are currently on.</p>

      <p>As a full-round action she may spend a spell point to teleport herself
      to a square adjacent to a marked creature regardless of their distance
      from her, though she cannot travel between planes this way.</p>
