      <p>The scholar activates this imposition by quickly mixing a piece of
      belladonna root with several other herbs and minerals and then ingesting
      it or feeding it to an adjacent ally. This mixture protects the target
      from being subjected to the belladonna&#8217;s poison, and confers several
      of its properties to them. First, the target is immune to lycanthropy; if
      the target has already been afflicted with lycanthropy, they cannot be
      affected by or benefit from any of its effects for the duration of this
      ability. Secondly, the target gains a circumstance bonus to their armor
      class against all natural attacks equal to the scholar&#8217;s
      Intelligence bonus. These effects last for a number of rounds equal to the
      scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus. In addition, her work with belladonna
      has made the scholar particularly adept at treating and preventing
      poisoning; whenever the scholar uses her medical training, advanced
      medical training, or expert medical training on a creature, the subject
      becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any
      poison to which it is exposed during the effect&#8217;s duration does not
      affect the subject until the effect&#8217;s duration has expired, though
      the duration of the effect continues to expire as normal; this does not
      reverse instantaneous effects of poison that have already occurred, such
      as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don&#8217;t
      go away on their own.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Belladonna Bursts [explosive]:</strong> The scholar may
      enhance her flashbangs with crushed belladonna, causing targets who fail
      their save to take 1d6 points of Strength damage, plus an additional 1d6
      points of Strength damage at 8th and 16th level, in addition to the normal
      effects. This is a poison effect, and creatures with resistance to poison
      apply that resistance to their save against the flashbang&#8217;s
      effects.</li>
