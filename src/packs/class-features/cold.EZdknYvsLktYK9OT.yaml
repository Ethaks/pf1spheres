      <p>The commander is an expert at fighting and leading warriors on icy
      glaciers and across snowy tundras. When fighting or traveling in such
      terrain, the commander and any ally affected by one of his tactics or
      shouts are not impeded by ice effects (Pathfinder Core Rulebook, Cold
      Dangers), are immune to nonlethal damage caused by cold exposure, do not
      take a penalty to ranged attacks or Perception checks when fighting in
      snow, and take only the standard penalties for snow when fighting in heavy
      snow.</p>
