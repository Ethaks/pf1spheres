      <p>At 9th level, the scholar&#8217;s research has taught her rare and
      little known techniques for treating even the most virulent and uncommon
      ailments; the scholar may expend 10 uses of a healer&#8217;s kit as a
      standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity and make a DC 25 Heal
      check to cure any one of the following conditions affecting a creature:
      confusion, cursed, or disease (including magical diseases).</p>

      <p>If the scholar has at least 11 ranks in the Heal skill, she may instead
      use this ability to attempt to heal an ally who has died within a number
      of rounds equal to her Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). If her check is
      successful, the ally is restored to life and consciousness at 0 hit
      points, +1 hit point for each point by which she exceeds this
      check&#8217;s DC. The scholar can only attempt to heal a particular
      creature with this ability a number of times per day equal to her
      Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Attempting to heal a creature but failing
      to meet the DC of this ability still counts towards this daily total. In
      addition, the scholar increases healing done by the hit point healing
      option of the medical training class feature to 3 hit points +3 for each
      point by which the scholar exceeds the DC, may activate it as a swift
      action, and no longer provokes an attack of opportunity for using any of
      her medical training abilities.</p>
