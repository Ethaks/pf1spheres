      <p>A warden of sentimentality is one of nostalgia and time, usually
      showing fragments of the future, present and past to their allies,
      allowing them to prepare accordingly. These wardens are just as focused on
      preparing their allies as they are hindering their enemies, dilating and
      hastening time when required.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Time</p>

      <p><strong>Temporal Guard:</strong> A sentimental warden&#8217;s guard is
      made up of brief past images of the warden. At 3rd level, the
      warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a bonus to initiative checks equal to
      the warden&#8217;s guard bonus. Additionally, spells, sphere effects,
      spelllike abilities and supernatural abilities that the warden casts on
      his guarded allies that have a duration measured in rounds last 1
      additional round.</p>

      <p><strong>Fluctuating Patrol:</strong> At 7th level, the warden may spend
      a spell point when using his patrol ability to cause time to distort and
      shift. All enemies within the warden&#8217;s area of patrol must succeed a
      Will saving throw or have the duration of all beneficial effects affecting
      them reduced by 1 round, and the duration of all harmful effects affecting
      them increased by 1 round. If the warden would reactivate his patrol
      before the end of his next turn, he can keep extending the duration of the
      ability by one additional round without spending a spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Deja Vu:</strong> At 11th level, whenever an ally within the
      warden&#8217;s guard range would fail a saving throw, attack roll or skill
      check, the next time that ally would attempt the same kind of roll within
      the next round, the ally gains a +4 bonus to that attempt.</p>

      <p><strong>Timeline Split:</strong> At 15th level, whenever one of the
      warden&#8217;s guarded allies would make an attack roll, they may choose
      two possible targets for the attack, and then roll the d20 for each
      target. The guarded ally may then choose which enemy they attack, using
      the d20 rolled for that enemy as their attack roll. Additionally, whenever
      a guarded ally would attempt a saving throw, as an immediate action, the
      warden can spend a spell point to allow the guarded ally to roll the
      saving throw twice and take the most favourable result.</p>

      <p><strong>Temporal Erosion:</strong> At 19th level, time begins to warp
      and shift around the warden, with occasional tears showing the previous,
      present, and future lives of his allies. As a standard action, the warden
      can spend 2 spell points to cause the area around him to buckle and tear,
      granting all allies (guarded or not) within 20 feet a collective ablation
      rate of 80%. Whenever an ally would be missed due to the miss chance
      granted by the ablation rate, all allies&#8217; ablation rates decrease by
      the same amount (5%). This ability lasts for 1 minute, or until the
      ablation rate becomes equal to or less than 0, whichever comes first.</p>

      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc74"><span>Grant Reaction (requires sentimentality)</span></h4>

      <p>Whenever an ally within the warden&#8217;s area of patrol would be
      unable to make an attack of opportunity due to having no more attacks of
      opportunities remaining, the warden may expend an attack of opportunity to
      grant the ally an additional attack of opportunity.</p>

      <h4 id="toc75"><span>Suspended Guard (requires sentimentality, warden
      6)</span></h4>

      <p>When using his guard ability, he may instead choose two creatures to
      benefit from a suspended guard. A suspended guard does not grant any
      benefits to the chosen creatures, however, as an immediate action, the
      warden may choose one of the chosen creatures to immediately gain the
      benefits of his guard ability.</p>
