    value: >
      <p>At 15th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 4 steps instead of 3, to a minimum of a swift action. In
      addition, the technician may use his Disable Device skill to dispel all
      non-item magical effects on a target, rather than just one. When making
      the Disable Device check, compare it to each effect individually; if the
      check exceeds a DC of 11 + that effect&#8217;s caster level, the effect
      ends.</p>
