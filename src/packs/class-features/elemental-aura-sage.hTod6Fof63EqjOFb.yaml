    value: >
      <p>The sage converts his ki into a raw energy aura that protects him by
      damaging his foes and amplifying his attacks. As long as the sage has at
      least 1 point of ki in his ki pool, he can spend a swift action to shroud
      his body in an aura of acid, cold, fire, or electricity (chosen when he
      activates this ability) that deals 1d8 damage, plus 1d8 damage for every 4
      class levels he possesses, of the corresponding type to any creature who
      strikes the sage with a melee attack or otherwise comes into direct
      physical contact with the sage (such as when performing a combat maneuver
      or delivering a touch spell) for a number of rounds equal to the
      sage&#8217;s Wisdom modifier, or 1 minute if he expends a point of ki when
      activating this ability. While this ability is active, this additional
      damage is also added to the sage&#8217;s unarmed strikes and chi gong
      melee touch attacks, and dealt to any creature the sage successfully
      performs a combat maneuver against. The sage may end this effect as a free
      action. If the sage has the ki blaster esoteric training package, he can
      spend 1 point of ki while this ability is active as part of making a ki
      blast attack to add the energy damage to his ki blast damage until the
      start of his next turn; when using this ability, all ki blast attacks made
      for the round after the first are treated as having had 1 additional ki
      point spent on them when determining the maximum amount of ki that can be
      spent to modify their effects.</p>
