    value: >
      <p>At 1st level, when the crimson dancer uses an attack action or attack
      of opportunity to deal damage with a melee weapon, she inflicts her
      bloodletting on that creature.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, when she spends at least a standard action creating a
      magic sphere effect that allows a saving throw or requires an attack roll,
      any creatures struck by the effect or that fail their save are inflicted
      with her bloodletting. For magic sphere effects that linger and make
      multiple attack rolls or require multiple saving throws over many rounds,
      only the first saving throw or attack roll per creature inflicts
      bloodletting. When bloodletting is inflicted, a creature suffers bleed
      damage equal to half the crimson dancer&#8217;s Charisma modifier (minimum
      1). This bleed damage stacks with any bleed damage originating from the
      crimson dancer. When inflicting bloodletting on a creature already
      suffering from it, the bleed damage is increased by the amount of bleed
      damage that would be applied. Unless otherwise specified, the maximum
      amount of bleed damage a crimson dancer may apply with the bloodletting
      ability to a creature is equal to the crimson dancer&#8217;s level.</p>

      <p>Creatures suffering the maximum amount of bloodletting bleed damage the
      crimson dancer can inflict are exsanguinated.</p>
