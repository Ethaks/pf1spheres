    value: >
      <p>When creating a persona or disguise via the Disguise skill, you may
      grant yourself a powerful aura corresponding to its alignment, as an
      aligned undead or outsider with Hit Dice up to your class level, or a
      cleric, paladin, or antipaladin of up to your class level. You may make
      personas of the outsider or undead creature type, provided the creature
      imitated possesses your basic physiology (the same number of limbs, not
      incorporeal, etc.). The GM has the final say on whether or not it is even
      possible to imitate a given creature.</p>
