      <p>Upon successfully using his possession ability, the wraith may spend a
      spell point as a free action to calculate the duration of the possession
      as if the creature&#8217;s CR was 1 tier lower per Table: Possession
      Duration. For creatures with a challenge rating below the wraith&#8217;s
      class level -4, the duration instead increases from 10 minutes/level to 1
      hour per level for active possession or to indefinite (new save granted
      every 24 hours) for passive possession.</p>
