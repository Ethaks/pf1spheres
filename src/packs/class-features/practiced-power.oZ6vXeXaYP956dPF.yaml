      <p>Regardless of his actual physical might, the blacksmith&#8217;s time
      working at a forge has enabled him to strike with power beyond what his
      frame should allow. The blacksmith gains a +1 competence bonus to his
      combat maneuver bonus and damage rolls made with hammers when using an
      attack action to sunder, plus an additional +1 at 5th level and every 5
      levels thereafter.</p>
