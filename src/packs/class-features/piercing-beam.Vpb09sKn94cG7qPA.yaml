      <p>The sage may spend a ki point when attacking with his ki blast to
      change it into a 30 ft. line, dealing his ki blast damage to all creatures
      it passes through unless they succeed at a Reflex saving throw. For every
      5 class levels the sage possesses, the length of the line increases by 5
      ft.</p>
