      <p>Choose a number of skills equal to the troubadour&#8217;s Intelligence
      modifier (minimum: 1). He may take 10 on these skills even when
      circumstances would normally make this impossible. The troubadour must be
      at least 10th level to select this actor training. This actor training may
      be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, select additional skills
      to gain this benefit.</p>
