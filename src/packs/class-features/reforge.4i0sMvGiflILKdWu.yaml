      <p>From 3rd level on, the blacksmith&#8217;s experience with crafting
      excellent equipment allows him to manipulate and rework magical equipment
      without damaging or sacrificing its magical potency. The blacksmith can
      spend 1 hour per total effective bonus (minimum 1 hour) of an enchanted
      armor, weapon, or shield (enhancement bonus plus permanent special ability
      bonus equivalents) at an operational forge to reforge the equipment into
      another equivalent item at no additional cost; weapons into weapons of
      another type, armor into a separate type of armor, and shields into
      weapons, armor, or other types of shields; a heavy shield can be converted
      into a light shield or vice versa, and a tower shield can be converted
      into any other type of shield, but bucklers, light shields and heavy
      shields cannot be converted into tower shields. When reforging, the
      blacksmith cannot exchange one piece of equipment for another that is not
      predominantly made out of the same dominant material; a greatclub can be
      reforged into a quarterstaff or spear, but not into a bastard sword, and a
      suit of platemail could be reforged into a breastplate or chain shirt, but
      not into a suit of leather armor. The new weapon or armor must be the same
      size or smaller as the original.</p>

      <p>In addition, the blacksmith can restore a magic weapon, armor, or
      shield that has been destroyed by a sunder attack or similar ability; if
      the blacksmith can acquire all the broken pieces of the equipment, he may
      restore it to its original complete condition, including all enchantments,
      with 8 hours of work at an operational forge.</p>
