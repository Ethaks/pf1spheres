      <p><strong>Shift (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter can teleport to
      a nearby space as a swift action. This movement does not provoke an attack
      of opportunity. He must be able to see the space that he is moving into.
      He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability (except
      for familiars). He can move 5 feet for every two incanter levels he
      possesses (minimum 5 feet). He can use this ability a number of times per
      day equal to 3 + his casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Dimensional Lord (Sp):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a
      creature attempts to use a teleportation effect or summon a creature
      within 30 feet of him, the incanter may attempt to block the effect by
      attempting a magic skill check as an immediate action. If the check
      succeeds, the effect or spell fails and is wasted; otherwise, it is
      unaffected. He can use this ability once per day plus one additional time
      for every 6 incanter levels he possesses beyond 8th.</p>

      <p><strong>Warp Mastery (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the incanter
      quadruples the distance he may teleport. This also affects his shift
      power, and he may use shift as a free action.</p>
