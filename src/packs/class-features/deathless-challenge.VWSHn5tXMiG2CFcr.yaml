      <p>At 8th level, as long as the sentinel has an active challenge, whenever
      her hit points are 0 or lower but she is not dead, she automatically
      stabilizes and can act as though she was disabled instead of dying. While
      disabled, she is not staggered, although she still takes 1 damage for
      making a standard action. The sentinel adds her Wisdom score to her
      Constitution when determining her death threshold, even while not making a
      challenge.</p>
