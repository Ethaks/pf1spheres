      <p>A warden of urgency is a manipulator of space and reality, commonly in
      an attempt to ensure that they are always by their allies&#8217; side.
      These wardens are experts in manipulating and distorting the battlefield,
      teleporting into battle and distorting reality around them.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Warp</p>

      <p><strong>Urgent Guard:</strong> An urgent warden&#8217;s guard feels
      strange and sudden. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a
      miss chance equal to 5 x the warden&#8217;s guard bonus. Additionally, as
      part of beginning his guard, the warden may teleport the guarded ally up
      to 10 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Distorting Patrol:</strong> At 7th level, the warden may spend
      a spell point when using his patrol ability to cause time and space to
      distort and shift. Whenever an enemy within the warden&#8217;s area of
      patrol would attempt to cast a spell or use a sphere ability that has a
      range greater than touch, the enemy reduces the range of the spell by 20
      feet, plus 10 feet at 10th level and every 4 class levels thereafter
      (minimum 10 feet). If a spell would have no valid targets due to this, the
      spell fails, keeping any spell points spent. If the warden would
      reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he can apply this
      ability without spending a spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Warp Beacon:</strong> At 11th level, allies benefiting from the
      warden&#8217;s guard that are within his guard range may spend a swift
      action to immediately teleport to an adjacent unoccupied square to the
      warden. If the ally is beyond the warden&#8217;s guard range, the ally
      must instead spend a full-round action and have the warden spend a spell
      point to teleport to his side.</p>

      <p><strong>Reality Burst:</strong> At 15th level, the warden may spend a
      spell point when using his patrol ability to cause those within it to
      buckle and warp. Whenever an enemy would end their turn within the
      warden&#8217;s area of patrol, they must succeed at a Will saving throw or
      be teleported up to 20 feet in a square of the warden&#8217;s choice
      (otherwise following the normal Warp sphere teleport rules). If the warden
      would reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he can apply
      this ability without spending a spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Boundless Vanguard:</strong> At 19th level, whenever a guarded
      ally would be successfully attacked (as long as the warden is aware of the
      attack), the warden may spend a spell point as an immediate action or by
      expending an attack of opportunity to instantly teleport in front of the
      guarded ally, suffering the damage instead of his guarded ally (with
      resistances and damage reduction applying normally).</p>

      <p>Additionally, the warden and his guarded allies may use his warp beacon
      vigil ability regardless of whether or not they are within his guard
      range, and may be used regardless of whether or not the warden and the
      guarded ally are on the same plane or not.</p>

      <p><em>Special:</em> If the warden is using the custodian archetype and
      possesses the Eternal Guardian class feature, he does not need to spend a
      spell point when using this vigil ability.</p>

      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc82"><span>Boon of Extrication (requires urgency, Warp sphere)
      [AoP2]</span></h4>

      <p>The warden gains the Imbue Teleport Warp talent as a bonus talent. If
      the warden imbues a teleport on a guarded ally, it lasts for as long as
      the guarded ally is guarded.</p>

      <h4 id="toc83"><span>Desperate Shift (requires urgency, warden 4, Warp
      sphere) [AoP2]</span></h4>

      <p>As part of beginning his guard, the warden may expend an attack of
      opportunity to teleport his guarded ally or himself up to 20 feet, plus 5
      feet per 5 warden levels you possess.</p>
