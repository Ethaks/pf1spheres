      <p>Through the absorption of countless creatures' blood, the crimson
      dancer becomes an unrelenting physiological entity. At 11th level, the
      crimson dancer ceases to age, and no longer suffers any penalties or gains
      any benefits related to her age and she cannot be magically aged. Due to
      her precise control over her body&#8217;s makeup, she can appear as any
      age she would like, and can change her apparent age as a swift action
      (this does not affect her size category).</p>
