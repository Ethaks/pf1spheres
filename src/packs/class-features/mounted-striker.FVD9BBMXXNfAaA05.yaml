      <p>The striker gains the Beastmastery sphere as a bonus talent and Mounted
      Athlete as a bonus feat, even if she does not have the prerequisites
      normally required for this feat.</p>

      <p>In addition, the striker may treat her mount&#8217;s movement as though
      it were her own movement for the purposes of the maneuvering momentum
      ability. Whenever the striker would use a striker ability that affects her
      movement, such as the light step or speed step tension technique, the
      striker may grant that ability&#8217;s benefits to her mount instead.</p>
