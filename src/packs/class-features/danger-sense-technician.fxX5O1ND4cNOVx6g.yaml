    value: >
      <p>At 3rd level, a technician gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid
      traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. In
      addition, he gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being
      surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 technician levels
      thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap
      sense for the purpose of any feat or class prerequisite. The bonuses
      gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (from
      another class).</p>
