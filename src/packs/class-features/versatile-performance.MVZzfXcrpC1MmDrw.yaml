      <p>The troubadour can choose one type of Perform skill. He can use his
      bonus in that skill in place of his bonus in associated skills. When
      substituting in this way, the troubadour uses his total Perform skill
      bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated
      skill&#8217;s bonus, whether or not he has ranks in that skill or if it is
      a class skill. When the troubadour selects this actor training, he may
      immediately retrain any ranks he possesses in the replaced skills.</p>

      <p>The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Act (Bluff,
      Disguise), Comedy (Bluff, Intimidate), Dance (Acrobatics, Fly), Keyboard
      Instruments (Diplomacy, Intimidate), Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive),
      Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String
      (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).</p>

      <p>This actor training can be taken once at 2nd level and once every 4
      levels thereafter, choosing a different Perform skill each time.</p>
