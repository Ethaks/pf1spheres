    value: >
      <p>When spending a move action to move as part of rapid assault, the
      armiger may divide her movement up between the triggering action and the
      granted bonus attacks. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as
      normal. Additionally, if she does not have a move action available, the
      armiger may still move up to her speed as if she spent a move action.
      Doing so makes the armiger staggered on her next turn even if she would
      normally be immune to the staggered condition.</p>
