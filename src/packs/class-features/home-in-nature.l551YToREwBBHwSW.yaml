      <p>The shifter gains a favored terrain, as the ranger class feature. She
      may select this trait once at 2nd level, plus an additional time for every
      4 shifter levels she possesses beyond 2nd. Each time this trait is gained
      beyond the first, she gains an additional favored terrain, and the bonuses
      granted in one of her favored terrains (even the one just selected if she
      desires) increases by 2.</p>
