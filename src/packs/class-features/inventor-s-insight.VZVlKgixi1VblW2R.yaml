      <p>The technician may create one extra invention with no more than 1
      improvement. Alternately, he may add 1 additional improvement to one of
      his other inventions. If he dismantles this invention, he may create a new
      invention with 1 improvement, or choose another invention to gain +1
      improvement. This insight may be selected multiple times. The effects do
      not stack. Each time this insight is gained, the technician may create a
      new invention with only 1 improvement, or choose a different invention to
      gain a bonus improvement.</p>
