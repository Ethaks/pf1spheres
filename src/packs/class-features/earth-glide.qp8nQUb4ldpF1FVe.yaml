      <p>The shifter gains earth glide. She can pass through stone, dirt, or
      almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims
      through water. If protected against fire damage, she may glide through
      lava. She leaves behind no tunnel, hole, ripple, or any other sign of her
      presence.</p>
