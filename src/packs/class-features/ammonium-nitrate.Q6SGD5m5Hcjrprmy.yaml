      <p>Advanced research into various chemical reactions has taught the
      scholar how to create a substance that can drastically lower temperatures,
      or even freeze an opponent solid. The scholar may activate this imposition
      in two ways:</p>

      <p>First, she may use it to lower the ambient temperature in an area,
      protecting herself and every creature within 30 ft. from the effects of
      extreme heat, such as heat exhaustion and nonlethal damage for 10 minutes;
      this cooling effect can even protect the scholar and her allies from the
      heat of lava, cooling molten stone within the radius of the effect and
      allowing the scholar and her allies to safely traverse it. Creatures
      within the radius of this effect also gain fire resistance equal to the
      scholar&#8217;s class level, or increase any fire resistance they
      currently possess by the same amount.</p>

      <p>Secondly, she may make a single ranged touch attack against an opponent
      within 30 ft.; on a successful attack the opponent takes 1d8 cold damage
      for every five class levels the scholar possesses (rounded down, minimum
      1d8), and must make a Fortitude save or be frozen solid in a block of ice
      for 1 round, plus 1 round per class level. (this ability can affect
      objects and undead). While trapped in the ice, the creature is paralyzed
      but does not need to eat or breathe for the duration of the effect, and
      any physical attack or damaging spell deals damage to the ice first and
      cannot harm the trapped creature until the ice is destroyed, which ends
      all other effects of this ability. The ice has 20 hit points and hardness
      0.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Glacial Percussion [explosive]:</strong> Mixing various
      freezing compounds into her flashbangs, the scholar allows them to deal an
      additional 1d6 cold damage per two class levels she possesses, and
      creatures that fail their Fortitude save are staggered for 1d4 rounds in
      addition to the flashbang&#8217;s normal effects. If the scholar hits a
      target that is already staggered with this effect, the target is instead
      paralyzed for 1 round.</li>

      </ul>
