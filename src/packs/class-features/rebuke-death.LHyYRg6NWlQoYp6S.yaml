    value: >
      <p>At 19th level, when the thaumaturge is reduced to 0 hit points or
      fewer, the thaumaturge may use two of his remaining invocations to instead
      be reduced to 1 hit point. Effects that kill the thaumaturge outright
      without dealing hit point damage are not affected by this ability.</p>

      <h2 id="toc19"><span>Occult Knowledge</span></h2>

      <p>At 2nd level, a thaumaturge gains a +1 bonus to all Knowledge checks,
      Spellcraft checks, and Use Magic Device checks. This bonus increases by 1
      for every 4 additional thaumaturge levels possessed, to a maximum of +5 at
      18th level.</p>

      <h2 id="toc20"><span>Bonus Feats</span></h2>

      <p>At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a thaumaturge gains a bonus
      feat. This may be spent to gain an extra magic talent, or any feat which
      has casting as a prerequisite (item creation feats, metamagic feats,
      Sphere Focus, Circle Casting, etc.).</p>

      <h2 id="toc21"><span>Master Invoker</span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level, the thaumaturge selects two invocations other than
      rebuke death; he may use these invocations at will without using one of
      his invocations per day.</p>
