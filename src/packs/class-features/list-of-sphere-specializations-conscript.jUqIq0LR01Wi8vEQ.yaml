      <h3 id="toc35"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/alchemy">Alchemy</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Chemical Specialization (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level,
      whenever the conscript throws an alchemical splash weapon and misses, he
      may select the square in which the splash weapon lands rather than
      rolling. Whenever an alchemical item created by the conscript would heal a
      creature&#8217;s hit points, any healing in excess of the creature&#8217;s
      maximum hit points is applied as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour
      per conscript class level.</p>

      <p>In addition, the conscript learns how to create an antivenom for any
      poison he can obtain a sample of. He can prepare such an antivenom in 1
      minute; if the conscript has a poison prepared from the alchemy sphere, he
      can convert it into an antivenom as a full-round action.</p>

      <p>Whenever the conscript confirms a critical with a poisoned weapon, the
      DC of the poison is increased by +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Masterful Chemistry (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the
      conscript doubles the number of formulae he can have prepared at any one
      time, and the conscript also gains a +1 to the DCs of their Alchemy sphere
      poisons.</p>

      <p><strong>Master Alchemist (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the conscript
      doubles the affected area of any splash or burst items he uses; effects
      that normally only affect a single target instead affect all targets
      within 5 ft. of the point of impact, splash damage affects all creatures
      within 10 ft. instead of 5 ft., etc. In addition, the conscript may apply
      any poison in his possession to a wielded weapon as a free action, and
      each dose of poison applied to a weapon lasts for 1 additional attack.</p>

      <h3 id="toc36"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/athletics">Athletics</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Expert Climber (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, the
      conscript gains a climb speed of 20 ft. If he has or gains a climb speed
      from another source, he instead increases his climb speed by 10 ft.
      (unless that would make his total climb speed less than 20 ft.). Whenever
      he climbs and uses another movement mode in the same round, treat his
      speed for both movement modes as being equal to his greatest movement
      speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Uncanny Swimmer (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the conscript
      gains a swim speed of 30 ft. If he has or gains a swim speed from another
      source, increase that swim speed by 10 ft. instead (unless that would make
      his total swim speed less than 30 ft.). Whenever the conscript swims and
      uses another movement mode in the same round, treat his speed for both
      movement modes as being equal to his greatest movement speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Athletic Paragon (Ex):</strong> Upon reaching 20th level, the
      conscript has achieved the peak of physical fitness. Increase the total
      speed of any movement mode he possesses by 10 ft. (this is applied after
      any modifications or bonuses gained from the expert climber or uncanny
      swimmer class features). In addition, he gains a competence bonus to
      Fortitude and Reflex saving throws equal to his practitioner modifier, and
      he does not suffer any penalties to his physical ability scores (Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution) due to aging. Any penalties that have accrued
      due to age prior to this point are removed.</p>

      <h3 id="toc37"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/barrage">Barrage</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Always Ready (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the conscript gains a
      +2 bonus to his initiative rolls and the first damage roll he makes during
      combat. If his hands are open and he is aware of the enemy, he may draw a
      ranged weapon as part of making his initiative roll.</p>

      <p><strong>Startling Barrage (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a
      conscript successfully attacks an unaware creature with a ranged or thrown
      weapon, that creature remains flat-footed until the beginning of their
      next round.</p>

      <p><strong>Barrage Beast (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript strikes a target at least twice during a barrage, he deals an
      additional +4d6 points of precision damage on each attack after the first;
      this stacks with precision damage from other sources, such as a
      rogue&#8217;s sneak attack.</p>

      <h3 id="toc38"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/barroom">Barroom</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Broken Creativity (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript can
      deal either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage with an improvised
      weapon, and while drunk a conscript deals additional damage with an
      improvised weapon equal to 1/3 his base attack bonus (minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Lasting Drunkenness (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a
      conscript expends his drunk status, he is still treated as though he had
      the drunk status for the purpose of talents which would grant him benefits
      for having it for 1 minute. In addition, he gains a +2 dodge bonus to his
      armor class and a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws while
      drunk. At 16th level, these bonuses increase by +2.</p>

      <p><strong>Eternal Drunk (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the conscript is
      always treated as though he had the &#8216;drunk&#8217; status for the
      purpose of talents which would grant benefits for having it, and all
      improvised weapons he wields are always treated as 2 size categories
      larger than they actually are for the purpose of determining how much
      damage they deal.</p>

      <h3 id="toc39"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/beastmastery">Beastmastery</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Companion Creature (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript
      gains the Beastmastery sphere Animal Companion talent twice, giving the
      conscript a full progression animal companion. In addition, the conscript
      can use Handle Animal in place of Knowledge (nature) to identify creatures
      with the animal type, or use Ride if the animal would be a suitable
      mount.</p>

      <p><strong>Nature&#8217;s Friend (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, creatures of
      the animal type have a starting attitude toward the conscript one step
      better than normal, to a maximum of friendly. Whenever the conscript
      attempts a Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check against a
      creature that is the same type of creature as their mount or animal
      companion, they receive a competence bonus on the check equal to 1/2 their
      class level (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Beast Master (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript is
      always treated as though they rolled a natural 20 when making a Handle
      Animal, Knowledge (nature), or Ride check. In addition the conscript gains
      one of the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Any creature the conscript is mounted on gains gains fast healing 5
      and a competence bonus to AC, combat maneuver defense, and all saving
      throws equal to half the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus.</li>

      <li>The conscript&#8217;s mount or animal companion improves any armor
      proficiency it may have by one step (non-proficient to light, light to
      medium, medium to heavy), and gains a competence bonus on damage rolls and
      saving throws equal to 1/2 the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus as long
      as it has line of sight to the conscript. Whenever the conscript takes
      damage from an attack while his mount or animal companion is in line of
      sight, his mount or animal companion may move up to its maximum base speed
      directly towards the conscript as an immediate action.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 id="toc40"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/berserker">Berserker</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Iron Rage (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a conscript
      takes a penalty to their AC from the Berserker sphere, they also gain DR
      1/- for 1 round. At 5th level and every five levels afterwards, this DR
      increases by 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Steel Rage (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a conscript
      gains temporary hit points from the Berserker sphere ability, they gain an
      additional number of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 their conscript
      level.</p>

      <p><strong>Adamantine Rage (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a
      conscript takes a penalty to their AC from a Berserker sphere ability,
      they treat all creatures as battered for as long as the penalty lasts.</p>

      <h3 id="toc41"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/brute">Brute</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Mighty Flex (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a conscript
      successfully executes a bull rush, drag, reposition, or overrun combat
      maneuver while he has martial focus, he may attempt a grapple or trip
      combat maneuver as an attack of opportunity (this attempt does not provoke
      an attack of opportunity itself). The conscript cannot attempt a grapple
      check in this manner unless the opponent is within his natural reach (for
      example, if the conscript triggered this ability by making a bull rush
      attempt against a target he chose not to move with, he could only use the
      trip option of this ability).</p>

      <p><strong>Never Outmatched (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, the conscript
      ignores the size bonus to a creature&#8217;s combat maneuver bonus and CMD
      when performing or resisting a bull rush, drag, reposition, or overrun
      combat maneuver.</p>

      <p><strong>Giant Physique (Ex):</strong> When the conscript reaches 20th
      level, he gains a +4 bonus to his CMB and CMD when performing or defending
      against a bull rush, pull, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver. In
      addition, the conscript doubles his critical threat range when performing
      a shove or a bull rush, pull, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver that
      deals damage.</p>

      <p><em>Author's Note:</em> Combat Maneuvers cannot critically hit normally
      (they "succeed" on a natural 20). The Giant Physique ability allows them
      to critically hit on a natural 20 (doubled to 19-20 by the ability),
      rolling to confirm the critical hit against the target's CMD. The critical
      threat range of a combat maneuver augmented with this ability is 20 and
      multiplier is x2. If you possess an ability that allows you to use a
      weapon to perform the action or maneuver, you may use that weapon's
      critical threat range and multiplier instead.</p>

      <h3 id="toc42"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/boxing">Boxing</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Raw Knuckle (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a conscript
      uses his counter punch ability, he deals an additional +2 damage. At 6th
      level and every six levels afterwards, this additional damage increases by
      +2.</p>

      <p><strong>Lights Out (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a conscript
      makes a successful attack using his counter punch ability, the creature he
      damaged with it treats the conscript as though he had concealment for 1
      round. At 16th level, he is instead treated as though he had total
      concealment.</p>

      <p><strong>Impossible Preparation (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, as long as
      a conscript has an action readied, he is immune to being moved or
      teleported (he may choose to allow himself to be moved or teleported if he
      wishes) and may roll two times whenever he is required to make a Will
      saving throw, taking the most favorable result.</p>

      <h3 id="toc43"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/dual-wielding">Dual Wielding</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Perfect Ambidexterity (Ex):</strong> From 3rd level on, the
      conscript reduces all penalties taken for two-weapon fighting or attacking
      with a main hand and off-hand weapon using the Dual Wielding sphere by 1
      (so a conscript wielding at least one light weapon will only take a -1
      penalty for dual wielding, and a conscript wielding two one-handed weapons
      would take a -3 penalty for dual wielding). This reduction applies after
      any other effects that reduce the conscript&#8217;s dual wielding
      penalties, such as the Balanced Blows talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Rending Strikes:</strong> At 8th level, a conscript gains
      Two-Weapon Rend as a bonus feat, even if he would not normally qualify for
      it. Whenever the conscript rolls maximum damage on his rend damage dice
      (normally this means rolling a 10 on 1d10), the target of his attack is
      sickened for a number of rounds equal to his practitioner modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Eviscerate (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript becomes an
      expert at cutting his foes apart with his perfectly paired weapons;
      whenever the conscript deals damage with his main-hand weapon, his next
      attack with his off-hand weapon is automatically a critical threat as long
      as it successfully hits the target, regardless of the actual roll.</p>

      <h3 id="toc44"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/duelist">Duelist</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Death By A Thousand Cuts (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level,
      a conscript&#8217;s attacks slowly sap away his foe&#8217;s strength.
      Whenever the conscript deals bleed damage to a creature, it must make a
      Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the amount of bleed damage the target is
      suffering due to talents from the Duelist sphere (treat bleed damage in
      form of dice as their minimum roll)) or become fatigued; creatures who are
      already fatigued become exhausted, and exhausted creatures who fail their
      save lose consciousness and fall asleep.</p>

      <p>Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding (but not taking
      bleed damage) awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.
      Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid
      another action). Creatures immune to bleed are immune to all other effects
      of this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Blooded Riposte (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, whenever a
      creature currently taking bleed damage successfully deals damage to a
      conscript with a melee attack, the conscript may make an attack action to
      disarm that creature as an immediate action.</p>

      <p><strong>Exsanguinating Strikes (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the bleed
      damage granted by blooded strike increases to 1d6 + 1d6 per 3 points of
      base attack bonus he possesses. In addition, the conscript&#8217;s attacks
      now ignore immunity to bleed damage; even if the target is not a creature
      with blood or capable of bleeding, his penetrating blows still sap
      whatever force animates the target creature.</p>

      <h3 id="toc45"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/equipment-sphere">Equipment</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Well Equipped (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript gains a
      +1 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls with any weapon with which
      he is proficient; at 10th level, this bonus increases by +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Guarding Gear (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the conscript
      gains a competence bonus to his CMD equal to his practitioner
      modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Well Studied (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a conscript
      rolls to confirm a critical hit with a manufactured weapon, he can roll
      twice and select the better result. While wearing any armor or carrying a
      shield, the conscript is treated as though they had the heavy
      fortification armor special ability.</p>

      <h3 id="toc46"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/fencing">Fencing</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Subtlety (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the conscript treats
      Bluff as a class skill. If he already has Bluff as a class skill, he may
      instead treat any one other skill of his choice as a class skill. In
      addition, the conscript gains a competence bonus on Bluff checks equal to
      1/4 his base attack bonus (minimum +1).</p>

      <p><strong>Agile Defense (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a conscript
      successfully damages a creature with an attack that deals precision
      damage, he gains a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against all attacks from the
      damaged creature for 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Shadowed Defense (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript succeeds at a feint attempt against a creature, he also gains
      concealment against all attacks made by that creature until the start of
      his next turn.</p>

      <h3 id="toc47"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/gladiator">Gladiator</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Armed Intimidator (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever the
      conscript is wielding a weapon with the performance special feature, or
      any weapon from the Gladiator Training discipline, he may add its
      enhancement bonus (if any) to his Intimidate checks.</p>

      <p><strong>Celebrity Combatant (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the
      conscript treats every battle as a performance combat as long as he is
      wielding a weapon with the performance special feature or a weapon from
      the Gladiator Training discipline, treating his allies and other creatures
      participating in the combat as a small, indifferent crowd for the purposes
      of determining what benefits he receives. In addition, whenever he begins
      a performance combat, he starts with a number of victory points equal to
      half his practitioner modifier (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Gladiatorial Weapon Master (Ex):</strong> Once the conscript
      reaches 20th level, whenever he threatens a critical hit with a weapon
      with the performance special feature or any weapon from the Gladiator
      Training discipline, he automatically confirms the critical threat. In
      addition, he is always treated as having the Improved Critical feat for
      any of these weapons.</p>

      <h3 id="toc48"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/guardian">Guardian</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Increased Toughness (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript
      gains 3 hit points. At every following level, he gains an additional hit
      point; these hit points stack with those granted by the Toughness
      feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Increase Defense (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, the amount of
      damage which can be redirected to his delayed damage pool increases to 4 x
      his base attack bonus. If the conscript also has the Greater Delayed
      Damage talent, these bonuses stack.</p>

      <p><strong>Calculated Resistance (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript
      can choose to not empty their pooled damage from the Guardian sphere for
      up to 5 rounds, although if the pooled damage reaches its maximum limit at
      any point, it immediately empties. Any healing the conscript receives also
      removes an equal amount of damage from their pooled damage.</p>

      <h3 id="toc49"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/lancer">Lancer</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Impaling Adept (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript no
      longer takes an attack penalty when attempting to impale a creature.</p>

      <p><strong>Impaling Professional (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, as long as a
      conscript is impaling a creature, that creature cannot take a swift
      action.</p>

      <p><strong>Impaling Monster (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript can
      attempt to impale a creature with any attack he makes, and the impaled
      creature cannot take a move action or expend their martial focus.</p>

      <h3 id="toc50"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/leadership">Leadership</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Cohort Coordination:</strong> At 3rd level and every five
      levels thereafter, a conscript gains a teamwork feat he qualifies for as a
      bonus feat. The conscript may share these feats with any cohort within
      close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 class levels), even if they would not
      normally qualify for it.</p>

      <p><strong>Directed Motion:</strong> At 8th level, the conscript may grant
      an additional move action to a number of cohorts equal to his practitioner
      ability modifier (minimum 1) as a move action. This additional move action
      may only be used to move.</p>

      <p><strong>True Leader:</strong> At 20th level, the conscript&#8217;s
      cohorts gain a morale bonus to AC and all saving throws equal to the
      conscript's practitioner ability modifier and fast healing 5.</p>

      <h3 id="toc51"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/open-hand">Open Hand</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Empty Hand (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, as long as a conscript
      has nothing in any of his hands, he gains a +2 shield bonus to his armor
      class and CMD. At 7th level and every four levels afterwards, this bonus
      increases by +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Empty Fist (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, as long as a conscript
      has nothing in any of his hands, his unarmed strikes are treated as 1 size
      larger to a maximum size of Large. If they would normally be treated as
      Large, he instead gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage for every 4 base
      attack bonus he possesses.</p>

      <p><strong>Empty Soul (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, as long as a conscript
      has nothing in any of his hands, he can add the shield bonus from his
      empty hand class feature to one of his saving throws as a circumstance
      bonus (he can change the saving throw to which this bonus is applied as a
      swift action).</p>

      <h3 id="toc52"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/scoundrel">Scoundrel</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Easy Mark (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript deals damage
      equal to 1/2 his level + his practitioner modifier whenever he
      successfully resolves a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver.</p>

      <p><strong>Brutal Trickster (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever the
      conscript successfully uses a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver, the
      creature affected by it must make a successful Fortitude saving throw or
      be staggered for 1 round. At 16th level, the creature also loses their
      martial focus if they possess it.</p>

      <p><strong>Master Thief (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript makes a successful steal or dirty trick attempt against a
      creature, the next time the conscript forces that creature to make a
      saving throw within 1 minute, they must roll twice and take the worse
      result.</p>

      <h3 id="toc53"><span><span style="color: #993300"><a
      href="/scout">Scout</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Analytical Gaze (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a
      conscript uses his scout ability, he does not take a -5 penalty on the
      Perception check, and his successful use of the scout ability reveals any
      additional information which would be gained by making a successful
      Knowledge check. In addition, the conscript gains a +1 dodge bonus to his
      AC and Reflex saves against any attacks or abilities from a creature he
      has successfully scouted.</p>

      <p><strong>Stealth Surge (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, creatures the
      conscript has successfully scouted take a penalty on all Perception checks
      against him equal to 1/2 the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus. In
      addition, the first time the conscript attacks a scouted creature while it
      is unaware of his presence due to his use of Stealth or a similar ability,
      the conscript automatically treats the base damage dice for his weapon as
      though they had rolled the maximum amount.</p>

      <p><strong>Hidden Death (Ex):</strong> When the conscript reaches 20th
      level, the first time he attacks a scouted creature while it is unaware of
      his presence due to his use of Stealth or a similar ability, the creature
      must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the conscript&#8217;s base
      attack bonus + the ability modifier used for the triggering attack roll)
      or die. Regardless of whether or not the save is made, the target is
      immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.</p>

      <p><strong>Shielded Adept (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript may
      treat heavy and tower shields as light weapons, and decreases the armor
      check penalty of any shield he wields by 1. In addition, bucklers are
      treated as heavy shields when determining how much damage they deal.</p>

      <p><strong>Shield Striker (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, a conscript&#8217;s
      first use of active defense each round does not require him to expend an
      attack of opportunity, and he adds his shield bonus to his Reflex
      saves.</p>

      <p><strong>Shielded Defender (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript
      carrying a shield gains the benefits of heavy fortification, and the
      hardness of any shield he wields is increased by an amount equal to his
      practitioner modifier.</p>

      href="/sniper">Sniper</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Precision Shots (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the conscript may
      use a move action to aim his weapon, gaining a competence bonus on damage
      rolls with his next ranged attack equal to 1/2 his base attack bonus
      (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Uncanny Accuracy (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a
      conscript makes a successful attack while using the deadly shot ability,
      he treats any weapon damage dice roll of 1 or 2 as 3.</p>

      <p><strong>Perfect Aim (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a conscript
      makes a successful attack while using the deadly shot ability, all weapon
      damage dice added by this ability are maximized.</p>

      href="/tech">Tech</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Tech Specialization (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level,
      increase the conscript&#8217;s maximum charge pool size by his
      practitioner ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Masterful Machinery (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the
      conscript increases the number of crafted gadgets he can have prepared at
      any one time by his practitioner ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Master Technician (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the conscript
      may craft a gadget from the Tech sphere to be permanent. While
      unactivated, permanent devices gain charges at the rate of 1 per hour. The
      conscript may only have one permanent device at a time, if the conscript
      has already reached this limit and wishes to create a new permanent
      device, he must select one of his existing permanent devices to
      dismantle.</p>

      href="/trap">Trap</a></span></span></h3>

      <p><strong>Surprising Activation (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a
      creature fails a save against a conscript&#8217;s trap, they are
      flat-footed until the beginning of their next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Engineering Genius (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, a
      conscript&#8217;s dart traps extend to medium range and his snare traps
      double their normal area.</p>

      <p><strong>Enduring Trapper (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a
      conscript&#8217;s traps do not break when activated, resetting after 1
      round. Each time they are activated, they lose 5 rounds of their duration
      (if a trap&#8217;s duration would be measured in minutes, it instead loses
      5 minutes each time it is activated), breaking when their duration would
      expire. Traps that contain expendable items such as alchemical items still
      expend the item upon usage, but may be pre-loaded with additional items,
      in which case a new one is loaded when the trap resets.</p>

      <p><strong>Born Leader:</strong> At 3rd level and every five levels
      thereafter, a conscript gains a teamwork feat he qualifies for as a bonus
      feat. The conscript may share these feats with any ally currently
      benefiting from one of his tactics or shouts, even if they would not
      normally qualify for it.</p>

      <p><strong>Triumphant Stand (Ex):</strong> Starting at 8th level, whenever
      a conscript would be dropped to 0 or fewer hit points by a melee or ranged
      weapon attack while he has a tactic active, any ally currently benefiting
      from the tactic may make an aid another check as an immediate action to
      add +2 to the conscript&#8217;s AC (to a maximum bonus of +10). If these
      bonuses would be enough to raise his AC above the attack roll for the
      triggering attack, the attack is instead treated as a miss and he takes no
      damage from it.</p>

      <p><strong>Concerted Finish (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a
      conscript confirms a critical hit against a creature, each ally currently
      benefiting from one of the conscript&#8217;s tactics or shouts may make a
      single attack against the target as an immediate action. This attack may
      be made with a melee or ranged weapon, but the ally must be threatening
      the creature to make a melee attack, or have a ranged weapon in hand and
      ready to fire in order to make a ranged attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Mobile Grappler (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever the
      conscript makes a successful grapple check to maintain a grapple, he may
      move himself and the grappled creature up to 5 ft. as a free action; this
      movement is in addition to the movement normally granted by using the move
      option available whenever he maintains a grapple. At 9th level and again
      at 15th level, he may move himself and that creature an additional 5
      ft.</p>

      <p><strong>Bear Hug (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever the conscript
      makes a successful grapple check to maintain a grapple, that creature must
      make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 conscript level +
      conscript&#8217;s Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or
      become fatigued for 1 round and lose their martial focus if they possess
      it. At 15th level, they are instead exhausted for 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Fatal Clutch (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript maintains a grapple against a creature, the grappled creature
      must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 conscript level +
      conscript&#8217;s Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or
      take damage equal to 1/4 of their maximum hit points (rounded down).</p>
