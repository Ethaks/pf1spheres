      <p>At 9th level, a sentinel can use mental and physical resiliency to
      avoid certain attacks. If she makes a Fortitude or Will saving throw
      against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she
      instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless sentinel does not gain the
      benefit of the stalwart ability.</p>
