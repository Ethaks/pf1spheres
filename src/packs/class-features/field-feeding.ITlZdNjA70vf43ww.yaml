    value: >
      <p>The commander can make a single DC 20 Survival check to move at full
      overland speed while foraging and supply enough food to feed himself and
      up to 10 Medium humanoids per class level for 1 day. If the commander is
      not traveling overland, he can instead scavenge the same amount of food
      with an hour&#8217;s time. For every 5 points by which the commander
      exceeds the DC for this check, each creature fed by this ability gains a
      +1 morale bonus to damage rolls and Fortitude saves (maximum +5) for the
      next 24 hours.</p>
