      <p>Every non-base persona a troubadour possesses its own unique abilities,
      based upon what trope that persona falls into, and as the troubadour steps
      into those roles, he acquires those abilities. Each persona may possess
      only one trope. If the troubadour gains a skill rank, feat, or talent as
      part of his base persona that was also granted to him by a persona, he may
      immediately replace that skill rank, feat, or talent on the non-base
      persona.</p>

      <p>Each trope grants a trope benefit at 1st level, as well as access to a
      list of persona quirks. Each persona gains one persona quirk of the
      troubadour&#8217;s choice at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter from
      those granted by its trope or tropes. Unless specified otherwise, a
      persona quirk cannot be granted to the same persona more than once.</p>

      <p>Tropes are listed at the end of this page.</p>
