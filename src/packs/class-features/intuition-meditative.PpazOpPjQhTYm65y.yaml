      <p>The technician&#8217;s intuition pool increases by 1, and counts as a
      ki pool when meeting the prerequisites for feats. In addition to other
      uses of intuition, he may spend a point to grant himself a +20 enhancement
      bonus to speed for 1 round, a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round, or a +20
      bonus on a single Acrobatics check made to jump. An intuition pool counts
      as a supernatural ability when used in these ways.</p>

      <p>A technician must have the intuition technical insight to select this
      insight.</p>
