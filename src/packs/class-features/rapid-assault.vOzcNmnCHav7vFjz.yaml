    value: >
      <p>Starting at 5th level, the armiger becomes an expert at rapidly
      integrating multiple weapons into her attack routines. Whenever the
      armiger successfully damages a creature or succeeds on a combat maneuver
      while using the attack action with a customized weapon, she may expend
      martial focus as a swift action to make an additional attack against that
      creature at her highest base attack bonus. This attack takes a -2 penalty
      on the attack roll and can only be taken with a customized weapon other
      than the one used in the triggering attack. At 10th level and every five
      levels thereafter, the armiger may make an additional attack, as long as
      each previous attack was successful, using a different customized weapon
      each time and increasing the attack penalty by 2 each time. The armiger
      cannot use the same weapon twice in the same attack sequence with this
      ability. The armiger may spend a move action to move up to her speed
      between the triggering action and her first additional attack.</p>
