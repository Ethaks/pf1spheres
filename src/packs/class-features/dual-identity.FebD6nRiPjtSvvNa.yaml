      <p>From 1st level on, the conscript is trained in techniques to hide his
      true identity, allowing him to move about disparate social circles without
      carrying the stigma of his actions or acquaintances. In effect, the
      conscript has two identities: one is a polite member of society while the
      other is a skilled and cunning warrior. To keep up this charade, the
      conscript usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company,
      and his secret identity name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those
      who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about
      the other, unless the conscript&#8217;s true identity is revealed to the
      world at large.</p>

      <p>The conscript can start each day in either of his identities, referred
      to simply as social or secret. Changing from one identity to another takes
      1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve
      the conscript&#8217;s secret.</p>

      <p>Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing
      (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves
      applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects.
      Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items
      such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the
      user&#8217;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change
      identities.</p>

      <p>Despite being a single person, the conscript&#8217;s dual nature allows
      him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an
      identity, he is treated as having that identity&#8217;s alignment for all
      spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose
      of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only
      eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements.</p>

      <p>A conscript&#8217;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from
      each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a conscript with a
      lawful neutral social identity could have a secret identity that is lawful
      good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil.
      If a conscript is the target of an effect that would change his alignment,
      it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>

      <p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the conscript work only if the
      conscript is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to
      locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same
      individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing
      nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>
