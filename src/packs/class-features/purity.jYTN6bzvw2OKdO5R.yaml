      <p>A warden of purity is one of zealous belief and vigilance, acting as a
      guiding beacon of morality. These wardens are fiercely dedicated, and
      focus around the swift slaying of those who would dare pose a threat to
      themselves or their allies.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Light</p>

      <p><strong>Radiant Guard:</strong> A purifying warden&#8217;s guard is
      made entirely of light. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guard may, as a
      free action, shed bright light for 15 feet, and increase the light level
      by one step to a maximum of normal for 15 feet beyond this. This light can
      be dismissed as a free action. The guarded allies also gain a circumstance
      bonus to Perception and Sense Motive checks equal to twice the
      warden&#8217;s guard bonus.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Strike:</strong> At 7th level, the warden chooses an end
      of the alignment spectrum that he possesses (chaotic, evil, good, or
      lawful), or choosing one of these options if he is true neutral. Once this
      choice is chosen, it cannot be changed. The warden&#8217;s guarded allies
      deal an additional 1d6 points of untyped damage with all weapon damage
      rolls, except against creatures who possess the chosen alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Smite the Tainted:</strong> At 11th level, the warden can spend
      a spell point as a swift action to make a declaration to slay a creature
      within his guard range. The warden must choose one ally that he can see
      within his guard range to benefit from this ability. The chosen creature
      gains a +4 sacred bonus on damage rolls against the target, in addition to
      treating their attacks as being cold iron and silver for the purposes of
      bypassing damage reduction. The warden may only affect one enemy at a time
      with this ability, and lasts for 1 minute, or until the warden chooses a
      different creature.</p>

      <p><strong>Cleansing Light:</strong> At 15th level, the warden can spend a
      spell point when using patrol to bathe his area of patrol in cleansing
      light. All creatures within the warden&#8217;s area of patrol may attempt
      a new saving throw against any ongoing effect they are currently suffering
      from that normally grants a saving throw using the original DC, even if
      they have already failed the initial save and would not normally be
      granted another. Poison and disease effects that would worsen on a failed
      saving throw do not count this saving throw as a failure when determining
      such effects if it is unsuccessful.</p>

      <p><strong>Pure Form:</strong> At 19th level, the warden may spend 2 spell
      points when using his guard ability to transform the guarded ally into a
      being of purity. The warden may only have a single guarded ally benefiting
      from this ability at one time. While benefiting from this ability, the
      guarded ally gains immunity to bleed, death effects, disease, nonlethal
      damage, paralysis, poison, and stunning, in addition to shedding bright
      light in a 40-foot-radius, and increasing the light level by one step to a
      maximum of normal for 40 feet beyond this.</p>

      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc67"><span>Stalwart Radiance (requires purity, warden
      12)</span></h4>

      <p>Whenever the warden or one of his guarded allies would succeed at a
      Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a partial effect
      on a successful save, they instead avoid the effect entirely.</p>
