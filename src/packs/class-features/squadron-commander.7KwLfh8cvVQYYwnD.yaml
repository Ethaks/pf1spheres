      <p>Starting at 1st level, and again at 10th and 18th level, the conscript
      gains 1 squadron feat for which he qualifies as a bonus feat. For the
      purpose of squadron feat abilities and effects, the conscript has a
      minimum War caster level equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum 1), using
      his practitioner modifier as his casting ability modifier. In place of
      spending a spell point when using squadron feat abilities and effects, he
      may expend his martial focus. After any rest of 8 hours or longer, the
      conscript may choose to retrain the squadron feats granted by this ability
      for any other squadron feat he qualifies for.</p>
