    value: >
      <p>At 4th level, the soul weaver may expend one soul to commune with the
      spirit world, allowing her to speak with and question the ancestral dead.
      This allows her to attempt a single Knowledge check, even if untrained,
      and with an insight bonus equal to her soul weaver level + her casting
      ability modifier. This may be used to reroll a Knowledge check the soul
      weaver had previously failed, but no more than once per question. If the
      soul weaver is touching a body that has been dead for no longer than 1 day
      per level, she may summon and speak with that body&#8217;s spirit for up
      to 1 minute per caster level, which retains all knowledge it had in life
      but is under no obligation to talk or answer any questions.</p>
