      <p>The scholar may use her Intelligence modifier in place of her Wisdom
      modifier as her associated ability score modifier with the Heal skill. In
      addition, the scholar may expend one use of a healer&#8217;s kit and make
      a special DC 15 Heal check on an ally as a standard action that provokes
      an attack of opportunity; if this check is successful, the ally recovers 1
      hit point +1 for each point by which the scholar exceeds the DC. If the
      scholar has at least 5 ranks in the Heal skill, she may instead use this
      ability to restore 1 point of ability damage +1 point for every 5 points
      by which she exceeds this ability&#8217;s DC. The scholar can only attempt
      to heal a particular creature with this ability a number of times per day
      equal to her Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Attempting to heal a creature
      but failing to meet the DC of this ability still counts towards this daily
      total.</p>
