      <p>The armorist adds cyclonic (+2) and seeking (+1) to the list of special
      abilities she can add to bound and summoned weapons. The armorist does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity when making a ranged attack with a weapon
      with either the cyclonic or seeking special abilities.</p>

      <h2 id="toc55"><span>Armor Training (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>Starting at 3rd level, an armorist learns to be more maneuverable while
      wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, she reduces the armor check
      penalty by 1 (minimum 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed
      by her armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, and
      19th) these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum &#8211;5 reduction of the
      armor check penalty and a +5 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus
      allowed.</p>

      <p>In addition, an armorist can also move at her normal speed while
      wearing medium armor. At 7th level, an armorist can move at her normal
      speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>

      <h2 id="toc56"><span>Boost Equipment</span></h2>

      <p>Beginning at 10th level, instead of summoning equipment, the armorist
      may touch a piece of magical equipment and spend a spell point to increase
      its enhancement bonus by half the bonus she may grant to summoned
      equipment (minimum +1). This has the same duration as summoned equipment
      and causes the item to count as summoned equipment for the purpose of
      arsenal tricks. This requires a standard action to boost equipment being
      wielded by another, but can be done with the same action cost as summoning
      equipment if the armorist is already touching or wielding the piece of
      equipment. The armorist must be able to summon a type of equipment
      (weapons, shields, or armor) in order to boost a piece of similar
      equipment.</p>

      <p>Just as with summoned equipment, a boost cannot raise a piece of
      equipment&#8217;s enhancement bonus higher than +5, but can be traded for
      special abilities. Boosting an item a second time replaces the first
      boosting, and pieces of bound equipment cannot be boosted.</p>

      <h2 id="toc57"><span>Quick Summons</span></h2>

      <p>At 15th level, the armorist may summon or switch equipment onto herself
      as an immediate action or free action.</p>

      <h2 id="toc58"><span>Infinite Arsenal (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At level 20, the armorist no longer needs to spend a spell point to
      summon equipment, and the duration of summoned equipment and boosted
      equipment increases to 1 hour per class level.</p>
