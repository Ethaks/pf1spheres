      <p>The mageknight can track creatures by observing the omens and mystic
      signs that subtly mark their passing. She can use Spellcraft instead of
      Survival to both find and follow tracks, using the same DCs listed under
      the Survival skill. In addition, she can track creatures that leave no
      tracks, such as flying and swimming creatures, and creatures using
      trackless step or pass without trace, taking a -5 penalty to her check for
      each such effect they benefit from. Finally, if she finds or follows
      tracks where someone has teleported or moved between planes, she may
      attempt a Spellcraft or Survival check against a DC equal to their MSD to
      determine their destination.</p>

      <p>With a successful check she learns the direction of their destination
      and whether the distance to that destination is near (less than 1 mile),
      moderate (1 mile to 10 miles) or far (greater than 10 miles); if they
      moved between planes she instead learns what plane they moved to.</p>
