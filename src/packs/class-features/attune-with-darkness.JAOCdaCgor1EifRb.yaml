      <p>The sage has learned how to convert their ki into clouds of shadowy
      darkness that feed on his foes. The sage gains the <a
      href="/dark">Dark</a> sphere and the Hungry Darkness talent as bonus
      talents. If the sage already possesses either of these talents, he may
      choose any other Dark sphere talent in its place. Sages with this ability
      are only affected by their (darkness) talents if they choose to be.</p>
