      <p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to deal damage
      with her attacks as if she had the warpriest&#8217;s sacred weapon class
      feature with all her weapons, treating her mageknight level as her
      warpriest level. This works for melee weapons, ranged weapons, and unarmed
      attacks. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to her casting ability
      modifier.</p>
