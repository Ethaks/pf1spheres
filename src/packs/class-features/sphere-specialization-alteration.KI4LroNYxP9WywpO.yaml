      <p><strong>Battleshaping (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter may
      grant himself or a creature under the effects of his shapeshift one trait
      as a swift action. This trait cannot cost a spell point and must be one
      that he can grant through his shapeshift. This trait lasts for 1 round per
      2 incanter levels and if the target so chooses they may resist this effect
      without the need for a saving throw. This trait stacks with polymorph
      effects, including shapeshift.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, the incanter can grant two traits in this fashion. A
      target can only be under the effects of one use of battleshaping at any
      time. The incanter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to
      3 + his casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Change Shape (Sp):</strong> At 8th level, once per day as a
      free action the incanter can grant himself one Alteration talent he does
      not possess for a number of rounds equal to his incanter level. Every time
      this ability is used, he may change this bonus talent to another
      Alteration talent he does not possess. He may use this ability an
      additional time per day for every 6 levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p><strong>Shapeshifter&#8217;s Renewal (Su):</strong> At 20th level,
      whenever the incanter places a shapeshift on a target and spends a spell
      point to maintain it without concentration, he may choose to remove any
      poison and non-magical disease from the target and heal the target 2 hit
      points per incanter level.</p>
