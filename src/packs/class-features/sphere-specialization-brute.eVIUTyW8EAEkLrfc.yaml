      <p><strong>Mighty Flex (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a conscript
      successfully executes a bull rush, drag, reposition, or overrun combat
      maneuver while he has martial focus, he may attempt a grapple or trip
      combat maneuver as an attack of opportunity (this attempt does not provoke
      an attack of opportunity itself). The conscript cannot attempt a grapple
      check in this manner unless the opponent is within his natural reach (for
      example, if the conscript triggered this ability by making a bull rush
      attempt against a target he chose not to move with, he could only use the
      trip option of this ability).</p>

      <p><strong>Never Outmatched (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, the conscript
      ignores the size bonus to a creature&#8217;s combat maneuver bonus and CMD
      when performing or resisting a bull rush, drag, reposition, or overrun
      combat maneuver.</p>

      <p><strong>Giant Physique (Ex):</strong> When the conscript reaches 20th
      level, he gains a +4 bonus to his CMB and CMD when performing or defending
      against a bull rush, pull, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver. In
      addition, the conscript doubles his critical threat range when performing
      a shove or a bull rush, pull, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver that
      deals damage.</p>

      <p><em>Author's Note:</em> Combat Maneuvers cannot critically hit normally
      (they "succeed" on a natural 20). The Giant Physique ability allows them
      to critically hit on a natural 20 (doubled to 19-20 by the ability),
      rolling to confirm the critical hit against the target's CMD. The critical
      threat range of a combat maneuver augmented with this ability is 20 and
      multiplier is x2. If you possess an ability that allows you to use a
      weapon to perform the action or maneuver, you may use that weapon's
      critical threat range and multiplier instead.</p>
