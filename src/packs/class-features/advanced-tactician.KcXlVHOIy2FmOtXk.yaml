      <p>Commanders of at least 10th level may have two enhanced tactics active
      at a time, and may activate or switch both enhanced tactics using the
      largest same action, as long as it is the largest activation action from
      among the two (for example, the commander could activate two enhanced
      tactics that both require a move action as a move action, but an enhanced
      tactic that requires a standard action and an enhanced tactic that
      requires a move action would require a standard action to activate
      together).</p>
