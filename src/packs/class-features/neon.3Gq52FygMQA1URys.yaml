    value: >
      <p>Through advanced research into air, cooling points, and the process of
      turning air into a liquid, the scholar learns how to create a gas that can
      act as a stable source of light. When the scholar first gains this
      imposition she learns how to craft a small neon light that costs 1 hour
      and a total of 50 gp to create. When creating a neon light, the scholar
      may have it be of any colour she chooses, chosen at the time of creation,
      which lasts for 2 hours per class level she possesses. This light sheds
      bright light to a range of up to 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 class levels, and
      increases the light level by one step within twice that range. If the
      scholar possesses the Tech sphere and can create batteries, she may use
      the battery within a neon light to allow it to last as long as the battery
      lasts, to a maximum of 24 hours.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Chromatic Flare [explosive]:</strong> The scholar adds a
      mixture of neon and some incredibly volatile chemicals to her flashbangs.
      Creatures and objects that fail their save against the flashbang&#8217;s
      initial effect are coated in a vibrant colour, taking a -20 penalty to all
      Stealth checks, and does not allow the affected creatures to benefit from
      the concealment normally provided by darkness, invisibility, or the Blur
      talent from the Illusion sphere (or similar effects) for 1 round, plus 1
      round per 4 scholar levels she possesses.</li>
