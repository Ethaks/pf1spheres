    value: >
      <p>Starting at 4th level, a symbiat&#8217;s mental senses let him react to
      danger before his physical senses would normally allow him to do so. He
      cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does he lose his Dexterity bonus to AC
      if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if
      immobilized. A symbiat with this ability can still lose his Dexterity
      bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against
      him.</p>

      <p>If a symbiat already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he
      automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
