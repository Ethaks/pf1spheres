      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s training and practice with tools increases the
      bonus he gets from using masterwork tool kits, such as a set of masterwork
      thieves&#8217; tools; the circumstance bonus granted to the blacksmith by
      such masterwork tools increases by +2, plus an additional +2 at 5th level
      and every 5 levels thereafter (so a 5th level blacksmith using a set of
      masterwork thieves&#8217; tools would receive a +6 circumstance bonus on
      associated checks).</p>
