    value: >
      <p>At 16th level, the symbiat may use telekinesis to grant a target
      unparalleled strength and speed. The symbiat may affect one creature
      within 60 feet, plus an additional creature for every 2 levels beyond
      16th. The targets gain a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity,
      as well as a +30 feet enhancement bonus to their movement speed as long as
      this ability is in effect. When making an attack action or full attack
      action, the creature may make one extra attack with one natural or
      manufactured weapon. The attack is made using the creature&#8217;s full
      base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. This
      extra attack is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided
      by a speed weapon or the Improved Haste Time talent.</p>
