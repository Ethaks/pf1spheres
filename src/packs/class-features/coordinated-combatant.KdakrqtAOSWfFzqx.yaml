    value: >
      <p>Starting at 1st level, and again at 8th level, the conscript gains 1
      teamwork feat for which he qualifies as a bonus feat. All of the
      conscript&#8217;s allies are treated as if they possessed the same
      teamwork feats for the purpose of determining whether the conscript
      receives a bonus from his teamwork feats. His allies do not receive any
      bonuses from this feat unless they actually possess the feat themselves.
      The allies&#8217; positioning and actions must still meet the
      prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the conscript to receive the
      listed bonus. After any rest of 8 hours or longer, the conscript may
      choose to retrain the teamwork feats granted by this ability for any other
      teamwork feat he qualifies for.</p>
