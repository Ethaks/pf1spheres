      <p>The sage gains the ability to channel the damage and other effects of
      chi gong through any melee weapon he is wielding rather than just unarmed
      or natural attacks. If the sage possesses the ki blaster esoteric
      training, he may apply the weapon&#8217;s enhancement bonus and any of its
      other special abilities (such as keen, flaming, or seeking) to the ki
      blast. When applying bonuses to a ki blast, the sage may only transfer
      special abilities which could be applied to a ranged attack which deals
      the same type of damage as the ki blast.</p>
