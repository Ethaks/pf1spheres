    value: >
      <p>The sage treats his class level as his base attack bonus when
      calculating his combat maneuver bonus and combat maneuver defense. This
      stacks with base attack bonus gained from other classes. If the sage has
      the infuser esoteric training package and this esotery, he may spend a ki
      point as an immediate action whenever an opponent would succeed on a
      combat maneuver check against him to force the opponent to reroll the
      check, keeping the second result.</p>
