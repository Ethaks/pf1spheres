      <p>Rocky terrain, steep cliffs, and narrow canyons are assets to be
      leveraged, not obstacles to be feared. When fighting or traveling in
      mountain terrain the commander and any ally affected by one of his tactics
      or shouts gain a competence bonus to their AC against ranged attacks equal
      to the greater of the commander&#8217;s Charisma or Intelligence modifiers
      (minimum +1), increase their base climb speed by 10 ft. (or gain a climb
      speed of 10 ft. if they do not already have one), and gain a bonus on
      Climb and Survival checks equal to 1/2 the commander&#8217;s class
      level.</p>
