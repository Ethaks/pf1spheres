      <p><strong>Requires:</strong> At least 1 combat talent not from the
      Alchemy, Equipment, Tech, or Trap sphere; Knowledge of Many Shapes class
      feature</p>

      <p>When the shifter applies a shapeshift to herself, she may spend an
      additional spell point to gain a combat talent she doesn&#8217;t currently
      possess (excluding the Alchemy, Equipment, Tech, or Trap sphere). She must
      possess the base sphere associated with the talent in order to gain it.
      This talent lasts for 1 minute or until she applies a new shapeshift to
      yourself.</p>
