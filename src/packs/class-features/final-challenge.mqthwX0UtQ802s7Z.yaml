      <p>At 20th level, a sentinel cannot die while she has an active challenge
      against a creature she considers an enemy, regardless of her hit points.
      She can still be killed by death effects and other similar abilities, and
      if she would die due to her hit points being too low, she dies immediately
      if she has no active challenges for one turn.</p>
