      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s time at the forge has taught him how to put
      every iota of his mighty frame into each swing of his weapon, resulting in
      truly devastating attacks. When the blacksmith successfully deals damage
      to a creature with a bludgeoning melee weapon while using the attack
      action, the creature must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2
      the blacksmith&#8217;s class level + his Constitution modifier) or be
      stunned for 1 round. The blacksmith must be at least 12th level to learn
      this insight. Regardless of whether a creature passes or fails its save
      against this effect, it cannot be affected by this ability again for 1d4
      rounds.</p>
