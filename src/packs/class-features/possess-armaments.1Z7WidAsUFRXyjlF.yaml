    value: >
      <p>When possessing a weapon, shield, or suit of armor, the wraith may
      automatically grant it the benefit of one enhancement that he possesses
      for the duration of the possession. The object must be a valid target for
      the enhancement. The wraith uses his class level as his caster level to
      determine the effect of this enhancement. This stacks normally with caster
      levels gained from other sources. Any additional spell point cost of the
      enhancement must be paid as usual. Should the Animate Object enhancement
      be used, the wraith may issue commands to the object while possessing
      it.</p>
