      <p>At 5th level, the armiger treats the enhancement bonus of her active
      weapon set as if it were 1 higher. This bonus increases by +1 every four
      levels thereafter, though it cannot cause the total enhancement of the
      weapon to exceed +5. This bonus applies even if the weapon is not
      masterwork or does not already have at least a +1 bonus.</p>
