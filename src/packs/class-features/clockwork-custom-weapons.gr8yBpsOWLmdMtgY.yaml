      <p>You learn how to outfit your weapons with clockwork dials and
      mechanisms that also act as minor supernatural ritual charms. Whenever you
      successfully damage an opponent with one of your customized weapons while
      using a melee attack action, you may expend your martial focus to force
      the opponent to succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your class
      level + your practitioner modifier) or be slowed (as the <a
      href="/time">Time</a> sphere alter time effect) for 1 round.</p>
