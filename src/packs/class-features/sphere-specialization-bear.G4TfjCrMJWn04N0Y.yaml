      <p><strong>Bear Companion (Su):</strong> You gain an animal companion, as
      the druid class feature, treating your incanter levels as druid levels for
      this purpose. This companion must be a bear, and begins with an
      Intelligence of 6.</p>

      <p><strong>Bear Speech (Ex):</strong> You may speak and understand the
      language of bears, and wild bears begin with an attitude of neutral
      towards you instead of unfriendly.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Bear:</strong> At 8th level, you gain the ability to,
      once per day as a full-round action, magically call your bear to your
      side. This ability is the equivalent of a sphere effect. You may use this
      ability once per day at 8th level, plus an additional time per day for
      every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 20th
      level.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, the bear gains the advanced creature template.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, the bear gains spell resistance equal to your incanter
      level + 11.</p>
