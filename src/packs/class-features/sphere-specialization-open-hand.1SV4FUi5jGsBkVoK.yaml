      <p><strong>Empty Hand (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, as long as a conscript
      has nothing in any of his hands, he gains a +2 shield bonus to his armor
      class and CMD. At 7th level and every four levels afterwards, this bonus
      increases by +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Empty Fist (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, as long as a conscript
      has nothing in any of his hands, his unarmed strikes are treated as 1 size
      larger to a maximum size of Large. If they would normally be treated as
      Large, he instead gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage for every 4 base
      attack bonus he possesses.</p>

      <p><strong>Empty Soul (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, as long as a conscript
      has nothing in any of his hands, he can add the shield bonus from his
      empty hand class feature to one of his saving throws as a circumstance
      bonus (he can change the saving throw to which this bonus is applied as a
      swift action).</p>
