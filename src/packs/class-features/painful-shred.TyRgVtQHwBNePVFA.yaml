    value: >
      <p>For a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the blacksmith's level after giving
      a creature&#8217;s armor the broken condition or reducing a
      creature&#8217;s natural armor bonus to 0, the creature is battered and
      takes an amount of damage equal to the 1/2 the blacksmith&#8217;s level +
      the blacksmith&#8217;s practitioner modifier whenever it moves more than 5
      feet. This damage is of the same type as the weapon the blacksmith used to
      sunder the armor or natural armor and bypasses damage reduction in the
      same way.</p>
