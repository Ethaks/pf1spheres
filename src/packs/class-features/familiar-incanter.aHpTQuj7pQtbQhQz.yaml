      <p>The incanter gains a familiar, as the wizard&#8217;s arcane bond
      option, using his incanter levels as wizard levels for this purpose.</p>

      <p>This specialization costs 1 point. If the incanter spends 2
      specialization points, he can instead gain one of the following special
      familiars: Fey Servant or Omnimental Familiar.</p>

      <h5 id="toc11"><span>Fey Servant (2 specialization points)</span></h5>

      <p>The incanter&#8217;s familiar is a special form of fey creature. The
      familiar must be an animal, and its type becomes fey (granting low-light
      vision if not already possessed). Its fey nature is obvious from its
      unusual coloring and features.</p>

      <p>At 4th level, this familiar gains DR/cold iron equal to half his class
      level.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, he gains the Improved Familiar feat, but must select an
      improved familiar of the fey type.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, a number of times per day equal to 3 + his casting
      ability modifier, he may grant his familiar the benefits of any
      (fey-blessing) talent that he activates on himself without paying any
      additional cost. His familiar must be within 30 feet and under the effects
      of his fey-link when the (fey-blessing) talent is used.</p>

      <h5 id="toc12"><span>Omnimental Familiar (2 specialization
      points)</span></h5>

      <p>The familiar becomes an omnimental. The omnimental never gains the
      speak with animals of its kind ability. At 6th level, the incanter may
      determine range, line of effect, and line of sight for his destructive
      blasts from his familiar&#8217;s position instead of his own.</p>
