      <p>Starting at 1st level, the blacksmith becomes particularly adept at
      striking crafted creations in exactly the right place and manner to damage
      them most effectively. When the blacksmith makes an attack action or
      attack of opportunity, he deals an additional 1d6 damage if making a
      successful sunder attempt or if attacking a construct or object (including
      animated objects). This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every two
      levels thereafter. The blacksmith never provokes attacks of opportunity
      for attempting the sunder combat maneuver, and whenever the blacksmith
      chooses to destroy an item held or worn by a creature with a sunder
      attempt any excess damage is applied to the item&#8217;s wielder. The
      blacksmith counts as having the Improved Sunder feat for determining
      prerequisites.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the blacksmith has learned how to swing his weapons in a
      way that shatters scales and claws as easily as manufactured armor and
      weapons. The blacksmith may make a special sunder attempt as an attack
      action, targeting a creature&#8217;s natural armor or natural weapons. If
      the blacksmith chooses to sunder the creature&#8217;s natural armor, on a
      successful check he deals damage to the creature equal to his normal
      weapon damage (bonus damage from thunderous blows is not applied when
      using sunder in this manner) and it takes a penalty to its natural armor
      bonus equal to the number of bonus damage dice granted by his thunderous
      blows class feature; a creature&#8217;s natural armor bonus cannot be
      reduced below 0 in this manner. Any amount of magical healing removes this
      penalty, as does a DC 15 Heal check, which can be made as a standard
      action.</p>

      <p>If the blacksmith chooses to sunder the creature&#8217;s natural
      weapon, on a successful check he deals damage to the creature equal to his
      normal weapon damage and it takes a penalty to attack rolls with that
      natural weapon equal to the number of bonus damage dice granted by his
      thunderous blows class feature for 1 round.</p>
