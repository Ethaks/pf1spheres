      <p><strong>Increased Toughness (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript
      gains 3 hit points. At every following level, he gains an additional hit
      point; these hit points stack with those granted by the Toughness
      feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Increase Defense (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, the amount of
      damage which can be redirected to his delayed damage pool increases to 4 x
      his base attack bonus. If the conscript also has the Greater Delayed
      Damage talent, these bonuses stack.</p>

      <p><strong>Calculated Resistance (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript
      can choose to not empty their pooled damage from the Guardian sphere for
      up to 5 rounds, although if the pooled damage reaches its maximum limit at
      any point, it immediately empties. Any healing the conscript receives also
      removes an equal amount of damage from their pooled damage.</p>
