      <p>The technician gains the Master Craftsman feat and either the Craft
      Wondrous Items or Craft Magical Arms and Armor feat (player&#8217;s
      choice). The technician may use his ranks in any relevant Craft or
      Profession skill as his caster level and when making checks with either
      feat, not just the skill selected with Master Craftsman. This insight may
      be gained twice. If gained a second time, the technician gains the feat
      not chosen the first time. The technician must be at least level 6 to gain
      this insight.</p>
