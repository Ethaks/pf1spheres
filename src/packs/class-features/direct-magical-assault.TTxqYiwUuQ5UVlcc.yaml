    value: >
      <p>The commander may use a standard action to allow any one creature
      currently benefiting from one of his shouts or tactics to cast a spell or
      activate a spell-like or supernatural ability as a free action that can be
      taken even if it&#8217;s not their turn. The granted spell or ability
      cannot have a casting or activation time greater than a standard action.
      If the granted action is not taken immediately following the
      commander&#8217;s use of this ability, this effect is wasted (the
      benefiting target cannot &#8220;store&#8221; the action for use at a later
      time).</p>
