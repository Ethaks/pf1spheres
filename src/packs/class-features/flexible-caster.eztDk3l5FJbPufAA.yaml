      <p>At 15th level, the thaumaturge may use an invocation to gain use of a
      single magic talent of his choice for 1 minute. He must meet the
      prerequisites (if any) and he can gain a base sphere he does not already
      possess with this ability. A thaumaturge may only have one use of flexible
      caster active at any one time; using this invocation again replaces the
      previous use.</p>
