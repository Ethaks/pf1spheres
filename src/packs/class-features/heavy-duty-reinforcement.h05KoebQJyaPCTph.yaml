      <p>The blacksmith adds temporary reinforcements to his and his
      allies&#8217; equipment, increasing the hardness and hit points of all
      affected creatures&#8217; weapons and armor by an amount equal to his
      class level. In addition, weapons affected by this maintenance ignore an
      amount of hardness when used to sunder or damage objects equal to 1/2 the
      blacksmith&#8217;s class level (minimum 1).</p>
