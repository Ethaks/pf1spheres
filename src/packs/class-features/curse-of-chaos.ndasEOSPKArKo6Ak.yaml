      <p>As a swift action, you may spend a spell point to charge your next
      attack with disruptive energies. The next creature you deal damage to with
      a manufactured or natural weapon attack before the start of your next turn
      increases its wild magic chance by 100% for a number of rounds equal to
      your casting ability modifier. Affected creatures are unaware of this
      penalty.</p>
