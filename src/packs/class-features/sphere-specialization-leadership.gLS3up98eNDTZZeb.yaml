      <p><strong>Cohort Coordination:</strong> At 3rd level and every five
      levels thereafter, a conscript gains a teamwork feat he qualifies for as a
      bonus feat. The conscript may share these feats with any cohort within
      close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 class levels), even if they would not
      normally qualify for it.</p>

      <p><strong>Directed Motion:</strong> At 8th level, the conscript may grant
      an additional move action to a number of cohorts equal to his practitioner
      ability modifier (minimum 1) as a move action. This additional move action
      may only be used to move.</p>

      <p><strong>True Leader:</strong> At 20th level, the conscript&#8217;s
      cohorts gain a morale bonus to AC and all saving throws equal to the
      conscript's practitioner ability modifier and fast healing 5.</p>
