      <p>Over the course of his career, the commander makes friends and earns
      favors with all manner of individuals whose careers intersect with the
      military and adventuring lifestyles. Once per week, as long as the
      commander is in a small town or larger center of civilization, the
      commander may call in such a favor to gain temporary access to specially
      trained mounts for himself and his allies. These mounts may be camels,
      hippogriffs, sharks, or any type of animal as appropriate to the local
      environments, but mounts gained through use of this ability never have
      more than 5 HD. The commander gains access to a number of mounts equal to
      his class level; these mounts are typically well-equipped to deal with
      local terrains, whether that entails swimming, flying, or another form of
      movement, and have a 60 ft. movement speed appropriate to any of their
      modes of movement; generally, mounts should not have more than two
      movement modes (such as a land and fly speed), and may only have one if
      appropriate, such as a shark only having a swim speed.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the exact type or nature of these mounts, they know that
      they are on loan and consider their own safety to be of utmost importance;
      if the party is attacked or otherwise comes under fire from an enemy
      source, the mounts will immediately deposit the commander and his allies
      in the nearest safest location before retreating to a safe distance until
      the danger ends. The mounts will also not allow themselves to be sold, and
      generally have prominent markings declaring their ownership, such as
      branding or dyeing in the design or colors of the rightful owner. In
      addition, the mounts will not follow the commander or his allies into
      obviously dangerous situations, including into dungeons, active volcanoes,
      extra-planar rifts, etc. The commander has access to these mounts for 1
      week, plus 1 additional week at 11th level and every 4 levels
      thereafter.</p>
