      <p>The blacksmith gains a familiar, as the wizard&#8217;s arcane bond
      option, using his blacksmith levels as wizard levels for this purpose, as
      well as Object Familiar (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 481) as a bonus
      feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.</p>

      <p>The blacksmith must select a Tiny animated object in place of a normal
      creature whenever he could select a familiar, and the familiar gains a
      toy-like appearance. The blacksmith can choose any special ability a
      normal familiar could grant its master (such as a fox&#8217;s +2 bonus on
      Reflex saves or a cat&#8217;s +3 bonus on Stealth checks) and gains that
      bonus as though his animated object familiar were a familiar of that
      kind.</p>

      <p>The blacksmith may use his reforge ability on his familiar, spending 1
      hour to change its appearance, so long as it retains a toy-like
      appearance. When he does this, the blacksmith may reselect the special
      ability his animated object grants him as a familiar.</p>

      <h2 id="toc43"><span><span style="color: #993300">Artisan
      Savant</span></span></h2>

      <p>Starting at 3rd level, the blacksmith becomes proficient in creating
      powerful magic equipment, treating his class level as his caster level for
      crafting feats and abilities and using the appropriate Craft skill
      (weapons, armor, bows, etc.) for the check to complete the item. In
      addition, the blacksmith gains Craft Wondrous Item as a bonus feat at 3rd
      level, and Craft Magic Arms and Armor at 5th level.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If using Spheres of Power, you may exchange
      these feats for Craft Marvelous Items and Smith Magical Weapons And Armor,
      respectively.</p>

      <h2 id="toc44"><span><span style="color: #993300">Reforge
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>From 3rd level on, the blacksmith&#8217;s experience with crafting
      excellent equipment allows him to manipulate and rework magical equipment
      without damaging or sacrificing its magical potency. The blacksmith can
      spend 1 hour per total effective bonus (minimum 1 hour) of an enchanted
      armor, weapon, or shield (enhancement bonus plus permanent special ability
      bonus equivalents) at an operational forge to reforge the equipment into
      another equivalent item at no additional cost; weapons into weapons of
      another type, armor into a separate type of armor, and shields into
      weapons, armor, or other types of shields; a heavy shield can be converted
      into a light shield or vice versa, and a tower shield can be converted
      into any other type of shield, but bucklers, light shields and heavy
      shields cannot be converted into tower shields. When reforging, the
      blacksmith cannot exchange one piece of equipment for another that is not
      predominantly made out of the same dominant material; a greatclub can be
      reforged into a quarterstaff or spear, but not into a bastard sword, and a
      suit of platemail could be reforged into a breastplate or chain shirt, but
      not into a suit of leather armor. The new weapon or armor must be the same
      size or smaller as the original.</p>

      <p>In addition, the blacksmith can restore a magic weapon, armor, or
      shield that has been destroyed by a sunder attack or similar ability; if
      the blacksmith can acquire all the broken pieces of the equipment, he may
      restore it to its original complete condition, including all enchantments,
      with 8 hours of work at an operational forge.</p>

      <h2 id="toc45"><span><span style="color: #993300">Rapid Maintenance
      (Ex)</span></span></h2>

      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s skill at performing maintenance improves and he
      may now perform multiple maintenances at once. At 9th, 13th, and 17th
      level, the blacksmith may perform 1 additional maintenance during an 8
      hour rest (for a total of 4 maintenances per affected creature at 17th
      level).</p>

      <h2 id="toc46"><span><span style="color: #993300">Smith&#8217;s
      Masterpiece</span></span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level the blacksmith reaches the pinnacle of his craft.
      Throughout his career, the blacksmith has collected and hoarded special
      materials, crafting secrets, and scraps of ancient rituals, all in
      preparation for his ultimate life&#8217;s work. The blacksmith crafts a
      single magic armor, weapon, or shield of his choice, imbuing it with power
      beyond what any normal piece of equipment can contain. The crafted item
      has a +5 enhancement bonus, and the smith may choose up to +8 effective
      enhancement bonus&#8217; worth of special abilities to apply to this piece
      of equipment; once chosen, these enhancements cannot be changed. This
      ability supersedes the normal restriction preventing equipment from
      exceeding a total enhancement bonus of +10 including class abilities. As
      long as the blacksmith and his masterpiece are on the same plane, the
      blacksmith can recall the masterpiece to himself with 1 minute of
      concentration, even if it is currently in another creature&#8217;s
      possession.</p>
