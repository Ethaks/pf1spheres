      <p><strong>Initiation:</strong> The scarlet dancer increases the amount of
      bleed damage she deals when applying bloodletting to her Charisma
      modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Understanding:</strong> When the scarlet dancer causes an enemy
      to become exsanguinated, she may spend 2 points of vitae as a free action
      to make an attack against an enemy within reach that is not
      exsanguinated.</p>

      <p><strong>Revelation:</strong> A crimson dancer who knows their limits
      can maintain a calm, stable attitude even in the face of death, and
      instead embrace a delicate and graceful form of combat. Once per turn,
      when the scarlet dancer causes a nonbleeding creature to begin bleeding
      with a melee weapon due to her bloodletting feature, or would inflict her
      bloodletting on an exsanguinated creature with a melee weapon, she may
      move up to 10 feet as a free action. This movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity from bleeding creatures, and she may move through
      squares occupied by a creature bleeding from her bloodletting feature
      without an Acrobatics check.</p>

      <p><strong>Secret of Blood:</strong> The scarlet dancer flourishes upon
      the velvet floor. Once per round, while adjacent to a bleeding creature,
      the scarlet dancer may spend 1 vitae as a swift action to move into an
      unoccupied square that is adjacent to a creature that is not exsanguinated
      within close range (25 + 5 per 2 crimson dancer levels) and within her
      line of sight. This movement is considered to be a supernatural
      teleportation effect.</p>

      <p>If the scarlet dancer possesses the Blood Fountain (bleed) talent, the
      crimson dancer may use this ability while adjacent to, or standing on, a
      square filled with bloody terrain.</p>

      <p><strong>Secret of Heart:</strong> The scarlet dancer always moves
      gracefully, and never ceases to stop her dance. The scarlet dancer&#8217;s
      base speeds can never be reduced by an effect (including wearing heavy
      armor or encumbrance). She may also spend 4 vitae points as an immediate
      action to ignore any effect or condition that would impede her movement
      for one round, as per the Freedom (word) talent of the Fate sphere. This
      is a supernatural effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Secret of Soul:</strong> The scarlet dancer&#8217;s soul
      becomes truly free, and capable of performing a sacred technique known as
      the sanguine dance. As a full-round action, the scarlet dancer immediately
      drains all of her stored vitae. For each 6 points of vitae drained, she
      can dash forward, moving in a single direction up to 60 feet (this
      movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity), attacking each creature
      she passes through with her decimate special attack action (without
      needing to expend focus). Each dash must be performed sequentially, and a
      creature already struck by an attack cannot be attacked again.</p>

      <p>After performing the sanguine dance, the scarlet dancer cannot perform
      it again for 24 hours and she loses any remaining vitae she may have had.
      The scarlet dancer cannot use other abilities that allow her to move while
      performing the sanguine dance, she must finish all dashes sequentially
      without additional movement, and if she is subject to forced movement, she
      may not utilize any additional dashes she had remaining.</p>

      <p><strong>Realization:</strong> The scarlet dancer becomes unbound. She
      can move into a space occupied by a creature suffering from her
      bloodletting, or any adjacent spaces, without consuming movement,
      requiring an Acrobatics check, or provoking attacks of opportunities as
      part of any action made to move.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the scarlet dancer can treat any creature suffering from
      her bloodletting as if they were exsanguinated, if it would be beneficial
      to her.</p>
