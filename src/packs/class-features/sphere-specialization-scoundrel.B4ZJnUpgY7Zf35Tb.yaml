      <p><strong>Easy Mark (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript deals damage
      equal to 1/2 his level + his practitioner modifier whenever he
      successfully resolves a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver.</p>

      <p><strong>Brutal Trickster (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever the
      conscript successfully uses a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver, the
      creature affected by it must make a successful Fortitude saving throw or
      be staggered for 1 round. At 16th level, the creature also loses their
      martial focus if they possess it.</p>

      <p><strong>Master Thief (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript makes a successful steal or dirty trick attempt against a
      creature, the next time the conscript forces that creature to make a
      saving throw within 1 minute, they must roll twice and take the worse
      result.</p>
