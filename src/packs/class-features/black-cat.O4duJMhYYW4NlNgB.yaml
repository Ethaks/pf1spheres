      <p>Familiars belonging to scholars with this ability always take the form
      of a black cat and cannot be exchanged for other creatures with the
      Improved Familiar feat or large animal training knack unless that creature
      is also feline in appearance in its natural form (such as a cait sith or
      panther); if the scholar had an animal other than a cat as her familiar
      before gaining this imposition her connection with it is broken and the
      black cat drives it away. The scholar can activate this imposition to
      cause her black cat to set off a series of minor events that result in
      remarkably bad luck for anyone affected; all creatures within 20 ft. of
      the black cat other than the scholar take a -2 penalty on attack rolls,
      Dexterity-based skill checks, and Perception checks for a number of rounds
      equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus (minimum 1); this penalty
      increases by an additional -1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.
      The scholar must have the small animal training scholar&#8217;s knack or
      have gained a familiar from another source to select this imposition.</p>
