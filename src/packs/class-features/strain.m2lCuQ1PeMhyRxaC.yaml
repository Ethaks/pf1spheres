    value: >
      <p>At 1st level, as a free action a savant may increase his base attack
      bonus by 2 until the end of his turn. Doing so is extremely taxing,
      leaving him fatigued for 1 round. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level,
      and by an additional +1 for every 4 levels thereafter to a maximum of +6
      at 17th level.</p>

      <p>When activating this ability, if he fails to deal damage or succeed on
      a combat maneuver before the beginning of his next turn, he must make a
      Fortitude save equal to 10 + class level or be dazed instead of fatigued.
      These conditions bypass immunity. If the savant is already fatigued, he is
      instead exhausted and if exhausted, he instead falls unconscious for the
      same duration.</p>
