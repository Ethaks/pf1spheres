      <p><strong>Extended Illusions (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, any illusion
      the incanter creates and maintains through concentration lasts a number of
      additional rounds equal to 1/2 his incanter level after he stops
      maintaining concentration (minimum +1).</p>

      <p><strong>Bedeviling Aura (Su):</strong> At 8th level, as a standard
      action you can emit a 30-foot aura that bedevils your enemies with
      phantasmal assailants. Enemies within this aura move at half speed, are
      unable to take attacks of opportunity, and are considered to be flanked.
      This is a mind-affecting effect. Maintaining this effect is a free action,
      and you can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your
      incanter level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>

      <p><strong>Permanent Illusion:</strong> At 20th level, the incanter can
      make one illusion permanent. He can have no more than one illusion made
      permanent in this way at one time. If he designates another illusion as
      permanent, the previous permanent illusion ends.</p>
