      <p><strong>Mana Master:</strong> The incanter&#8217;s mastery over magic
      is unmatched by any other. At 3rd level, he gains a +2 bonus on all
      Spellcraft and Knowledge (arcana) checks. Additionally, his magic skill
      bonus and defense both increase by +1. These bonuses increase by 1 at 7th
      level and every four levels thereafter.</p>

      <p><strong>Reinforce Magic:</strong> At 8th level when an ally within
      close range of the incanter casts or attempts to dispel a sphere effect,
      as a free action that may be taken outside of his turn he may reinforce
      that magical effect. This grants the ally the benefits of his mana master
      ability, but only for that specific use of the sphere effect. He may use
      this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his casting ability
      modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Impossible Magic:</strong> The incanter&#8217;s magic will
      forever be unimpeded, and his mastery of antimagic provides him with a
      defense against it. At 20th level, when the incanter casts a sphere
      effect, he may spend up to 10 additional spell points when casting it to
      reinforce the sphere effect. The sphere effect is unimpeded by any attempt
      to counterspell it (which fails automatically) and penetrates any
      antimagic effects originating from creatures with a magic skill bonus
      lower than twice the amount of additional spell points used to reinforce
      the sphere effect.</p>
