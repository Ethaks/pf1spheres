      <p>Whenever the sage uses the ability granted by the enhancer esoteric
      training package to grant himself a bonus to one or more of his physical
      ability scores, he gains a +1 competence bonus to his CMB and CMD for the
      duration of the effect. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this
      bonus increases by an additional +1.</p>
