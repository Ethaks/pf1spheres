      <p>A savant may combine combat spheres and talents to create powerful
      martial techniques.</p>

      <p>Savants are considered Proficient combatants. When they gain their
      first level in the savant archetype, savants may choose either Charisma,
      Intelligence or Wisdom as their practitioner modifier. Whenever a savant
      rests for 8 hours (or the equivalent), he may change any and all combat
      talents gained from savant levels, choosing new spheres and new
      talents.</p>

      <p>Combat talents gained as part of levels taken in other classes, as part
      of his martial tradition, or combat talents gained from taking the Extra
      Combat Talent feat are not eligible to be changed in this fashion.</p>
