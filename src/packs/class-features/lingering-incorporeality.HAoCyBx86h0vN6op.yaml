      <p>When the wraith ends his wraith form ability, he may choose to remain
      in wraith form for two additional rounds without spending any rounds from
      his daily allotment. If the wraith was in wraith form when activating his
      possession ability, he automatically regains his wraith form upon ending
      the possession if within this time.</p>
