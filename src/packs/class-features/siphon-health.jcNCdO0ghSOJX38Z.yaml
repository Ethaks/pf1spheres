      <p>The soul weaver may expend a soul to siphon health from a living
      creature. The target suffers 1d6 damage per 2 levels (minimum 1d6,
      Fortitude half), and the soul weaver gains temporary hit points that last
      one hour equal to the damage dealt. A creature cannot be damaged beyond
      what would kill them.</p>
