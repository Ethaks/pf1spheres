      <p>The armorist may cause a piece of summoned or bound equipment to appear
      on or in the possession of a Conjuration sphere companion that she has
      summoned. The companion must be within 25 feet + 5 feet per two armorist
      levels. The companion may be treated as the armorist for the purposes of
      maintaining the bound equipment in its possession.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if she possesses the Variable Armaments feat, she may
      apply the benefits of any equipment tricks granting additional weapon
      special ability options to those available to her companion.</p>
