      <p>The shifter gains low-light vision if she does not already possess it.
      The shifter may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural
      thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed
      and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns,
      briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede
      motion, however, still affect her.</p>
