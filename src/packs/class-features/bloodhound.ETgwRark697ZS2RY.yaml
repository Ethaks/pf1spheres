      <p>The conscript revels in bloodshed. Any effect from him that would
      inflict bleed damage increases that bleed damage by 1, +1 for every 10
      class levels he has. He additionally gains the ability to attempt Heal
      checks to try and end bleeds on creatures as a swift action, and gain a +2
      bonus on any such checks.</p>

      <p>Starting at 5th level, he gains the blood identification class feature
      of the crimson dancer.</p>
