      <p><strong>Resistance (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter gains
      resistance equal to his incanter level to an energy type of his choice,
      chosen when he rests to regain spell points.</p>

      <p><strong>Energy Absorption (Su):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter
      gains an amount of energy absorption equal to 3 times his incanter level
      per day. Whenever he takes energy damage, apply immunity, vulnerability
      (if any), and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption,
      reducing his daily total by that amount. Any damage in excess of his
      absorption is applied to him normally.</p>

      <p><strong>Protected Life (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the first time
      each day that the incanter would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by
      damage, he is instead reduced to 1.</p>
