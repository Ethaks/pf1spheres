      <p><strong>Tech Specialization (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level,
      increase the conscript&#8217;s maximum charge pool size by his
      practitioner ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Masterful Machinery (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the
      conscript increases the number of crafted gadgets he can have prepared at
      any one time by his practitioner ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Master Technician (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the conscript
      may craft a gadget from the Tech sphere to be permanent. While
      unactivated, permanent devices gain charges at the rate of 1 per hour. The
      conscript may only have one permanent device at a time, if the conscript
      has already reached this limit and wishes to create a new permanent
      device, he must select one of his existing permanent devices to
      dismantle.</p>
