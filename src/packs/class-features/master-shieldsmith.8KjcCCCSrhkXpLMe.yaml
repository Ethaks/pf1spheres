      <p>The blacksmith&#8217;s shieldcraft has reached its pinnacle, allowing
      him to craft shields whose intricate details are too refined for anyone
      but him to truly master. The blacksmith does not lose his shield bonus to
      AC when attacking with a weapon wielded with his shield arm, and does not
      take two-weapon fighting penalties for his off-hand attacks when using a
      shield bash as one of his weapons when two-weapon fighting. This also
      negates the penalties from the Dual Wielding sphere.</p>
