    value: >
      <p>Whenever the technician attacks a target who is flat-footed, is denied
      their Dexterity bonus to AC, or that the technician is flanking, the
      technician&#8217;s attacks deal an additional amount of damage equal to
      1/2 the technician&#8217;s class level (minimum: 1). This insight
      qualifies the technician for feats and other options that require sneak
      attack dice, as if each point of precision damage dealt was a sneak attack
      die that always rolls &#8216;1&#8217;. This stacks with any sneak attack
      the technician might possess from another source.</p>
