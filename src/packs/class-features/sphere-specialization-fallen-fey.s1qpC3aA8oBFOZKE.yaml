      <p><strong>Fey Nature (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, while under the effects
      of his fey-link the incanter gains DR/cold iron and an insight bonus to
      attack rolls made with natural weapons granted by the Fallen Fey sphere
      equal to half his class level.</p>

      <p><strong>Resist Fey Lures (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter may
      roll twice and take the better result on saves against mind-affecting
      abilities originating from creatures of the fey type.</p>

      <p><strong>Fey-Touched (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the incanter is
      treated as a fey rather than as a humanoid (or whatever his creature type
      was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. He is always
      considered under the effects of a fey-link, though fey-blessings still
      only last for the usual duration of a fey-link when activated.</p>
