      <p>At 20th level, the troubadour has become a master of all of his roles.
      Whenever he prepares a persona, he can choose to prepare 2 personas at
      once. He may assume either of them or his base persona as a free action
      usable once per round. If he changes a prepared persona through the quick
      change class feature, he may choose either of his prepared personas to
      switch with the new persona.</p>
