      <p>By studying ancient magic and crafting techniques, the armiger learns
      to customize his arsenal in more fantastic and unusual ways. The armiger
      gains the ability to apply modifications to his customized weapons.
      Applying a modification can be done in the same time it takes the armiger
      to customize a weapon, and each customized weapon can only have one
      modification applied to it at any given time. The armiger can apply any
      modification he meets the minimum level for. A modification applied to a
      custom weapon with the double weapon quality applies to both ends. The
      armiger must have the customized weapons class feature to gain this
      prowess.</p>

      <p>The armiger can select from the following initial modifications:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Flexible Materials:</strong> The customized weapon gains the
      trip weapon special feature and grants a +2 circumstance bonus on disarm
      combat maneuvers made using the weapon.</li>

      <li><strong>Grapnel Attachment:</strong> The armiger customizes his weapon
      to fire a built-in grappling hook. The grappling hook is attached to a
      30-foot-long chain. The armiger can attack with the grappling hook as a
      special attack action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. On
      a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but functions as
      though it had the grapple weapon special feature, except it requires only
      a hit (not a critical hit). The grapple ends if the armiger moves more
      than 30 feet away from the grappled creature. The customized weapon cannot
      be used to make attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (as a
      standard action). The length of the chain increases by 5 feet at level 5,
      and every 5 thereafter, and the armiger increases the maximum distance he
      can stand from the grappled target by the same amount.</li>

      <li><strong>Lethality Repurposing:</strong> The customized weapon can be
      used to deal lethal or nonlethal damage without taking a penalty on your
      attack roll.</li>

      <li><strong>Odd Curves and Edges:</strong> Choose bludgeoning, piercing,
      or slashing. The customized weapon deals the chosen damage type in
      addition to any damage types it normally deals.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>At 6th level, the armiger gains access to the following
      modifications:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Aerodynamic:</strong> The customized weapon may be thrown
      easily despite its shape. The customized weapon gains a range increment of
      10 feet and can be thrown up to 5 range increments. If the customized
      weapon already has a range increment, instead increase the weapon&#8217;s
      range increment by 10 feet instead. This modification can only be applied
      to melee weapons.</li>

      <li><strong>Extending Framework:</strong> The customized weapon can extend
      or retract to be wielded at ranges normal weapons couldn&#8217;t. As a
      swift action, the armiger can extend or retract the customized weapon.
      When a customized weapon is extended, it gains the reach quality. When a
      customized weapon is retracted, it loses the reach quality. For example,
      an armiger adds the extending framework modification to a customized
      weapon lance, which allows him to retract his lance and remove the reach
      quality, and can then extend the customized weapon lance to restore the
      reach quality.</li>

      <li><strong>Shielding:</strong> You treat the customized weapon as a
      buckler, gaining a +1 shield bonus to AC as normal for a buckler. You lose
      this bonus (and stop treating the customized weapon as a buckler until the
      start of your next turn) if you attack with the weapon or wield another
      weapon in the same hand, unless you possess an ability to retain your
      shield bonus when making a shield bash attack, such as the Shield sphere
      Bashing Shield talent or the Improved Shield Bash feat. Making an attack
      with this weapon may count as making a shield bash if beneficial. When
      making a shield bash with the customized weapon, reduce the damage as if
      the shield bash was one size smaller.</li>

      <li><strong>Weightless:</strong> The customized weapon is unusually light,
      and can be wielded with greater precision than normal. The weapon is
      treated as a light melee weapon when determining whether it can be used
      with Weapon Finesse, as well as with any feat, spell, or special weapon
      ability that can be used in conjunction with light weapons.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>At 12th level, the armiger gains access to the following
      modifications:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Dense Weighting:</strong> The customized weapon is treated as
      an appropriate weapon for sundering any type of object. Whenever a
      creature is hit by a customized weapon with this modification, they take a
      -2 penalty to their CMD against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat
      maneuvers until the end of its next turn or until after the creature is
      subject to a maneuver (whichever comes first). This penalty does not stack
      with itself.</li>

      <li><strong>Liquimetal Blanch:</strong> The customized weapon&#8217;s
      surface shimmers and shifts, almost like liquid. Each round, the first
      time the customized weapon would deal damage to a creature that has
      material- based damage reduction, the customized weapon bypasses that
      damage-reduction as if made from that material until the beginning of your
      next turn. For example, the armiger strikes a creature with DR/silver with
      his customized weapon longsword with this modification. The weapon
      immediately hardens to be treated as silver until the end of the round. If
      the armiger would make an attack of opportunity against a creature with
      DR/cold iron during that same round, the customized weapon would not
      change to cold iron. This does not affect the weapon&#8217;s normal
      ability to bypass material-based damage reduction. A cold iron longsword
      with this modification will always bypass cold iron.</li>

      <li><strong>Parrying Edge:</strong> The customized weapon is easier for
      the armiger to block attacks with. When you fight defensively or use
      Combat Expertise while wielding the customized weapon, your AC bonus
      increases by 1. In addition, attacks of opportunity made with the
      customized weapon deal an additional amount of damage equal to your
      practitioner modifier (minimum 1). This additional damage is precision
      damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit. An enemy can only take
      precision damage from this modification once each round.</li>
