      <p>The scholar carefully lays out an unbroken circle of salt, creating a
      protective circle around herself and up to 1 adjacent ally per 2 class
      levels (minimum 1) that lasts for a number of rounds equal to the
      scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). If a protected ally moves
      outside of the square they occupied when the circle was created, the
      protective energy is disrupted and the effect immediately ends. While
      within this circle, the scholar and protected allies gain a circumstance
      bonus to saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and
      supernatural effects equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus
      (minimum 1). Whenever the scholar succeeds on a saving throw against such
      an effect while protected by the circle, she immediately regains her
      martial focus if it is currently expended.</p>

      <p>In addition, while within the circle, the scholar and affected allies
      are also protected from bodily contact by summoned creatures and
      incorporeal undead. This causes the natural weapons and touch attacks of
      such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require
      touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded creature
      takes any hostile action against a blocked creature, and that creature may
      pass through the barrier (though other creatures are still warded as
      normal).</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Dispelling Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar adds
      a mixture of silver, salt, lead, and other materials which naturally
      disrupt magical energies to her flashbangs. Creatures that fail their save
      against the flashbang&#8217;s initial effect are also subject to a
      targeted dispel magic spell, using the scholar&#8217;s level as the caster
      level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. If the
      scholar also possesses the silver material imposition, this instead acts
      as a targeted greater dispel magic effect.</li>
