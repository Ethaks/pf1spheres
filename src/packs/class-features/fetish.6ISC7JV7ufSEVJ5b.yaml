      <p>The hedgewitch may bind one masterwork item to herself as a fetish. She
      may enchant this item as if she possessed the prerequisite item creation
      feat, provided she meets that item creation feat&#8217;s other
      prerequisites, such as minimum caster level. She may change her fetish at
      any time by spending 8 hours binding a new one, but doing so causes her
      previous fetish to lose all of its magic, becoming an ordinary masterwork
      item again.</p>
