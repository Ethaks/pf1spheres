      <p>Starting at 3rd level if the conscript can catch a creature when he is
      unable to defend himself effectively from his attack, he can strike a
      vital spot for extra damage.</p>

      <p>The conscript&#8217;s attack deals extra damage anytime his target
      would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a
      Dexterity bonus or not), or when the conscript flanks his target. This
      additional damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and increases by 1d6 every three
      levels thereafter. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the
      target is within 30 feet. This additional damage is precision damage and
      is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>

      <p>With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed
      strike, or whip), a conscript can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal
      damage instead of lethal damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal
      damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual
      &#8211;4 penalty.</p>

      <p>The conscript must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a
      vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A conscript cannot sneak
      attack while striking a creature with total concealment.</p>
