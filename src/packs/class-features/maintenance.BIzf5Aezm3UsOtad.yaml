      <p>Starting at 1st level, the blacksmith learns how to maintain and
      optimize his equipment and that of his party members by sharpening
      weapons, tightening armor straps, replacing padding, and performing other
      tasks that allow him and his companions to get the most out of their gear
      each day. Whenever the party has at least 8 consecutive hours of rest time
      (or the equivalent of 8 hour&#8217;s rest, such as 2 hour&#8217;s rest
      with a ring of sustenance or similar ability), the blacksmith can set
      aside a small period of time to perform these maintenance tasks without
      interfering with his normal rest to give him and a number of allies equal
      to 1 + his Constitution modifier (minimum 1) one of the following benefits
      for 24 hours, or until their next 8 hour or longer rest, whichever comes
      first. The blacksmith may select a different maintenance for each ally to
      be affected.</p>
