    value: >
      <p>At 6th level, a soul weaver may target a creature within close range
      already suffering from a blight and expend a use of channel energy to
      cause that blight to rupture. This deals 1d8 damage (bludgeoning,
      piercing, slashing) per soul weaver level to the target (Fortitude half).
      Using lesion consumes and removes their blight.</p>
