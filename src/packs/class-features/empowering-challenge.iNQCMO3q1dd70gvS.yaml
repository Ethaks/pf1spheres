      <p>At 11th level, whenever a sentinel reduces the target of her challenge
      to 0 or fewer hit points, she gains temporary hit points equal to her
      sentinel level + her Wisdom modifier which last for 1 minute or until
      lost, whichever comes first. If the target of her challenge has fewer Hit
      Dice than half of her class level, this ability does not activate.</p>
