    value: >
      <p>At 11th level, a mageknight gains resistance to magical damage. This
      functions as damage reduction, except it only applies to damage sustained
      from spells, spell-like abilities, and sphere abilities. This only affects
      abilities that allow spell resistance. This damage reduction is equal to
      1/2 the mageknight&#8217;s class level. This does not apply to damage from
      magic weapons.</p>
