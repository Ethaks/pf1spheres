      <p>The sage&#8217;s natural reach with his unarmed strikes and melee touch
      attacks increases by 5 ft., plus an additional 5 ft. for every 4 class
      levels he possesses. Whenever the sage succeeds at a combat maneuver check
      against an opponent, or when the opponent fails a Reflex save against the
      sage&#8217;s infuser ability, the sage may move that opponent up to 10 ft.
      in any direction (including directly up), though the opponent must end
      their movement within the sage&#8217;s unarmed strike reach. Opponents
      moved by this ability provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures other
      than the sage for moving through threatened spaces.</p>
