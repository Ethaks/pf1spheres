      <p>At 1st level, the wraith chooses a haunt path. Once selected, this
      choice cannot be changed. Path skills are always class skills for wraiths
      with that path.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, each path grants the listed path sphere, or a talent from
      that sphere if it is already possessed, as a bonus magic talent and uses
      his class level as his caster level with the path sphere. This stacks
      normally with caster levels gained from other sources.</p>

      <p>At 2nd level, the wraith gains a path possession, granting additional
      options for his possession ability.</p>

      <p>At 4th level, the wraith gains an insight bonus to the listed skill
      equal to half his class level.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the wraith gains an improved path possession, granting
      further options to his possession ability.</p>

      <p>At 14th level, the wraith gains a greater path possession, granting a
      final expansion of options to his possession ability.</p>
