      <p>At 7th level, all uses of the Disable Device skill have their required
      time decreased by 2 steps instead of 1.</p>

      <p>When a technician disarms a trap through the Disable Device skill and
      beats the trap&#8217;s DC by 10 or more, in addition to being able to pass
      by the trap without activating it, he gains one of the following benefits
      as well:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Trap Sphere:</strong> If the technician beats the DC by 10 of
      a trap from the Trap sphere, he may take control of that trap. The
      trap&#8217;s previous owner is no longer able to pass through the
      trap&#8217;s space unharmed, although any creatures who knew where the
      trap was placed still gain the usual bonuses against activating the trap.
      Additionally, the technician may upgrade the trap if it is inferior to his
      own and it is a trap he is able to create, changing its variables such as
      damage, and saving throws, to become as if he had been the one to place
      the trap.</li>

      <li><strong>Magical Trap:</strong> When disarming a magic trap that allows
      specific creatures to pass without danger and beating the trap&#8217;s DC
      by 10 or more, the technician can modify which creatures are allowed to
      pass, such as adding his allies or restricting his enemies if he
      desires.</li>

      </ul>
