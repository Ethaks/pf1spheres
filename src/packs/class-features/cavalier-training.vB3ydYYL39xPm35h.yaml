      <p>At 1st level, the conscript gains the Guardian sphere (challenge)
      package as a bonus talent. If the conscript already has the Guardian
      sphere (challenge) package, he instead gains any talent he qualifies for
      from the Guardian sphere. In addition, the conscript chooses an order, as
      the cavalier class feature of the same name, and must follow the edicts of
      his order. The conscript does not gain his order&#8217;s additional class
      skills or skill bonuses, and does not gain his order&#8217;s challenge
      benefit until he receives the 3rd level benefit from this
      specialization.</p>

      <p>The conscript counts his conscript levels as cavalier levels, and is
      treated as having the cavalier&#8217;s challenge class feature for the
      purpose of qualifying for feats and prerequisites. The conscript treats
      the challenge ability from the Guardian sphere as his cavalier challenge
      class ability for feats and effects. The conscript may challenge a
      creature with more than one source of challenge, such as the cavalier
      challenge class feature, but benefits or penalties from order challenge
      abilities do not stack. If the conscript gains a cavalier order from
      another source, he must choose the same order, and levels of conscript
      stack with other class levels when determining the effects of your
      cavalier order abilities.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the conscript benefits from his order&#8217;s challenge
      ability when using the challenge ability provided by the Guardian sphere
      against the target of his challenge.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, the conscript gains the 2nd level ability of his chosen
      order.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the conscript gains the 8th level ability of his chosen
      order.</p>
