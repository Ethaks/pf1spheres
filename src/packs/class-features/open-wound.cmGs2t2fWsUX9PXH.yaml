      <p>When the armiger uses a customized weapon to damage a creature, all
      attacks made against that creature until the start of her next turn count
      as being of all the special materials of the previous attacks since the
      beginning of her turn. Additionally, if a weapon used possesses a special
      ability (such as the holy weapon ability) or enhancement bonus that allows
      it to bypass the target&#8217;s damage reduction, subsequent attacks also
      count as having that ability or bonus for the purpose of overcoming damage
      reduction.</p>
