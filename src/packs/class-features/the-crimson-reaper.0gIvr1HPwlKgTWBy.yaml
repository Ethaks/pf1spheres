      <p><strong>Initiation:</strong> The crimson reaper increases the damage
      her burst ability deals by 1d8, plus an additional 1d8 at 6th level and
      every 3 levels thereafter.</p>

      <p><strong>Understanding:</strong> When the crimson reaper kills a
      creature with her burst ability, she may immediately spend an immediate
      action and 2 points of vitae to cause the blood to rush towards another
      creature within her line of sight. That creature must succeed at a
      Fortitude save against her burst ability, or suffer the same amount of
      damage the first creature was dealt, as well as inflicting an amount of
      bloodletting bleed equal to the amount of bleed damage the original
      creature was suffering from before their death. This ability counts as if
      using the burst ability on a creature.</p>

      <p><strong>Revelation:</strong> When the crimson reaper successfully uses
      the burst ability on a creature, she may also mark them for one minute as
      an immediate action. Marked creatures are treated as if they were
      suffering from the maximum amount of bloodletting bleed the crimson reaper
      can apply when determining the effects of any crimson dancer class
      feature, and are exsanguinated. This ability allows the crimson reaper to
      use another burst on marked creatures even if they are not actually
      bleeding. The crimson reaper may only have one creature marked at any
      given time, and may not mark another creature if they already have an
      active mark. Marks can only be removed by causing a marked creature to
      fall unconscious or by slaying them.</p>

      <p><strong>Secret of Blood:</strong> Absorbed by their focus, the crimson
      reaper stops at nothing to kill their prey. When the crimson reaper has a
      creature marked, she gains DR 5/- against all attacks made by creatures
      that are not marked. If she takes a move action to move in a way that
      would place her adjacent to a marked creature, she does not need to
      attempt Acrobatics checks to move through the squares of other creatures,
      and may spend 2 points of vitae when moving through another
      creature&#8217;s square to perform an overrun maneuver on them as a free
      action.</p>

      <p><strong>Secret of Heart:</strong> The crimson reaper absorbs those she
      marks for death. When a marked creature with Hit Dice equal to half the
      crimson reaper&#8217;s level or more dies to her burst or decimation
      features, she may steal a part of their body as a free action. For each
      ability score the creature had that was higher than the crimson reaper's,
      she gains a +2 alchemical bonus to that ability score. For each movement
      speed that creature possessed that was higher than the crimson reapers,
      she gains a +10-foot bonus to that movement speed if she also possesses
      it.</p>

      <p>These bonuses cannot increase the crimson reaper&#8217;s speeds or
      ability scores higher than the base creature&#8217;s, and can stack up to
      3 times. At 19th level, these bonuses can stack up to 4 times, to a
      maximum of +8 to each ability score, or +40 feet to each movement speed.
      These bonuses remain for 24 hours.</p>

      <p><strong>Secret of Soul:</strong> The crimson reaper&#8217;s soul is
      unleashed as she pulverizes her foes. When the crimson reaper attempts a
      decimation attack against a marked creature, she does not need to expend
      her martial focus. If a marked creature survives a decimation attack, the
      crimson reaper can expend all of her vitae to attempt a crimson
      decapitation as an immediate action. The creature must succeed at a saving
      throw against the crimson reaper&#8217;s burst ability or otherwise suffer
      damage as normal. For every 6 points of vitae spent as part of the crimson
      decapitation, the creature suffers additional damage as if she failed a
      save against the burst ability. Damage dealt with a crimson decapitation
      is additional damage dealt by the decimation attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Realization:</strong> The crimson reaper&#8217;s fury sparks
      aflame when she kills her quarry. Once per day, when a marked target dies
      due to the crimson reaper&#8217;s decimation attack, she may spend an
      immediate action and 4 points of vitae to immediately cause any number of
      creatures within line of sight to suffer from her burst, and become
      marked. For one minute after using this ability, she has no limit on the
      number of creatures she may have marked at the same time. After this time,
      all creatures she has currently marked lose their marks.</p>
