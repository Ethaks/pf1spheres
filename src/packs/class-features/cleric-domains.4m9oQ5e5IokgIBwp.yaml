      <p>The incanter gains the powers and abilities associated with one cleric
      domain of his choice, using his incanter level as his cleric level. This
      stacks with levels from other classes that grant domains, but only if the
      domains chosen by both classes are the same. This does not grant domain
      spells. He uses his casting ability modifier in place of Wisdom when
      determining the power of his domains, and he may choose subdomains. He may
      take this specialization multiple times. Each time it is taken, he gains
      another domain.</p>
