      <p>The technician gains either the Beastmastery sphere Animal Companion or
      Pet talent as a bonus talent, even if he does not possess the Beastmastery
      base sphere. The technician may use his ranks in Craft (mechanical) or
      Knowledge (engineering) in place of his base attack bonus when determining
      his effective druid level for the Animal Companion talent (not his base
      attack bonus -3) and his arcane caster level for the Pet talent. If the
      technician gains this technical insight a second time, he gains whichever
      talent he did not choose the first time (between Animal Companion and
      Pet).</p>

      <p>The technician can spend 8 hours creating a construct in the likeness
      of an animal companion or familiar, or modify their existing animal
      companion or familiar, to create a construct companion or familiar (hereby
      referred to as &#8220;construct pet&#8221;). A construct pet uses the
      appropriate animal companion or familiar&#8217;s base statistics and is
      otherwise treated as a normal animal companion or familiar, with the
      following exceptions:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Type:</strong> A construct pet&#8217;s type changes to
      construct and gains all the immunities and properties of the construct
      type (except immunity to mind-affecting effects).</li>

      <li><strong>Properties:</strong> The construct pet retains its
      Intelligence score (and skill points) and its base attack bonus and saving
      throws are unchanged, possessing a lower base attack bonus but higher
      saving throws than a normal construct of its Hit Dice. A construct pet has
      no Constitution score. Construct animal companions gain bonus hit points
      appropriate for a construct of its size. Construct familiars determine
      their statistics normally for a familiar, using their master&#8217;s
      statistics where appropriate after applying these changes. A construct pet
      cannot be awakened and cannot be modified as a normal construct can.</li>

      <li><strong>Technician Synergy:</strong> The technician can repair their
      construct pet as though it were an independent invention and does not need
      to spend money on raw materials to do so. Additionally, a construct pet is
      automatically trained and aware of how to use and activate the
      technician&#8217;s inventions as though it were the technician, and does
      not suffer penalties for using one.</li>

      <li><strong>Still An Animal:</strong> The technician&#8217;s construct pet
      is treated as an animal ally for the Beastmastery sphere, despite it being
      a construct, and the technician can use the Handle Animal skill on their
      construct pet normally for all purposes. When handling his construct pet,
      the technician may use his bonus in Craft (mechanical) or Knowledge
      (engineering) instead of his bonus in Handle Animal.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If the technician&#8217;s animal companion or familiar would die, or
      their construct pet is destroyed, instead of finding a new animal
      companion or familiar, the technician can spend 8 hours either modifying
      the animal companion or familiar to become a construct pet or repairing
      their construct pet, returning it back to life.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If the technician gains the ability to add a
      subtype to an independent invention, he may give his construct pet one
      subtype (a construct pet cannot possess more than one subtype this way).
      The technician can add or change a subtype granted this way whenever he
      spends 8 hours repairing or building a construct pet.</p>
