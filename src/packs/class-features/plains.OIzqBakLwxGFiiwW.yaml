      <p>Whether through cultured farmlands or rolling fields of untamed grass,
      the commander knows how to fight and travel through all kinds of plains.
      When fighting or traveling through plains terrain, the commander and any
      ally affected by one of his tactics or shouts ignore non-magical difficult
      terrain, double the effective distance at which a Perception check for
      detecting the presence of others can succeed, can exit a trench without
      paying an additional square of movement, and gain a competence bonus on
      Survival checks to scavenge food equal to the higher of the
      commander&#8217;s Charisma or Intelligence modifiers (minimum 1).</p>
