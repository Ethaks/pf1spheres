      <p>The technician may create a gadget that explodes in 1 round, at the end
      of his turn. As part of the standard action used to create this detonator,
      he may throw the detonator (with a range increment of 10 ft.), place it,
      or hide it in a space within his natural reach. After one round (at the
      end of his turn), the detonator explodes, dealing 1d6 damage per
      technician level to everything within 5 ft. of the square in which the
      detonator sits, half fire damage and half bludgeoning/piercing/slashing
      damage. Targets within this area may make a Reflex save for half
      damage.</p>

      <p>A detonator counts as a trap from the Trap sphere for the purpose of
      determining its hardness, armor class, hit points, Disable Device DC, and
      its Perception DC if hidden, as well as for things such as the Opportunist
      or Trapper&#8217;s Recovery talents. A detonator cannot be placed in the
      same space as a trap, or another detonator.</p>

      <p>If a detonator is destroyed (including by another detonator), it does
      not explode. If two detonators explode at the exact same time, creatures
      in the overlapped area suffer diminished results from every detonator but
      1, suffering instead 1d6, +1d6 per 5 technician levels for each
      overlapping detonator after the first.</p>
