      <p>The technician gains many new options for inventions, as detailed under
      that section.</p>

      <p>He may give his independent inventions the robot subtype by adding the
      following properties (a construct or independent invention cannot possess
      more than one subtype):</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Intelligent:</strong> Robots are intelligent, and thus have
      skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice. Unless otherwise
      indicated for a specific robot, all robots have Intelligence scores of 10.
      The following are class skills for robots: Climb, Disable Device, Fly,
      Knowledge (all), Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. independent
      inventions can be made Intelligent. Note: When piloting an independent
      invention with its own feats, the pilot may choose on any given round to
      use his own feats or the construct&#8217;s, but not both.</li>

      <li><strong>Vulnerable to Critical Hits:</strong> Whenever a robot takes
      extra damage from a critical hit, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to
      avoid being stunned for 1 round. If it makes the saving throw, it is
      instead staggered for 1 round.</li>

      <li><strong>Vulnerable to Electricity:</strong> Robots take 150% as much
      damage as normal from electricity attacks, unless they are immune to
      electricity via other special defenses.</li>

      <li><strong>Difficult to Create:</strong> Increase the time and gp cost
      required to create a robot by 50% over normal for a construct.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In addition, he may create the following gadgets:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Shocker:</strong> The technician may attach a gadget to a
      target that fills them with low-grade electric shocks, debilitating them.
      Make a melee touch attack against a target. The technician may also throw
      the gadget as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 ft. If
      successful, the target suffers 1d8 nonlethal damage per round for a number
      of rounds equal to the technician&#8217;s level. Each round the target
      suffers this damage, their muscles seize up causing them to be sickened
      and staggered. Either the affected target or another creature may remove
      this gadget as a standard action. The gadget cannot be used again after
      being removed.</li>

      <li><strong>Taser:</strong> The technician may create a gadget that sends
      electric shocks through a target to incapacitate them. Make a melee touch
      attack against a target. That target suffers 1d8 electricity damage for
      every level the technician possesses, half of which is nonlethal damage.
      The target must pass a Fortitude save or be sickened and staggered for 1
      round. The technician may choose to make the taser weaker than his maximum
      damage if he so chooses.</li>

      </ul>
