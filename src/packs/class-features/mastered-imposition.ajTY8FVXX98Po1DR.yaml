      <p>At 20th level, the scholar chooses any one material imposition she
      knows; the scholar no longer needs to expend her martial focus for uses of
      this imposition, never provokes an attack of opportunity for activating
      it, and may activate it as a swift action. If the scholar chooses a
      material imposition that grants an explosive option, any bonus damage it
      deals and the save DC for flashbangs modified by it are determined as
      though the scholar&#8217;s class level were 4 levels higher than it
      actually is.</p>
