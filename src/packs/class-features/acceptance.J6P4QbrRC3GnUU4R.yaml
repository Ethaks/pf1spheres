      <p>A warden of acceptance is aware of the inevitability of death, and
      despite coming to terms with it, still defends his allies to ensure that
      they come to death naturally. These wardens are the bane of undead, and
      commonly protect their allies from the brink of death.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Death</p>

      <p><strong>Accepting Guard:</strong> An accepting warden&#8217;s guard
      feels serene and calming. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guard
      immediately stabilizes his guarded allies when they would fall
      unconscious. If the warden would fall unconscious at the same time as the
      guarded ally (such as both being damaged by an area of effect), the ally
      is stabilized first, then loses the guard's benefits. Additionally, the
      warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a bonus to their Constitution score
      when determining when hit point damage would kill them equal to twice the
      warden&#8217;s guard bonus.</p>

      <p><strong>Grave Sight:</strong> At 7th level, the warden can, as a
      standard action, grant himself the benefits of either the Divine Life or
      Divine Undead alternate divination, instead having a range of close, and
      lasting 1 round per class level.</p>

      <p><strong>Tranquil Patrol:</strong> At 11th level, the warden may spend a
      spell point when using his patrol ability to instill the area around him
      with calming energy. Enemies attempting to enter or move within the
      warden&#8217;s area of patrol must succeed on a Will saving throw or be
      unable to move closer to the warden. Affected creatures may still move
      sideways or backwards. Undead creatures affected by this ability must roll
      their saving throw twice and take the lowest result. Creatures who succeed
      on their saving throw but remain within the area must attempt a new saving
      throw every round they remain within the area. This ability lasts for a
      number of rounds equal to 1/2 the warden&#8217;s class level.</p>

      <p><strong>Soul Ward:</strong> At 15th level, the warden&#8217;s guarded
      allies are instilled with a sense of calm and acceptance, and may roll
      saving throws against negative levels, Death sphere abilities, and death
      effects twice, taking the most favorable result.</p>

      <p><strong>Spirit&#8217;s Ascension:</strong> At 19th level, the warden
      may spend 2 spell points as a standard action to grant a guarded ally the
      ability to flicker between life and death. For the next minute, the ally
      may spend a move action at any time to become incorporeal. While
      incorporeal, the guarded ally may move in any direction and pass through
      solid objects, in addition to the other benefits to being incorporeal.
      After this minute has passed, the ally becomes corporeal.</p>

      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc42"><span>Channel Energy (requires acceptance)</span></h4>

      <p>The warden gains the ability to channel positive energy, as the cleric
      class feature. The warden uses his class level -2 (minimum 1) as his
      cleric level, and may channel positive energy a number of times per day
      equal to 1 + his casting ability modifier (minimum 1).</p>
