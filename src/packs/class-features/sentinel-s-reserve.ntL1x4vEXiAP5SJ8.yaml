    value: >
      <p>Each day, a sentinel gains a number of reserve points equal to 1/2 her
      sentinel level + her Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). She can spend a reserve
      point as a swift action to gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to
      two times her base attack bonus + her Wisdom modifier; these temporary hit
      points last for 1 minute or until lost, whichever comes first. She regains
      reserve points after resting for 8 hours, although she may only regain
      reserve points once every 24 hours.</p>
