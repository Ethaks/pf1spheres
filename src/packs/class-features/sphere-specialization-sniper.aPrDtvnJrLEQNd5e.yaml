      <p><strong>Precision Shots (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the conscript may
      use a move action to aim his weapon, gaining a competence bonus on damage
      rolls with his next ranged attack equal to 1/2 his base attack bonus
      (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Uncanny Accuracy (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a
      conscript makes a successful attack while using the deadly shot ability,
      he treats any weapon damage dice roll of 1 or 2 as 3.</p>

      <p><strong>Perfect Aim (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a conscript
      makes a successful attack while using the deadly shot ability, all weapon
      damage dice added by this ability are maximized.</p>
