      <p>The best troubadours know a hundred tales, and always keeps their ears
      to the ground looking for more. The troubadour gains a +1 bonus to all
      Knowledge checks, +1 per 5 troubadour levels he possesses, and may make
      Knowledge checks untrained.</p>

      <p>This actor training may be taken twice. If taken a second time, the
      bonus increases, becoming equal to 1/2 the troubadour&#8217;s class level
      (minimum 1).</p>
