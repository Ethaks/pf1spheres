      <p>Every sage develops a unique combination of martial and mystical
      talents that form a unique and recognizable style. At 1st level and every
      2 levels thereafter, the sage gains a bonus combat talent or magic talent
      of his choice. Style talents are separate from, and in addition to, the
      Sage's normal combat talents. Sages who gain magic talents are treated as
      High-Casters when determining their caster level, use Wisdom as their
      casting ability modifier, and treat their ki pool as their spell pool when
      using magic spheres and talents.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Some casting traditions that are fine
      for regular caster are <em>crippling</em> for the Sage. Think very
      carefully when deciding which drawbacks, if any, to take. Magical Signs
      isn't too bad, but Diagram Magic and Extended Magic, for example, are
      particularly harsh for the Sage since the limits also apply to your ki
      powers.</sup></p>
