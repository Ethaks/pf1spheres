      <p>Once per day, the commander can use the gather information function of
      the Diplomacy skill over an hour&#8217;s time to discern the locations and
      pass phrases (if any) of secret portals, tunnels, tears between planar
      locations, and similar effects in urban areas, or in ruins and cemeteries
      near urban areas; the commander cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. These
      passages are not necessarily permanent fixtures; they may be planar or
      astral convergences that only happen during particular times of the year,
      abnormal rifts created by recent events in the area, or any number of
      other possible occurrences. While passages uncovered using this ability
      are always reliable to the degree determined by the commander&#8217;s
      gather information check, there are no assurances that the events that
      created the passage will be still viable for longer than 48 hours past the
      travel time to reach them. The function and reliability of this ability is
      determined by his gather information check, as detailed on Table: Secret
      Ways.</p>
