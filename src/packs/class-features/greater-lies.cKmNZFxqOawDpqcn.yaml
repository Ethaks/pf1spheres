    value: >
      <p>When the troubadour attempts to lie through truth-detecting magic,
      zones of truth, or other, similar effects, the caster of those effects no
      longer gains a caster level check (MSB check) to attempt to force the
      troubadour to tell the truth. When he uses the Bluff skill to pass a
      secret message, the words and meaning of his secret messages cannot be
      gleaned from him or those he directly delivers the message to by
      divinations unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (MSB check)
      against a DC of 15 + the troubadour&#8217;s level. The troubadour must be
      4th level and possess the flexible truth class feature to gain this actor
      training.</p>
