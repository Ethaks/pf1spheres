      <p>The symbiat may link the minds of himself and any number of willing
      targets with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher. All targets to be
      connected must be within 60 feet of the symbiat when the effect is begun,
      but they need not remain within 60 feet while it is maintained. All
      affected creatures may communicate with each other through this mental
      link, provided they share a language. Where there is no shared language,
      only simple communication (go, come, attack, help) may be sent.</p>
