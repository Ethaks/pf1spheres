      <p>At 20th level the blacksmith reaches the pinnacle of his craft.
      Throughout his career, the blacksmith has collected and hoarded special
      materials, crafting secrets, and scraps of ancient rituals, all in
      preparation for his ultimate life&#8217;s work. The blacksmith crafts a
      single magic armor, weapon, or shield of his choice, imbuing it with power
      beyond what any normal piece of equipment can contain. The crafted item
      has a +5 enhancement bonus, and the smith may choose up to +8 effective
      enhancement bonus&#8217; worth of special abilities to apply to this piece
      of equipment; once chosen, these enhancements cannot be changed. This
      ability supersedes the normal restriction preventing equipment from
      exceeding a total enhancement bonus of +10 including class abilities. As
      long as the blacksmith and his masterpiece are on the same plane, the
      blacksmith can recall the masterpiece to himself with 1 minute of
      concentration, even if it is currently in another creature&#8217;s
      possession.</p>
