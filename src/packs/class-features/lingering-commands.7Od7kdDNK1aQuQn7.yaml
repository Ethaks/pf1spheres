      <p>The commander is an expert at commanding troops, even under the most
      difficult of conditions. Whenever the benefits of a shout or tactic the
      commander initiated would end, their benefits persist for a number of
      rounds equal to the higher of his Intelligence or Charisma modifiers.
      Instantaneous effects are not affected by this ability, nor are tactics
      that end because the commander used a swift action to activate a different
      tactic.</p>
