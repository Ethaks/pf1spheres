    value: >
      <p>As a swift action, the sage may grant himself a +2 bonus to either his
      Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom score for a number of rounds equal to
      his Wisdom modifier, or for 1 minute if the sage spends a ki point when
      activating the ability. At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, the
      bonus granted by this ability increases by an additional +2. The sage may
      apply all of this bonus to a single mental ability score, or divide it in
      units of +2 between multiple mental ability scores; regardless of how the
      sage assigns this bonus, he cannot add more than +10 to a given ability
      score.</p>
