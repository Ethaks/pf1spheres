      <p>The blacksmith learns how to position the straps and clasps on a shield
      in such a way that he can wield it without hampering the use of an arm;
      the blacksmith may wear a light or heavy shield as a buckler, and does not
      suffer a penalty to attack rolls when using his shield arm to wield a
      weapon or when using a tower shield.</p>
