      <p><strong>Expert Climber (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, the
      conscript gains a climb speed of 20 ft. If he has or gains a climb speed
      from another source, he instead increases his climb speed by 10 ft.
      (unless that would make his total climb speed less than 20 ft.). Whenever
      he climbs and uses another movement mode in the same round, treat his
      speed for both movement modes as being equal to his greatest movement
      speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Uncanny Swimmer (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the conscript
      gains a swim speed of 30 ft. If he has or gains a swim speed from another
      source, increase that swim speed by 10 ft. instead (unless that would make
      his total swim speed less than 30 ft.). Whenever the conscript swims and
      uses another movement mode in the same round, treat his speed for both
      movement modes as being equal to his greatest movement speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Athletic Paragon (Ex):</strong> Upon reaching 20th level, the
      conscript has achieved the peak of physical fitness. Increase the total
      speed of any movement mode he possesses by 10 ft. (this is applied after
      any modifications or bonuses gained from the expert climber or uncanny
      swimmer class features). In addition, he gains a competence bonus to
      Fortitude and Reflex saving throws equal to his practitioner modifier, and
      he does not suffer any penalties to his physical ability scores (Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution) due to aging. Any penalties that have accrued
      due to age prior to this point are removed.</p>
