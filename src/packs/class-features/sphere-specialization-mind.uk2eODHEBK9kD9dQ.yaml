      <p><strong>Enchanting Smile (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter
      gains Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate as class skills and gains a +2
      insight bonus to checks with those skills. This bonus increases by +1 for
      every five incanter levels he possesses, up to a maximum of +6 at 20th
      level.</p>

      <p><strong>Aura of Despair (Su):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter can
      spend a free action to emit a 30-foot aura of despair for one round, for a
      maximum number of rounds per day equal to his incanter level. Enemies
      within this aura take a &#8211;2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls,
      damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. These rounds do not need to
      be consecutive. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Reflective Mind:</strong> At 20th level, whenever the incanter
      succeeds at a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, a spell of the
      enchantment school, or an effect from the Mind sphere, that spell or
      effect does not affect him and is instead reflected back at its caster,
      treating the incanter as if they had cast the spell (such as for the
      purpose of charm or domination effects).</p>
