      <p>This following ability replaces resistance, energy absorption, and
      protected life.</p>

      <p><strong>Lattice (Su):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, the lattice
      weaver gains the ability to call forth a floating mass of crystals made of
      solid force which they can control using their Protection sphere
      abilities.</p>

      <p>Whenever they use their lattice, the effect remains for a number of
      minutes equal to their incanter level, or until they use their lattice for
      a different purpose. The lattice can not be broken or permanently
      destroyed, but things made from the lattice can be.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the incanter can use his lattice to form his barrier
      ward. The lattice barrier can be destroyed or broken as normal (even
      though the lattice can not), and as a standard action, the incanter can
      dismiss the lattice barrier and create a new lattice barrier at a
      different location, or repair an existing lattice barrier. The incanter
      does not need to spend a spell point to make the barrier last without
      concentration, it remains until the normal duration of the lattice expires
      or until the lattice is used for another function.</p>

      <p>The incanter can also use a move action to move their lattice barrier
      up to 20 feet, possibly pushing objects and creatures in the process. The
      barrier has the ability to bullrush targets using a CMB equal to 10 + the
      incanter&#8217;s class level + his casting ability modifier and an
      effective Strength score equal to his casting ability score, but does not
      harm those pushed. Alternatively, the lattice barrier can simply work
      around objects and creatures as it moves.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, the incanter may use his lattice as an immediate action
      to form any aegis he can create around an ally within 60 feet. In addition
      to the normal effects of the aegis, the aegis has a 50% chance to turn any
      critical hit into a normal hit. The character who bears this aegis also
      receives a bonus to the damage of their natural attacks equal to half the
      incanter&#8217;s level, as the sharp edges of the lattice can draw blood
      easily. The incanter can not sacrifice the lattice with a (succor) talent.
      The spell point cost to create the aegis must still be paid, and its
      duration is limited to the duration of the lattice, and it ends if the
      lattice is used for another purpose.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, the incanter may use the lattice to strike an enemy
      within 60 feet with a ranged touch attack as a standard action,
      imprisoning them with crystalline blades of force. The attack does 1d6
      force damage for every 2 levels the incanter has, and the target must
      succeed at a Reflex save versus a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the level of the
      incanter + his casting ability modifier or be entangled by the lattice and
      unable to leave the square they are currently in. This prison is fully
      effective against incorporeal creatures, but disappears if the lattice is
      used for anything else and does not prevent teleportation. The creature
      may attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns.</p>

      <p>At 15th level, the incanter may seed a ward with lattice blades,
      causing all squares within to become difficult terrain for enemies without
      hindering allies. The lattice floats in the air, affecting flying enemies
      as well as those on the ground, and even affecting those underwater or
      underground. The seeding also provides partial cover to allies within the
      ward. Using this ability is a standard action.</p>

      <p>At 20th level, the incanter may spend a standard action to wrap himself
      in a mobile sphere of lattice crystals. While encased, he gains improved
      cover against all attacks, has a fly speed of 60 feet with perfect
      maneuverability, and ignores difficult terrain. Whenever he moves, he can
      move through enemy squares, and when he does so the enemy must succeed at
      a Reflex save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 his incanter level + his casting
      ability modifier or take 1d6 force damage for every level the incanter has
      gained. A successful save halves this damage. He may carry others with him
      inside the sphere, if he can physically pick them up but they are
      effectively unable to act while within.</p>
