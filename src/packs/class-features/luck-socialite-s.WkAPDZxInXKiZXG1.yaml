      <p>People are like machines, and can be manipulated just as easily. The
      technician&#8217;s luck pool increases by 1, and he gains the following
      abilities:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Charming Smile (Ex):</strong> Whenever he makes a Diplomacy
      check or Intimidate check, the technician may spend 1 point of luck to
      roll twice and take the better result.</li>

      <li><strong>Misplaced Trust (Ex):</strong> When attacking a flat-footed
      target whose attitude towards him is Friendly or higher, the technician
      may spend a point of luck. If his attack is successful, it deals double
      damage. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit, and precision
      damage is not doubled by this ability.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A technician must possess the luck technical insight to gain this
      insight.</p>
