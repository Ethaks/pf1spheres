    value: >
      <p>Whenever the blacksmith destroys or inflicts the broken condition on a
      weapon, item, or other piece of equipment with a sunder attempt, he gains
      a +2 morale bonus to attack rolls, and to combat maneuver checks made to
      perform a sunder, until the end of his next turn and may regain his
      martial focus as an immediate action. For every 6 class levels the
      blacksmith possesses, this morale bonus increases by an additional +1.</p>
