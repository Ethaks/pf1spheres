      <p>At 7th level, when targeted by a sphere effect, spell, or spell-like
      ability, as an immediate action the prodigy may expend martial focus to
      make a magic skill check against the caster&#8217;s MSD. If successful,
      the spell is reflected back on the caster. The prodigy is unaffected and
      the caster is treated as if it was the original target. Regardless of
      success, the prodigy is staggered on her next turn.</p>
