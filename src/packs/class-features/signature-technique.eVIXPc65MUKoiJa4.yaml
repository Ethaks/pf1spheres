      <p>At 20th level the sage gains a powerful esotery from the following list
      that acts as his signature technique. The sage cannot select a signature
      technique unless he possesses the corresponding esoteric training package.
      Signature techniques follow all other rules for esoteries, including
      determining saving throw DCs and the number of ki points that can be spent
      when activating them.</p>

      <h4 id="toc79"><span>Desiccate Essence (Manipulator) [AoP2]</span></h4>

      <p>The sage may make a single melee touch attack using his chi gong
      ability as a full-round action; if successful, the target of this attack
      must succeed at a Will saving throw or lose all ki points, martial focus,
      and spell points that they possess, in addition to suffering 2 permanent
      negative levels. A target that succeeds at their saving throw instead
      suffers 1 temporary negative level for 24 hours.</p>

      <h4 id="toc80"><span>Devastation Wave (Ki Blaster)</span></h4>

      <p>The sage&#8217;s ki blast now uses d10s instead of d6s for its damage
      dice. In addition, the sage may use a full round action to fire a powered
      up version of his ki blast. Instead of a ranged touch attack, the
      sage&#8217;s ki blast fires in a 10 ft. radius, 60 ft. long horizontal
      column originating from his square. Any creature within the area of this
      column takes damage as though hit by the sage&#8217;s ki blast (Reflex
      save for half).</p>

      <h4 id="toc81"><span>Heart Stopper (Chakra Disruptor)</span></h4>

      <p>The sage may make a single melee touch attack using his chi gong
      ability as a full round action; if successful, the target of this attack
      must make a Fortitude save or die. Even creatures that are not technically
      living, such as constructs and undead, can be affected by this technique
      as the sage&#8217;s ki tears through their bodies and disrupts the
      energies that animate them.</p>

      <h4 id="toc82"><span>Physical Perfection (Enhancer)</span></h4>

      <p>The sage gains a +5 inherent bonus to each of his physical ability
      scores (Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength), gains DR 5/-, and
      increases his ki pool by 5 points. In addition, the sage no longer takes
      penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged.
      Any such penalties that he has already taken are removed. Age bonuses
      still accrue, and the sage still dies of old age when his time is up, but
      he doubles the maximum age limit for his species.</p>

      <h4 id="toc83"><span>Spider&#8217;s Web (Infuser)</span></h4>

      <p>As a full round action, the sage forms his ki into a wide web that can
      be hurled across the battlefield, covering everything within a 60 ft.
      radius sphere centered on the sage. This web lasts for a number of rounds
      equal to the sage&#8217;s Wisdom modifier. As long as this ability is
      active, the sage threatens every square within its radius and may make an
      unarmed strike, chi gong melee touch attack, or ki blast against any
      creature that provokes an attack of opportunity within this territory
      without moving from his current location, sending pulses of devastating ki
      arcing across the strands of this ki web.</p>
