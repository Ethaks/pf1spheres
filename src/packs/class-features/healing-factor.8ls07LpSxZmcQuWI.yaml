    value: >
      <p>Whenever the sage uses the ability granted by the enhancer esoteric
      training package to grant himself a bonus to one or more of his physical
      ability scores, he may spend a ki point to gain regeneration 1 for the
      duration of the effect. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this
      regeneration increases by an additional 1. Taking damage from ki effects
      (such as a ki blast, chi gong touch attack, or any damaging effect that
      requires the user to expend 1 or more ki points to activate) suppresses
      this regeneration for 1 round.</p>
