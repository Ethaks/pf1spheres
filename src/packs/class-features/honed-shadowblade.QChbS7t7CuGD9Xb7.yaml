      <p>Objects created with the mageknight&#8217;s Shadowstuff Armament feat
      act as if she had the Surreinforcement feat. Treat her mageknight level as
      Illusion caster level for calculating its effects for her shadowstuff
      armaments. This stacks normally with caster levels gained from other
      sources. Once per round as a free action she may cause a creature damaged
      by one of her weapons created or enhanced by her shadowblade mystic combat
      to suffer a -1 circumstance penalty to all Perception checks and Will
      saves against illusions for one minute. This penalty stacks with itself up
      to 5 times.</p>
