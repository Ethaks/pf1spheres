      <p>A sequence may be ended to activate a finisher. Each finisher has a
      required activation action and some have a minimum sequence length. Once a
      finisher has been used, the prodigy&#8217;s sequence is ended. Actions
      taken as part of a finisher do not count toward the current sequence nor
      begin a new sequence.</p>

      <p>The following are your basic finishers:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Adroit Momentum:</strong> A prodigy may end her sequence as
      part of making a skill check to gain a competence bonus equal to the
      number of links in the sequence on that skill check.</li>

      <li><strong>Arcane Apocalypse:</strong> As a 5 link finisher, the prodigy
      may cast a sphere effect as a move action. As a 7 link finisher, the
      prodigy may cast a sphere effect as a swift action. As a 9 link finisher,
      the prodigy may cast up to three sphere effects, one as a standard, one as
      a move, and one as a swift action. Each sphere effect cast in this way
      must have a normal casting time of no more than 1 standard action.</li>

      <li><strong>Certain Strike:</strong> As a 3 link finisher, the prodigy may
      spend a swift action to resolve her next attack roll before the start of
      her next turn as a touch attack.</li>

      <li><strong>Doombringer:</strong> As a 3 link finisher, the prodigy may
      make a single attack as a swift action. If the sequence is at least 5
      links, the prodigy may make an attack action in place of a move action. If
      the sequence is at least 7 links, this attack action may instead be done
      as a swift action. As a 9 link finisher, the prodigy may make up to three
      attack actions, one as a standard, one as a move, and one as a swift
      action. Each attack action must have an activation time of no more than a
      standard action.</li>

      <li><strong>Executioner:</strong> As a 5 link finisher, the prodigy may
      spend a move action to automatically threaten a critical on the next
      attack roll before the end of her turn. If this attack misses, the ability
      is wasted. If the sequence is at least 7 links, this may instead be done
      as a swift action. This effect may not be combined with any ability or
      effect that automatically confirms critical threats.</li>

      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> As a 3 link finisher, the prodigy may regain
      martial focus as a free action.</li>

      <li><strong>Ironhide:</strong> The prodigy may end her sequence as a
      immediate action to gain temporary hit points equal to her level that last
      for a number of rounds equal to the number of links in her sequence. This
      finisher may be used after the result of an attack is revealed and may
      keep the prodigy from dying.</li>

      <li><strong>Penetrating Magic:</strong> The prodigy may end her sequence
      as part of casting a sphere effect to gain a bonus equal to the length of
      her sequence on any MSB checks made to overcome spell resistance made as
      part of that effect.</li>

      <li><strong>Prodigy&#8217;s Reflexes:</strong> As a 3 link finisher, when
      targeted by an attack or forced to make a Reflex save, the prodigy may
      spend an immediate action to make an Acrobatics check and use the result
      in place of her AC or Reflex save. She must use the skill check result
      even if it is lower than her AC. If the sequence is at least 5 links, she
      may instead activate this ability as a free action usable even when it is
      not her turn.</li>

      <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> If the prodigy has a sequence of at least
      5 links, when failing a saving throw, she may end the sequence as an
      immediate action to reroll the save. For every link beyond 5, you gain a
      +1 competence bonus on the reroll.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Some abilities, such as possessing certain spheres, may grant
      additional finisher options. Such options have the (finish) tag.</p>
