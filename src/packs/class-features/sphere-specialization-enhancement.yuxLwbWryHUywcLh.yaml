      <p><strong>Physical Enhancement:</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter gains
      a +1 bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or
      Constitution). This bonus increases by +1 for every five incanter levels
      he possesses. He can change this bonus to a new ability score when he
      rests to regain spell points.</p>

      <p><strong>Perfection Of Self (Su):</strong> At 8th level, as a free
      action the incanter can grant himself an enhancement bonus to a single
      ability score equal to 1/2 his incanter level for one round. He may use
      this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his incanter
      level.</p>

      <p><strong>Permanent Enhancement (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the
      incanter can make one enhancement permanent. He can have no more than one
      enhancement made permanent in this way at one time. If he designates
      another enhancement as permanent, the previous permanent enhancement
      ends.</p>
