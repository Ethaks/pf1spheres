    value: >
      <p>At 12th level and higher, a striker can no longer be flanked. This
      defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the striker by flanking
      her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the
      target has striker levels.</p>

      <p>If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from another
      class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to
      determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
