      <p>The shifter gains a favored enemy, as the ranger class feature. She may
      select this trait once at 2nd level, plus an additional time for every 4
      shifter levels she possesses beyond 2nd. Each time this is gained after
      the first, she gains an additional favored enemy, and the bonuses granted
      against one of her favored enemies (even the one just selected if she
      desires) increase by 2.</p>
