      <p>Whenever the sage deals damage to an opponent using his chi gong
      ability, he may spend a ki point to use his ki to disrupt the
      opponent&#8217;s motor functions. The opponent must succeed at a Fortitude
      save or have all of their movement speeds reduced by 5 ft. per chi gong
      die he possesses until the end of the sage&#8217;s next turn; multiple
      uses of this ability do not stack, and this ability cannot reduce the
      opponent&#8217;s speed to lower than 5 ft. in any movement mode they
      possess.</p>
