      <p>The sage may form his ki blasts into deadly discs of razor sharp energy
      capable of severing an opponent&#8217;s head from their body. Whenever the
      sage makes a ki blast attack, he may spend a ki point to declare it to be
      a ki disc attack, causing it to deal slashing damage instead of the normal
      bludgeoning and piercing damage and making the attack&#8217;s critical
      threat range 18-20 with a x3 critical multiplier (instead of the normal 20
      x2). Whenever the sage rolls a natural 20 on an attack while using this
      ability (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit), the
      ki disc severs the opponent&#8217;s head (if it has one) from its body.
      Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, have no heads.
      Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, are not
      affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die
      when their heads are cut off.</p>

      <p>The sage must be at least 12th level to select this esotery.</p>
