      <p>The incanter has training in the deep mysteries in magic, and his
      influence can be felt by all spell casters. As a standard action, he may
      tune himself to the environment, so that all magic flows through him. He
      must spend a standard action every round to maintain the attunement, and
      he can only be attuned for a maximum number of rounds per day equal to his
      class level + his casting ability modifier. These rounds do not need to be
      consecutive.</p>

      <p>When any enemy caster uses a sphere ability or casts a spell or
      spell-like ability, they must overcome the incanter&#8217;s influence if
      any part of their line of effect comes within 60 feet of him. If they
      succeed on a magical skill check against his magical skill defense, then
      their spell acts normally. If they fail, there are consequences.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, a failed magical skill check causes the spell to be
      weakened. The caster level of the spell is lowered by the amount the check
      was failed by. If this reduces the caster level to 0 or less, the spell is
      countered.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, a failed magical skill check causes the spell to be
      countered.</p>

      <p>At 11th level, if the incanter counters a spell, he may use an
      immediate action to redirect it to a different target as if they had been
      the original target of the spell. If an attack roll is required, he uses
      the same attack roll the original caster made.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the incanter may store a countered effect for later use.
      He may only store one spell this way, and may continue to store it for up
      to 24 hours. Using the spell is a swift action, and uses the caster level
      and casting ability modifier of the original caster, but the incanter now
      controls the ability.</p>

      <p>At 20th level, the incanter may maintain this ability as a move
      action.</p>
