      <p>At 20th level, the soul weaver may expend a soul to summon either 1
      banshee, 1 dread wraith, 2 greater shadows, 4 wraiths, 4 shadows, or 4
      poltergeists. This is similar in all other ways to summon spirit II.</p>

      <h2 id="toc23"><span>Blessing/Blight (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>All ensouled creatures are under a soul weaver&#8217;s power, and a
      soul weaver can cause incredible effects to befall both allies and
      enemies.</p>

      <p>At 2nd level, a soul weaver who chose to channel positive energy may
      grant blessings to targets, while a soul weaver who chose to channel
      negative energy may give blights. All blessings and blights may only be
      granted to living targets with souls. A target may only be under one
      blessing or blight at a time. Applying a blessing to a target with blight
      or vice-versa dispels both effects, leaving neither.</p>

      <h3 id="toc24"><span>List of Blights</span></h3>
