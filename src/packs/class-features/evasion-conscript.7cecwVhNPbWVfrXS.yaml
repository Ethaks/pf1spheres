    value: >
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, the conscript can avoid even magical and unusual
      attacks with great agility. If he succeeds at a Reflex saving throw
      against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he
      instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the conscript is
      wearing light armor or no armor. At 10th level, the conscript gains
      improved evasion; this works like evasion except while the conscript still
      takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack, he
      also only takes half damage on a failed save. A helpless conscript does
      not gain the benefits of evasion or improved evasion.</p>
