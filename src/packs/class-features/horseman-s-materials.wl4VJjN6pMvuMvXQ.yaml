      <p>The armorist&#8217;s bound and summoned armor gains the jousting and
      hosteling special abilities. Creatures contained within hosteling
      equipment are harmlessly ejected when the equipment is dismissed.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the armorist can summon or boost equipment for her mount
      (such as summoning or boosting barding) with the same speed which she may
      use for her own equipment. The armorist may even create bound equipment
      usable by her mount (such as barding), although the armorist dismounting
      counts as the item leaving her hands, causing it to disappear one round
      later if the armorist does not remount.</p>
