      <p><strong>Companion Creature (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript
      gains the Beastmastery sphere Animal Companion talent twice, giving the
      conscript a full progression animal companion. In addition, the conscript
      can use Handle Animal in place of Knowledge (nature) to identify creatures
      with the animal type, or use Ride if the animal would be a suitable
      mount.</p>

      <p><strong>Nature&#8217;s Friend (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, creatures of
      the animal type have a starting attitude toward the conscript one step
      better than normal, to a maximum of friendly. Whenever the conscript
      attempts a Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check against a
      creature that is the same type of creature as their mount or animal
      companion, they receive a competence bonus on the check equal to 1/2 their
      class level (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Beast Master (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript is
      always treated as though they rolled a natural 20 when making a Handle
      Animal, Knowledge (nature), or Ride check. In addition the conscript gains
      one of the following options:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Any creature the conscript is mounted on gains gains fast healing 5
      and a competence bonus to AC, combat maneuver defense, and all saving
      throws equal to half the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus.</li>

      <li>The conscript&#8217;s mount or animal companion improves any armor
      proficiency it may have by one step (non-proficient to light, light to
      medium, medium to heavy), and gains a competence bonus on damage rolls and
      saving throws equal to 1/2 the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus as long
      as it has line of sight to the conscript. Whenever the conscript takes
      damage from an attack while his mount or animal companion is in line of
      sight, his mount or animal companion may move up to its maximum base speed
      directly towards the conscript as an immediate action.</li>

      </ul>
