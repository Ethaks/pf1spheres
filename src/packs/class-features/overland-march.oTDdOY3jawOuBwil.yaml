      <p>The commander and any ally who can see and hear him double the maximum
      distance they can travel in an hour when walking, running, or hustling
      during overland movement. Creatures with overland flight speeds benefiting
      from this ability have their overland flight speed doubled. In addition,
      anyone benefiting from this ability can make a forced march for up to 16
      hours before needing to make a Constitution check to avoid nonlethal
      damage and fatigue.</p>
