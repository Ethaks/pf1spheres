      <p>Starting at 2nd level, the conscript can take a move action to gain the
      benefit of a combat feat he doesn&#8217;t possess. This effect lasts for 1
      minute. The conscript must meet all the feat&#8217;s prerequisites. He may
      use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 his conscript
      level (minimum 4 times per day).</p>

      <p>The conscript can use this ability again before the duration expires to
      replace the previous combat feat with another choice. If a combat feat has
      a daily use limitation (such as with Stunning Fist), any uses of that
      combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#8217;s daily
      limit.</p>

      <p>At 8th level, the conscript can use this ability to gain the benefit of
      two combat feats at the same time. He may select one feat as a swift
      action or two feats as a move action. He may use one of these feats to
      meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that he cannot
      replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#8217;s prerequisite without
      also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected
      counts toward his daily uses of this ability.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the conscript can use this ability to gain the benefit
      of three combat feats at the same time. He may select one feat as a free
      action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. He
      may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third
      feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat.
      Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this
      ability. This counts as the brawler&#8217;s martial flexibility class
      feature; characters who gain martial flexibility from multiple sources add
      their class levels from all sources that grant martial flexibility
      together when determining their total class level and uses per day for
      this ability.</p>
