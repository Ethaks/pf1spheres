      <p><strong>Fast (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter gains a +10 feet
      bonus to his base movement speed, +5 feet for every 5 incanter levels he
      possesses.</p>

      <p><strong>Retry (Su):</strong> At 8th level, as a non-action the incanter
      may force a target within 30 feet of him to reroll a dice roll they just
      made, taking the second result regardless of whether it is worse or
      better. He must decide to use this ability after the roll is made but
      before the results are revealed. He may use this ability once per day at
      8th level, plus an additional time for every 6 levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p><strong>Twist Time (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the incanter gains two
      swift actions per turn instead of one.</p>
