      <p>A symbiat of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense
      denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking him,
      unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target
      does.</p>

      <p>If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels
      from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum
      rogue level required to flank the character.</p>
