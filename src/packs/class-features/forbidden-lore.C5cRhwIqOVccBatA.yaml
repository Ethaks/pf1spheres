    value: >
      <p>Thaumaturges use bargains, secrets, and dangerous magical practices to
      push their casting to greater heights than their more careful
      contemporaries achieve. A thaumaturge may, as part of the action required
      to use a spell or sphere effect, increase his caster level by 2 for that
      effect.</p>

      <p>This applies to variables dependent on a particular casting of an
      effect (damage, duration, number of targets etc.), but it does not apply
      to the caster&#8217;s total caster level with that sphere (i.e., it does
      not determine the strength of a companion from the Conjuration sphere, nor
      to the total number of Hit Dice of reanimated creatures that may be
      controlled through the Death sphere). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th
      level, and by an additional +1 for every 4 levels thereafter to a maximum
      of +6 at 17th level.</p>

      <p>Whenever a thaumaturge uses forbidden lore to enhance their magic,
      there is a 15% chance the thaumaturge will suffer backlash; the spell or
      sphere effect does not manifest, and any spell slot or spell points spent
      are lost. In addition, the thaumaturge suffers a -1 penalty to attack
      rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and to their effective caster level
      (minimum 1), which lasts until he rests to regain spell points. This
      penalty is cumulative; every time the thaumaturge suffers backlash in a
      day, these penalties increase by 1.</p>
