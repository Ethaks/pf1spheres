      <p><strong>Chemical Specialization (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level,
      whenever the conscript throws an alchemical splash weapon and misses, he
      may select the square in which the splash weapon lands rather than
      rolling. Whenever an alchemical item created by the conscript would heal a
      creature&#8217;s hit points, any healing in excess of the creature&#8217;s
      maximum hit points is applied as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour
      per conscript class level.</p>

      <p>In addition, the conscript learns how to create an antivenom for any
      poison he can obtain a sample of. He can prepare such an antivenom in 1
      minute; if the conscript has a poison prepared from the alchemy sphere, he
      can convert it into an antivenom as a full-round action.</p>

      <p>Whenever the conscript confirms a critical with a poisoned weapon, the
      DC of the poison is increased by +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Masterful Chemistry (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the
      conscript doubles the number of formulae he can have prepared at any one
      time, and the conscript also gains a +1 to the DCs of their Alchemy sphere
      poisons.</p>

      <p><strong>Master Alchemist (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the conscript
      doubles the affected area of any splash or burst items he uses; effects
      that normally only affect a single target instead affect all targets
      within 5 ft. of the point of impact, splash damage affects all creatures
      within 10 ft. instead of 5 ft., etc. In addition, the conscript may apply
      any poison in his possession to a wielded weapon as a free action, and
      each dose of poison applied to a weapon lasts for 1 additional attack.</p>
