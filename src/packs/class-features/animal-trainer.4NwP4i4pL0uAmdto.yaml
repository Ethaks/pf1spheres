      <p>The shifter gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her shifter level to all Handle
      Animal checks. The shifter may reduce the time needed to teach an animal a
      new trick or train an animal for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week
      required by increasing the DC by +5. She can also train more than one
      animal at once, although each animal after the first adds +2 to the
      DC.</p>
