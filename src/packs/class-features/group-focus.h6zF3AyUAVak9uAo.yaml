      <p>Starting at 5th level, the commander may fly into a strenuous and
      exhausting flurry as a standard action, shouting out commands, redirecting
      attention, calling out threats, and generally imposing his will and order
      upon the battlefield, restoring the martial focus of all allies who can
      see and hear him. If an affected ally would not benefit from regaining
      martial focus, they instead gain a morale bonus to their attack rolls,
      damage rolls, saving throws, AC, and CMD equal to the higher of the
      commander&#8217;s Charisma or Intelligence bonus for 1 round. The
      commander may use this ability 1/day at 5th level, and gains an additional
      use every 6 levels thereafter.</p>
