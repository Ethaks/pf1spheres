    value: >
      <p>The armiger may add a +1 competence bonus to CMD and saves against all
      maneuvers and effects that targets her active weapon. This bonus increase
      by +1 at class level 5 and every 5 class levels thereafter. Additionally,
      she may ignore the broken condition on her customized weapons. This
      ability does not allow the armiger to benefit from any abilities that
      allow her to give the broken condition to a weapon to trigger them unless
      she chooses to suffer the normal penalties of the broken condition on that
      weapon until it is repaired.</p>
