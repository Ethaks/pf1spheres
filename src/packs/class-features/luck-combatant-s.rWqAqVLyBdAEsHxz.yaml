      <p>The technician knows how to stay one step ahead of an opponent and
      survive situations he should not be able to. His luck pool increases by 1,
      and he gains the following abilities:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Lucky Strike (Ex):</strong> Whenever the technician threatens
      a critical hit, he may spend a point of luck to roll the critical
      confirmation twice and take the better result.</li>

      <li><strong>Opportunistic Evasion (Ex):</strong> Whenever the technician
      succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an effect that deals half damage
      on a successful save, he can spend 1 luck point to instead take no damage
      for that effect.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A technician must possess the luck technical insight to gain this
      insight.</p>
