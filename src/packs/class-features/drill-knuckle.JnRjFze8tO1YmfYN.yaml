      <p>At 3rd level, a striker gains the ability to break through even the
      hardiest of foes. A striker ignores up to 2 points of damage reduction or
      hardness whenever she makes an attack with an unarmed strike. At 6th level
      and every 3 levels thereafter, she can ignore an additional 1 point of
      damage reduction or hardness.</p>
