      <p>At 4th level, after spending at least 1 minute with her vitae pool at
      0, the crimson dancer gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base land
      speed, and her next attack that applies bloodletting to a creature that
      was not bleeding deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. At 12th level
      and every 8 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +10 feet and +1d6
      respectively. These bonuses are lost after the crimson dancer gains any
      amount of vitae.</p>
