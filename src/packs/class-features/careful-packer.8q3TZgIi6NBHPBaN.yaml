      <p>The scholar knows that being prepared for any eventuality with a
      variety of useful tools is essential to success. Starting at 1st level,
      her talents for organization allow her to treat the storage space of any
      backpack, pouch, or similar container as though it were twice its normal
      size, and she uses her Intelligence score in place of her Strength score
      when determining her carrying capacity.</p>
