    value: >
      <p>At 10th level, when the wraith succeeds in actively possessing a
      target, he may choose to maintain control of that target while moving on
      to another. The wraith may choose to exit the creature, appearing in an
      adjacent square or the nearest available square. The wraith may act
      normally, dividing his actions between the actively possessed creature and
      himself. Multiple creatures may be actively possessed; actions are divided
      between all possessed creatures and the wraith. For example, if the wraith
      possesses an orc, the wraith may spend his next standard action to possess
      the nearby goblin, then move the orc up to its speed (a move action), and
      cast a quickened sphere effect (a swift action). The following round, the
      goblin could reload a light crossbow (a move action), the orc could make
      an attack action (a standard action), and the wraith would still have a
      swift action. The number of creatures possessed at one time may not exceed
      the wraith&#8217;s casting ability modifier (minimum 2). The wraith may
      choose to end his control of any possessed creature as a free action.</p>
