      <p>From 2nd level on, a conscript gains the ability to augment skill
      checks and ability checks through his brilliant inspiration. The conscript
      gains an inspiration pool equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum 1). A
      conscript&#8217;s inspiration pool refreshes each day, typically after he
      gets a restful night&#8217;s sleep. As a free action, he can expend one
      use of inspiration from his pool to add 1d6 (his inspiration die) to the
      result of a skill or ability check, including any on which he takes 10 or
      takes 20. This choice is made after the check is rolled and before the
      result is revealed. A conscript can use inspiration once only per check or
      roll.</p>

      <p>Inspiration can also be used on attack rolls and saving throws, at the
      cost of two uses of inspiration each time from the conscript&#8217;s pool.
      In the case of saving throws, using inspiration is an immediate action
      rather than a free action.</p>

      <p>This counts as the investigator&#8217;s inspiration class feature, and
      conscripts with this ability add their investigator and conscript levels
      together when determining their uses per day and other level related
      functions of this ability.</p>
