      <p>The sage learns to convert the energy of his ki blasts into healing
      positive energy. The sage may spend 1 ki point when making a ki blast
      attack to cause the attack to heal an amount of damage equal to the damage
      it would normally deal; undead creatures are instead damaged by this
      effect. The sage rolls an attack roll as normal, and the healing is
      multiplied on a critical hit just as the damage dealt would normally
      be.</p>
