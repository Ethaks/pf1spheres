      <p>The technician&#8217;s plans and creations are often halfbaked and
      highly improvised, yet somehow always seem to work out.</p>

      <p>The technician gains a pool of luck equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier
      (minimum: 1). This pool replenishes after roughly 8 hours of rest.
      Throughout the day, he may spend luck points to accomplish any of the
      following feats.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Uncanny Disarm (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, the
      technician may spend a luck point and throw an object or fire a ranged
      weapon at a trap or object within 30 ft. to attempt a Disable Device check
      to disable or sabotage it. This could include disarming a trap, jamming a
      door, causing a chandelier to fall immediately or fall in 1 round, or
      cause a mechanical object such as a siege engine or a crossbow or firearm
      to gain the broken condition. If the object to be affected is being
      carried by a creature, he must succeed at a ranged touch attack against
      the target first. He suffers a -5 penalty to his Disable Device check when
      making an Uncanny Disarm.</li>

      <li><strong>Quick Fix (Ex):</strong> The technician may spend 1 luck point
      as a move action to remove the broken condition from an object for 1
      minute.</li>

      </ul>
