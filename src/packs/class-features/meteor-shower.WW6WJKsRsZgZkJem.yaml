    value: >
      <p>The sage gains the Barrage combat sphere as a bonus sphere. If he
      already has the Barrage sphere from another source, he instead gains any
      one Barrage sphere talent he qualifies for. Whenever the sage uses his ki
      blast to attack multiple creatures as part of an attack action, he may
      attack 1 additional creature more than he would normally be able to. If
      the attack would normally target an area instead of a specific number of
      individuals, increase the base area of the effect by 5 ft. (so a 15 ft.
      cone would become a 20 ft. cone).</p>
