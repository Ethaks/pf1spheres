      <p>A mageknight gains a natural resistance to magic as she focuses on its
      use in combat. A mageknight gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws against
      spells, spell-like abilities, and magic sphere effects. This bonus
      increases by an additional +1 for every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum
      of +5 at 17th level.</p>
