      <p>An eliciter may manipulate another with little more than a look and a
      word. The eliciter targets a single creature, which must be within close
      range and able to see and hear the eliciter. Hypnotizing a target is a
      standard action. The eliciter may use hypnotism a number of times per day
      equal to 3 + 1/2 his eliciter level.</p>

      <p>When hypnotizing a target, the eliciter chooses one effect available to
      him from the list below. If this ability calls for a saving throw, the DC
      is equal to 10 + 1/2 his eliciter level + his Charisma modifier + his
      Persuasive bonus. Hypnotism is a mind-affecting ability. An eliciter may
      target himself with his own hypnotism, even if he cannot see or hear
      himself.</p>

      <p><strong>Fascinate</strong><br>

      The eliciter causes the target to become fascinated with him for 1 round
      per eliciter level (Will negates). While fascinated, a target takes no
      action except to stand or sit quietly and watch the eliciter. The target
      takes a &#8211;4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as
      Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to
      attempt a new saving throw to end the fascination effect. Any obvious
      threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a
      weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Liberate</strong><br>

      At 4th level, the eliciter may use hypnotism to free a target&#8217;s mind
      of harmful effects. The target may reroll a Will save (using the
      eliciter&#8217;s bonus if it is higher) against each harmful
      mind-affecting effect they are suffering from. The eliciter may also allow
      the target to reroll a Will save made to disbelieve an illusion, but this
      may only be used against an illusion that the eliciter has already
      successfully disbelieved.</p>

      <p><strong>Terrorize</strong><br>

      At 7th level, the eliciter may demolish the target&#8217;s mind, granting
      the target a penalty to their Will saving throws equal to his Persuasive
      bonus (no save). This lasts a number of rounds equal to his casting
      ability modifier. While a target is affected in this manner, the eliciter
      does not gain his Persuasive bonus to eliciter abilities and Mind sphere
      effects against that target.</p>

      <p><strong>Inspire Greatness</strong><br>

      At 10th level, the eliciter may use hypnotism to instill the target with
      the effects of the inspire greatness bardic performance for a number of
      rounds equal to his casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Insanity</strong><br>

      At 13th level, the eliciter may plant compulsions into the target&#8217;s
      mind to distract them. For a number of rounds equal to the
      eliciter&#8217;s casting ability modifier, the target must succeed at a
      Will save each round or suffer one of the following effects (roll a d6 to
      determine the effect):<br>

      1. take no action but to babble incoherently,<br>

      2. run away from the eliciter at top speed,<br>

      3. fall prone,<br>

      4. drop all held items and be unable to pick them back up,<br>

      5. deal 1d8 + Strength modifier damage to self with whatever is in hand as
      a standard action,<br>

      6. attack nearest creature.</p>

      <p>Each effect lasts 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Inspire Heroics</strong><br>

      At 16th level, the eliciter may grant the target the benefit of the
      inspire heroics bardic performance for a number of rounds equal to his
      Charisma modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Reverence</strong><br>

      At 19th level, the eliciter may cause the target to fall before him in
      reverence (Will negates). On a failed saving throw, the target falls prone
      and is considered helpless for 1 round per level. A flying creature
      incapable of hovering must land immediately in order to prostrate itself.
      Each round on its turn, the target may attempt a new saving throw as a
      full-round action to end the effect early. This does not provoke an attack
      of opportunity. If a creature succeeds its initial saving throw against
      this ability, it is staggered for 1 round and may not be targeted again
      with this ability until the following day.</p>
