      <p>A warden of altruism tries to remain kind and optimistic whenever they
      can, and are always a beacon of hope and generosity among their allies.
      These wardens make great healers, always trying their best to prevent pain
      and anguish wherever they go.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Life</p>

      <p><strong>Altruistic Guard:</strong> An altruistic warden&#8217;s guard
      feels warm and invigorating. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guarded
      allies gain a bonus to Fortitude saves equal to the warden&#8217;s guard
      bonus. Additionally, the warden is always aware of the condition of his
      guarded allies, as the Discern Condition Scout sphere talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Rejuvenating Presence:</strong> At 7th level, the warden may
      spend a spell point when using his patrol ability to grant all allies
      within his area of patrol fast healing equal to his casting ability
      modifier (minimum 1) until the end of his next turn. This healing cannot
      heal a creature beyond half their maximum hit points. If the warden would
      reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he can keep
      extending the duration of the ability by one additional round without
      spending a spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Sustain Harm:</strong> At 11th level, whenever an ally within
      the warden&#8217;s area of patrol suffers damage while he has a patrol
      active, he may expend an attack of opportunity to reduce the damage taken
      by an amount equal to the warden&#8217;s class level.</p>

      <p><strong>Disperse Healing:</strong> At 15th level, whenever the warden
      would recover hit points or ability damage, as a free action, he may
      divert any amount healed to any allies within his guard range. The amount
      diverted may differ for each ally, but the warden must heal at least 1 hit
      point or point of ability damage for this ability to function.</p>

      <p><strong>Lifebound Connection (Su):</strong> At 19th level, the
      warden&#8217;s guarded allies become immune to ability damage and drain
      (ignoring the effects of any ability damage or drain they may have at the
      time for the guard&#8217;s duration), in addition to maximizing any effect
      that would heal hit point damage.</p>

      <p>Additionally, all guarded allies within the warden&#8217;s guard range
      do not die until their negative hit point total exceeds twice their
      Constitution score.</p>

      <h3 id="toc44"><span><span style="color: #00c000">Vigil
      Reinforcements</span></span></h3>

      <h4 id="toc45"><span>Benevolent Guard (requires altruism)</span></h4>

      <p>The warden&#8217;s guarded allies gains a circumstance bonus to
      Diplomacy and Heal checks equal to twice the warden&#8217;s guard
      bonus.</p>

      <h4 id="toc46"><span>Transfer Affliction (requires altruism)</span></h4>

      <p>Whenever the warden&#8217;s guarded allies would be inflicted with the
      blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued,
      nauseated, paralyzed, sickened, staggered, or stunned condition, the
      warden may instead inflict this condition on himself instead of his ally
      as an immediate action. This ability does not function if the warden would
      be immune to the condition he is attempting to transfer.</p>
