      <p>Every technician knows how to create custom items, called inventions.
      Inventions could be anything from a simple improved crossbow, to a
      powerful and complex machine that to the uneducated appears to be magic.
      Inventions are finicky, improvised things that require constant tinkering
      and fixing, and there is a limit to how many a technician can maintain at
      any one time. A technician can have and maintain a maximum of 1 invention
      at 1st level, plus an additional invention at 3rd level and every 4 levels
      thereafter. If the technician has already reached this limit and wishes to
      create a new invention, he must select one of his existing inventions to
      dismantle. Whenever an invention includes an ability that calls for a
      saving throw, the DC equals 10 + 1/2 the technician&#8217;s class level +
      the technician&#8217;s Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <p>Some inventions have prerequisites, which must be met before the
      invention can be created. These prerequisites might be items, a cost in gp
      for specialty parts, or feats and skill ranks the technician must possess.
      A technician may create any invention which he meets the necessary
      prerequisites to create.</p>

      <p>Creating an invention takes 8 hours of work. The work need not be
      consecutive, and the technician can do this work while out adventuring,
      but in that situation he can only devote 4 hours each day to item
      creation, and only nets 2 hours&#8217; worth of work due to being in a
      distracting environment. Once the invention has been created, altering its
      improvements requires only 1 hour of work.</p>

      <p>See 'inventions' at the bottom of this page for more information on
      creating inventions.</p>
