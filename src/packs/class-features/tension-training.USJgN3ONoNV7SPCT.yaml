      <p>At 5th level and every six levels thereafter, a striker learns new ways
      to gain tension; she can select one of the following new methods through
      which to gain tension (a striker cannot gain tension from any of these
      more than once per round); a striker cannot regain tension if any of these
      tension training abilities are used against a helpless or unaware
      creature, or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half the
      striker&#8217;s character level:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Critical Offense:</strong> Whenever the striker confirms a
      critical hit with an unarmed strike while in the heat of combat, she gains
      1 tension.</li>

      <li><strong>Deadly Offense:</strong> Whenever the striker reduces a
      creature&#8217;s hit points to 0 or less with an unarmed strike, she gains
      1 tension.</li>

      <li><strong>Deceptive Taunt:</strong> Whenever a striker makes a
      successful Bluff check to feint in combat against a creature, she gains 1
      tension.</li>

      <li><strong>Threatening Taunt:</strong> Whenever the striker makes a
      successful Intimidate check to demoralize a creature, she gains 1
      tension.</li>

      <li><strong>Victorious Defense:</strong> Whenever the striker makes a
      successful saving throw against a non-harmless effect, she gains 1
      tension.</li>

      </ul>
