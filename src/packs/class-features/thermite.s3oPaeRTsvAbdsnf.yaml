      <p>Through delicate research into iron and aluminum interactions, the
      scholar learns of a particularly volatile reaction, allowing great
      explosive potential. The scholar can create and apply an incredibly potent
      mixture to a 5-foot square within her natural reach. Creating and applying
      this mixture takes 1 round, which provokes attacks of opportunity. The
      scholar may create a number of 5-foot squares equal to 1/2 her class level
      per day. The mixture can be set alight as part of applying the mixture (or
      if it is dealt at least 1 point of fire damage), dealing 1d8 points of
      fire damage per two class levels she possesses to the object, ignoring
      hardness equal to half her class level.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Pyrotechnic Detonation [explosive]:</strong> By adding
      thermite into her flashbangs, she can cause great devastation to those
      caught within it, allowing them to cause targets who fail their save
      against her flashbangs to be blinded for 1d4 rounds, in addition to taking
      1d8 points of fire damage per 2 class levels the scholar possesses;
      creatures who succeed at their Fortitude save against the flashbang take
      half damage from this effect. If the scholar&#8217;s flashbangs would
      normally be capable of blinding due to the scholar having at least 5 ranks
      in Craft (alchemy), the duration of this effect is doubled.</li>
