    value: >
      <p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to cause her
      armor to give off a slight glow as it becomes partially translucent. While
      in this state, she takes no armor check penalties for wearing the armor,
      nor does she take any penalties to her speed from wearing armor, and her
      Dexterity bonus to AC is unlimited. This lasts a number of minutes equal
      to her casting ability modifier.</p>
