      <p>The commander may use a standard action to allow any one creature
      currently benefiting from one of his shouts or tactics to immediately use
      an attack action as a free action that can be taken even if it&#8217;s not
      their turn. If the granted action is not taken immediately following the
      commander&#8217;s use of this ability, this effect is wasted (the
      benefiting target cannot &#8220;store&#8221; the action for use at a later
      time).</p>
