      <p>The conscript specializes in a combat sphere of his choice. When
      specializing in a sphere, the conscript gains that sphere as a bonus
      sphere at 1st level (or a combat talent belonging to that sphere if he
      already possesses that base sphere) and may treat his base attack bonus as
      being equal to his conscript level +1 when determining the benefits and
      effects of that sphere<sup>1</sup>; if a sphere would grant effects based
      on the user&#8217;s Hit Dice instead of their base attack bonus, the
      conscript may treat his total Hit Dice as being equal to his conscript
      level +1 for the purposes of determining what benefits he receives. In
      addition, he gains a series of abilities associated with that sphere as
      detailed at the end of the class.</p>

      <p><sup>1: This refers to your Base Attack Bonus from Conscript Levels. If
      you multiclass, this means you count your BAB from multiclassing normally
      and still get the +1 from Sphere Specialization for that sphere.</sup></p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> The conscript may buy an additional sphere
      specialization by trading away the bonus talents granted at 1st, 5th, 9th,
      13th, and 17th level. Sphere specializations bought in this manner are
      slightly delayed however; the conscript gains the bonus talent and
      effective base attack bonus or HD increase at 2nd level, the ability
      normally gained at 3rd level at 4th level, and the ability normally gained
      at 8th level at 9th level.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> A combat sphere specialization in a
      sphere that grants skill ranks (such as Alchemy, Fencing, etc.) allows the
      conscript to treat their effective total ranks in the sphere's associated
      skill as 1 higher for the purposes of that sphere's effects, checks made
      with the associated skill, and meeting prerequisites of feats and talents
      that require the chosen sphere. If a sphere would grant bonus skill ranks
      in multiple skills (such as Athletics sphere, or Fencing sphere's Read Foe
      talent for bonus Sense Motive ranks), the sphere specialization ability
      applies to all of those skills. For example, a conscript with the sphere
      specialization ability for the Warleader sphere would treat their ranks of
      Diplomacy as 1 higher when making checks, using Warleader sphere
      abilities, and meeting prerequisites that require the Warleader sphere
      (including feats or advanced talents). The conscript only receives these
      benefits if they would receive more skill ranks from the chosen sphere
      than their Hit Dice (such as receiving 15 skill ranks as a level 10
      conscript with the appropriate specialization would, for that sphere, be
      treated as having 11 skill ranks).</p>

      <p>Combat sphere specialization does not allow the conscript to treat
      themselves as having a permanent, above-Hit Dice base attack bonus or
      ranks of the sphere's associated skill for other purposes (such as feats,
      prestige classes, etc. that do not require the sphere chosen with combat
      sphere specialization).</p>
