      <p>The wraith may touch a willing creature as a standard action, granting
      them the benefits of his wraith form and any wraith haunts that modify it
      that the wraith possesses (such as lingering incorporeality). Either the
      creature or the wraith may end this effect as a free action. The touched
      creature expends rounds of wraith form from the wraith&#8217;s pool. The
      wraith may end this effect as a free action.</p>
