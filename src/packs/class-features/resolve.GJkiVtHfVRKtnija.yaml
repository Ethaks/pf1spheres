      <p>Starting at 1st level, the conscript gains resolve that he can call
      upon to endure even the most devastating wounds and afflictions. He can
      use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per
      day for every two conscript levels beyond 1st. Whenever the conscript
      defeats a target, he regains one daily use of his resolve, up to his
      maximum number of uses per day. Defeating a target usually involves
      reducing the target to 0 hit points or fewer, but the GM might rule that
      an enemy who surrenders or flees the battle is also defeated. He can use
      this resolve in a number of ways.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Determined:</strong> As a standard action, the conscript can
      spend one use of his resolve to remove the fatigued, shaken, or sickened
      condition. If the conscript is at least 8th level, he can alternatively
      remove the exhausted, frightened, nauseated, or staggered condition. If
      the condition has a duration longer than 1 hour or is permanent, this
      ability removes the condition for 1 hour, at which time the condition
      returns. The duration of effects suppressed by this ability continues
      during the hour in which it is suppressed.</li>

      <li><strong>Resolute:</strong> Whenever the conscript is required to make
      a Fortitude or Will save, he can spend one use of his resolve as an
      immediate action to roll twice and take the better result. He must decide
      to use this ability before he rolls the saving throw.</li>

      <li><strong>Unstoppable:</strong> When the conscript is reduced to fewer
      than 0 hit points but not slain, he can spend one use of his resolve as an
      immediate action to instantly stabilize and remain conscious. He is
      staggered, but he does not fall unconscious and begin dying if he takes a
      standard action. He does fall unconscious if he takes additional damage
      from any source, unless he spends an additional use of resolve as an
      immediate action. A conscript reduced to a sufficient number of negative
      hit points to kill him still dies as normal.</li>
