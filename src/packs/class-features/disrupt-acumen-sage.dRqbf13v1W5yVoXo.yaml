    value: >
      <p>Whenever the sage deals damage to an opponent using his chi gong
      ability, the opponent must succeed at a Will save or be unable to identify
      spells and sphere effects being cast using Spellcraft, even if normally
      able to automatically (such as when seeing a creature cast a sphere effect
      with the Magical Signs drawback) for a number of rounds equal to his
      casting ability modifier (minimum 1). The sage can spend a ki point when
      activating this ability to also have the creature be unable to benefit
      from Divination sphere abilities on a failed save for the duration.</p>
