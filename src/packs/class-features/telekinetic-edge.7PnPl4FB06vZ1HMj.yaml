      <p>At 6th level, the symbiat may push their own body or the body of a
      single willing ally with their telekinetics, making it effectively
      stronger and faster than it otherwise could be. The symbiat may affect an
      additional target at 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum
      of 5 targets at 18th level. Affected targets gain a +2 bonus to attack
      rolls and damage rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC. All affected targets
      must remain within 60 feet of the symbiat to retain these benefits.</p>
