      <p>Lead is a metal particularly problematic for practitioners of
      divination magic, foiling the magical emanations they rely upon. When the
      scholar first gains this imposition she learns how to craft a thin helmet
      liner that must use at least 10 sp worth of lead and costs 1 hour and a
      total of 100 gp times the scholar&#8217;s class level to create. A lead
      helmet liner crafted in this manner may be sold for 1/2 its crafting cost,
      as long as it is currently functioning.</p>

      <p>As long as the scholar or an ally is wearing this helmet liner, any
      effect of the Divination school or the Divination sphere that targets or
      would reveal information about them requires the caster to make a caster
      level check (if using traditional casting) or an MSB check (if using
      Spheres of Power) against a DC of 11 + the scholar&#8217;s class level or
      have the effect fail. These liners do not occupy an item slot, but wearing
      more than one has no additional effect. Because they are not true magic
      items but rather science and geometry applied in a way that interferes
      with divination magic, these liners are somewhat fragile, and they cease
      to function after they have forced casters to attempt a caster level check
      or MSB check a number of times equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence
      modifier (minimum 1), as determined at the time the liner was crafted.
      Once this limit has been reached, the liner ceases to function until the
      scholar spends at least 1 hour re-attuning it. As an immediate action, the
      scholar may expend their martial focus to quickly adjust the liner,
      causing a caster level or MSB check to not consume one of its uses.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Erratic Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar adds a
      mixture of lead, silver, salt, and other materials which naturally disrupt
      magical energies to her flashbangs. The flashbang creates a cloud of fine
      dust with a radius of 5 ft. plus 5 ft. per 5 class levels that persists a
      number of rounds equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier.
      Creatures within this cloud suffer a 50% increase to wild magic chance.
      This cloud does not obscure vision. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses
      the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1
      round. Any creature that leaves an affected square suffers a wild magic
      increase equal to half this amount until they spend a standard action or
      two move actions brushing the clinging dust off. If the scholar also
      possesses the circle of salt or silver material impositions, this wild
      magic chance increases by 25%, or by 50% if both are possessed.</li>

      </ul>
