      <p>The scholar learns how to use arcsilver to disperse and manipulate
      electricity to her advantage. The scholar may activate this imposition to
      apply arcsilver coils strategically upon her person, granting her
      electricity resistance 5 for a number of rounds equal to her practitioner
      modifier (minimum 1). This electricity resistance increases by 5 for every
      5 class levels the scholar possesses beyond 5th.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Voltaic Bursts [explosive]:</strong> The scholar may apply
      coils of arcsilver and other conductive metals to her flashbangs, allowing
      them to deal an additional 1d6 electricity damage per two class levels she
      possesses; creatures who succeed at their Fortitude save against the
      flashbang take 1/2 damage from this effect. Additionally, all creatures
      adjacent to the target must also succeed at a Reflex saving throw or
      suffer an amount of electricity damage equal to her class level as
      electricity leaps from the original target.</li>
