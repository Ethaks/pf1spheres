    value: >
      <p>As a swift action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to enter a
      rage for 1 round per mageknight level. This is similar to a
      barbarian&#8217;s rage, granting a +4 morale bonus to Strength and
      Constitution, a +2 morale bonus to Will saves, and suffering a -2 penalty
      to AC. She is under the same restrictions with skills, spells, and sphere
      abilities as a barbarian, but she may use mystic combat abilities as
      normal. She is fatigued afterward as a barbarian. She may end a rage
      prematurely as a free action.</p>
