      <p>The technician unlocks special options for his inventions, as detailed
      under that section. Whenever he creates an independent invention, he may
      give it the alchemical subtype by adding the following properties (a
      construct or independent invention cannot possess more than one
      subtype):</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Alchemy:</strong> All natural attacks made by the alchemical
      construct deal an additional 1d6 acid damage.</li>

      <li><strong>Broken Containers:</strong> Any strike on an alchemical
      construct with a melee weapon deals 1 point of acid damage to the
      attacker. This amount increases to 1d6 points of damage if the attack is a
      critical hit. Alchemical constructs are not immune to bleed damage, and if
      subject to a critical hit, they suffer 1d6 bleed damage in addition to
      other effects. It is possible to provide first aid to stop bleeding as if
      the construct were a living creature.</li>

      <li><strong>Vulnerable to Fire:</strong> Alchemical constructs take 150%
      as much damage as normal from fire attacks, unless they are immune to fire
      via other special defenses.</li>

      <li><strong>Difficult to Create:</strong> Increase the time and gp cost
      required to create an alchemical construct by 50% over normal for a
      construct.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In addition, whenever he creates an detonator, he may choose to grant
      it one of the following benefits.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Powerful:</strong> The detonator&#8217;s explosion radius
      increases to 10 ft around the square it is in, rather than 5 ft.</li>

      <li><strong>Foam:</strong> The detonator fills an area with a radius of 10
      ft, +5 ft per five class levels with foam. Any invisible creatures in the
      area at the time of the explosion are revealed for 1 minute per class
      level, or until the creature spends a full-round action wiping it off. Any
      invisible creature who enters this area leaves footprints behind,
      revealing their location so long as they remain in the foam-covered area.
      The foam dissipates on its own after 1 minute per level. The technician
      may choose to have this detonator not deal damage. Instead, the foam makes
      all affected creatures entangled, and all creatures who are within the
      blast radius or who enter the area while the foam remains must pass a
      Reflex save or be stuck in place until the foam is removed. This foam may
      also be burned or cut with a slashing weapon, and each 5 ft. square
      possesses 5 hp per technician level.</li>

      <li><strong>Flare:</strong> The detonator sheds bright light for 30 ft +5
      ft per two class levels, and increasing the light level by one step to a
      maximum of normal for 30 ft +5 ft per two class levels beyond this for 1
      minute per class level. The technician may choose to have this detonator
      not deal damage. Instead, all creatures within the area of bright light
      must pass a Fortitude save each round they are within this area or be
      blinded for 1 round.</li>

      <li><strong>Incendiary:</strong> The detonator deals all fire damage
      instead of half fire/half piercing, and any flammable materials within its
      area of effect catch fire. Creatures who fail their Reflex save are also
      set on fire.</li>

      <li><strong>Smoke:</strong> The detonator fills a 5 ft. radius + 5 ft per
      five levels with harmless smoke. The smoke obscures all sight, including
      darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment
      (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total
      concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can&#8217;t use sight to
      locate the target). The smoke remains for 1 minute per level. A moderate
      wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph)
      disperses the smoke in 1 round. The technician may choose to have this
      detonator not deal damage. Instead, all creatures within the blast area or
      who enter the area must pass a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4+1
      rounds. If a creature stays in this area for multiple rounds they must
      make an additional save each round or be sickened. If a target is already
      sickened and enters the area or stays in the area for an additional round,
      they must pass a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.</li>

      </ul>
