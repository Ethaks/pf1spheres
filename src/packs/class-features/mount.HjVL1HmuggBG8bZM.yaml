      <p>The conscript gains Ride as a class skill.</p>

      <p>In addition, the conscript gains a mount. This functions as a
      druid&#8217;s animal companion, using the conscript&#8217;s level as his
      effective druid level. This grants the conscript the service of a loyal
      and trusty steed to carry him into battle. The creature must be one that
      he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. GMs should approve
      suitable mounts.</p>

      <p>The conscript does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while
      riding this mount. The conscript&#8217;s mount is always considered combat
      trained and gains Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat.</p>

      <p>If the conscript releases their mount or their mount dies, they may
      find a new mount after 1 week. If the conscript is in the environment
      where the new mount typically lives or is domesticated, the conscript may
      instead gain their new mount in 24 hours.</p>
