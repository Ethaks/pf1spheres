    value: >
      <p>You gain Consumptive Intuition as a bonus feat. When you consume a
      creature&#8217;s brain, you may add that brain to a repository of
      knowledge known as your brain pool. The talents gained from Consumptive
      Intuition may be gained from any creature whose brain you have in your
      brain pool rather than the last creature whose brain you have consumed
      (for example, if you possess four instances of the Consumptive Intuition
      feat, you may use these feats to gain 2 talents from one brain, 1 talent
      from a second brain, and 1 talent from a third brain). The number of
      brains you may have in your brain pool is equal to your casting ability
      modifier + the number of times you have taken the Consumptive Intuition
      feat. You may select this bestial trait multiple times, each time gaining
      Consumptive Intuition as a bonus feat an additional time.</p>
