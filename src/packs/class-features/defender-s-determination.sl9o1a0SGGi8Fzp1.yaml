      <p>At 7th level, whenever a sentinel uses her second wind, she can also
      ignore the following conditions for 1 minute: blinded, deafened,
      entangled, fatigued, sickened, shaken, or staggered. Once a specific
      instance of a condition has been ignored by this ability, it cannot be
      ignored again for 24 hours, or until she has rested for 8 hours (whichever
      comes first). She can also spend an additional point of reserve while
      using her second wind to ignore the normal limitations on how much she can
      heal with it.</p>
