      <p>At 1st level, the conscript gains the Fencing sphere as a bonus
      sphere.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, the conscript gains the swashbuckler&#8217;s panache
      class feature, using his practitioner modifier in place of Charisma for
      his panache pool and to determine the effects of deeds. The conscript may
      use any melee weapon wielded in one hand (though not natural weapon
      attacks) as though it were a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon for
      the purposes of abilities gained from this specialization. If the
      conscript would gain another grit, panache, or other similar pool from
      other conscript specializations, they stack into a combined pool. The
      conscript gains the following swashbuckler deeds: dodging panache,
      menacing swordplay, and swashbuckler initiative. The conscript may spend 1
      panache point instead of expending martial focus for the Parry And Riposte
      Fencing talent. If he does, the conscript does not regain martial focus
      from the Parry And Riposte talent, but may still make a single melee
      attack against a creature whose attack the conscript successfully parries,
      if able.</p>

      <p>At 6th level, while the conscript has at least 1 panache point, the
      conscript deals additional damage with any one-handed melee weapon (though
      not natural weapon attacks), adding half his practitioner modifier
      (minimum 1) to the damage dealt. This additional damage is precision
      damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit. The conscript does not
      add this damage if he attacks with a weapon using any other hand or uses a
      shield other than a buckler. The conscript can add this damage to thrown
      light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is
      within 30 feet of him.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, the conscript gains the following swashbuckler deeds:
      evasive, subtle blade, and swashbuckler&#8217;s grace.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If the conscript has the blackpowder training
      specialization, he does not lose the bonus precision damage with his light
      or one-handed piercing melee weapon when he uses a firearm in his other
      hand.</p>
