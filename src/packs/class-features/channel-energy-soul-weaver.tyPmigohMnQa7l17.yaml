    value: >
      <p>A soul weaver may summon waves of spiritual energy that affect nearby
      creatures. This is identical to the cleric class feature. She may use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier
      (minimum 1). She must choose at 1st level whether to channel positive or
      negative energy, after which this decision may not be changed. A soul
      weaver&#8217;s choice to channel positive or negative energy is not
      connected to their alignment, and any soul weaver may channel either
      energy.</p>
