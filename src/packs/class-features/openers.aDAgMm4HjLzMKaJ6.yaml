      <p>An opener begins a new sequence. A newly started sequence is one link
      in length. The following are basic openers:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Dealing damage to one or more hostile
      creatures with an attack action, charge attack (performed as a standard or
      full-round action), with a sphere ability with a casting time of a
      standard action or greater, or with another ability with a standard action
      or greater activation time.</li>

      <li><strong>Critical Hit:</strong> Confirming a critical hit against a
      hostile creature.</li>

      <li><strong>Defeat:</strong> Reducing a hostile creature with a CR equal
      to or greater than half the prodigy&#8217;s character level to 0 or fewer
      hit points.</li>

      <li><strong>Heal:</strong> Restore hit points to an ally or remove ability
      drain, ability damage, or the blinded, dazed, frightened, nauseated,
      shaken, sickened, or stunned conditions with an ability that requires at
      least a standard action.</li>

      <li><strong>Maneuver:</strong> Succeeding on a combat maneuver check
      against a hostile creature.</li>

      <li><strong>Magic Save:</strong> A hostile creature failing a save against
      a magic sphere effect. This sphere effect must have a casting time of a
      standard action or greater. This opener may only be used the first time
      any hostile creature fails a save against that casting.</li>

      <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Successfully use the reflect spell class
      feature.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Some abilities, such as possessing certain spheres, may grant
      additional opener options. Such options have the (opener) tag.</p>
