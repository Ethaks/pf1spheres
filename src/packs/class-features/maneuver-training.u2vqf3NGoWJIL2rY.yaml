    value: >
      <p>At 3rd level, a conscript can select one combat maneuver to receive
      additional training. They gain a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when
      performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to their CMD when defending
      against that maneuver.</p>

      <p>At 8th level and every four levels thereafter, the conscript becomes
      further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus
      combat maneuver checks and to CMD with that maneuver. In addition, the
      bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For
      example, if a conscript chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 8th
      level, their bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If
      they then choose bull rush upon reaching 12th level, their bonuses to
      grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)</p>
