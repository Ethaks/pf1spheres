      <p><strong>Animal Companion (Ex):</strong> Beginning at 3rd level, the
      incanter gains an animal companion, as the druid class feature, treating
      his incanter levels as druid levels for this purpose.</p>

      <p><strong>Empower Companion (Su):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter may
      touch an animal to infuse it with power. The animal immediately gains the
      advanced creature simple template: it gains a +2 bonus on all rolls,
      including damage rolls and special ability DCs, a +4 bonus to AC and CMD,
      and +2 hit points per Hit Die. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to
      his casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p>During this time, the animal&#8217;s primal instincts take hold for the
      duration of this spell&#8212;if the animal knows tricks granted by the
      Handle Animal skill, it loses access to all of those tricks save for
      &#8220;attack.&#8221; Animals that already have the advanced creature
      template are unaffected by this ability. He may use this ability once per
      day, plus an additional time per day for every 6 levels beyond 8th.</p>

      <p><strong>Life Connection:</strong> At 20th level, the incanter may
      transfer up to half of any hit point damage dealt to himself to his animal
      companion.</p>
