      <p>At 7th level, the symbiat may create an effect similar to the share
      expertise psionic effect, except instead of sharing ranks in a skill with
      his allies, the symbiat shares one feat he possesses. All allies within 60
      feet gain the benefits of that feat, even if they do not meet that
      feat&#8217;s prerequisites. At 14th level, the symbiat may choose a feat
      possessed by any of his affected allies instead of one he possesses and
      grant that feat to himself and his other allies instead.</p>
