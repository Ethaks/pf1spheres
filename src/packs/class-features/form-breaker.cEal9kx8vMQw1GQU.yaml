      <p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to empower her
      next attack with magical energies disruptive to shapechangers. If the
      attack successfully strikes a creature under a polymorph effect (such as
      shapeshift, beast shape spells, polymorph, or change shape), she may
      attempt a magical skill check against the effect&#8217;s MSD. She gains a
      +4 bonus on this check. If successful, the polymorph effect immediately
      ends and the target cannot benefit from polymorph effects for a number of
      rounds equal to her CAM.</p>
