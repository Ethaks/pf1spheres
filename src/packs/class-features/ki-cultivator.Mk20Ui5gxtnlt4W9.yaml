    value: >
      <p>At 3rd level, a conscript gains a pool of ki points, supernatural
      energy they can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a
      conscript&#8217;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 their conscript level + their
      practitioner modifier. As long as they have at least 1 point in their ki
      pool, they can make a ki strike.</p>

      <p>At 3rd level, ki strike allows their unarmed attacks to be treated as
      magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>At 7th level, their unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and
      silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>

      <p>At 10th level, their unarmed attacks are also treated as weapons of an
      alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that the conscript has for the
      purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment is chosen when this
      ability is gained.</p>

      <p>At 16th level, their unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons
      for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.</p>

      <p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or
      meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. Starting at 3rd
      level and every odd level thereafter, the conscript may select a ki power
      from the unchained monk&#8217;s list of ki powers in place of the bonus
      talent they gain at that level, treating their conscript level as their
      unchained monk level and using their practitioner modifier in place of
      their Wisdom modifier when determining the effects of ki powers the
      conscript gains. Some ki powers require the conscript to be of a specific
      level or higher before they can be chosen.</p>
