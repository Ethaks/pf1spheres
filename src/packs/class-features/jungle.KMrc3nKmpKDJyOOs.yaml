      fighting and turn them into tactical advantages. When fighting or
      traveling in jungle terrain, the commander and any ally affected by one of
      his tactics or shouts gain a bonus to saving throws against poisons and
      diseases equal to the greater of the commander&#8217;s Charisma or
      Intelligence modifiers (minimum +1), increase their base Climb speed by 10
      ft. (or gain a Climb speed of 10 ft. if they do not already have one), and
      gain a bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to 1/2 the commander&#8217;s class
      level.</p>
