    value: >
      <p>The sage may spend a ki point when making a ki blast attack to treat
      his ki blast as a scatter weapon for 1 round; while this effect is active
      his ki blast attacks target all creatures within a 15 ft. cone, making a
      separate attack roll against each creature within the cone. Each attack
      roll takes a &#8211;2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by
      precision damage or damage-increasing feats. Effects that grant
      concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror
      image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. If any of the attack rolls
      threaten a critical, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. At
      6th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the size of the scatter cone
      increases by an additional 10 ft., though the sage may always choose to
      forego these increases when making a scatter attack.</p>
