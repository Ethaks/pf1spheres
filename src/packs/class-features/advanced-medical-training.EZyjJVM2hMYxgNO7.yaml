      <p>From 5th level on, the scholar&#8217;s research has taught her advanced
      medical techniques for treating certain ailments; the scholar may expend 5
      uses of a healer&#8217;s kit as a standard action that provokes attacks of
      opportunity and make a DC 20 Heal check to cure any one of the following
      conditions affecting a creature: blindness, deafness, paralysis, or
      poison. For each 10 points by which the scholar exceeds the DC of this
      check, she may cure an additional condition from the list that the target
      is suffering as part of the same check. If the scholar has at least 8
      ranks in the Heal skill, she may instead use this ability to restore 1
      point of ability drain +1 point for every 5 points by which she exceeds
      this ability&#8217;s DC.</p>

      <p>The scholar can only attempt to heal a particular creature with this
      ability a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence bonus (minimum
      1). Attempting to heal a creature but failing to meet the DC of this
      ability still counts towards this daily total. In addition, the scholar
      increases healing done by the hit point healing option of the medical
      training class feature to 2 hit points +2 for each point by which the
      scholar exceeds the DC, and may activate it as a move action.</p>
