      <p>The mageknight may add her level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump,
      both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, she always
      counts as having a running start when attempting jump checks using
      Acrobatics. By spending 1 spell point as a swift action, she may gain a
      +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round.</p>
