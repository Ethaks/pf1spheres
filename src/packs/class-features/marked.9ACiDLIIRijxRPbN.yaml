    value: >
      <p>At 7th level, a mageknight who successfully deals damage with a weapon
      or natural attack to a target may, as a swift action, leave a magical mark
      on that target. The target suffers a -2 penalty to saving throws against
      the spells, spelllike abilities, and sphere abilities of the mageknight,
      and the mageknight gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against the spells,
      spell-like abilities, and sphere abilities of the target. This mark lasts
      for 1 minute. The mageknight may not have more than 1 mark active at a
      time; giving a second mark causes the first to be dismissed.</p>
