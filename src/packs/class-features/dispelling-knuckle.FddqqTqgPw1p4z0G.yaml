      <p>The striker can spend 3 tension whenever she makes a successful attack
      against a creature or object to treat the results of that attack roll as a
      caster level check against 1 spell as though using the targeted dispel
      option of dispel magic or the Counterspell feat; if this attempt fails,
      the striker cannot use this striker art against that creature or object
      for 24 hours. At 8th level and every 4 levels afterwards, she can dispel
      an additional spell with this ability as though using greater dispel magic
      or the Improved Counterspell feat.</p>
