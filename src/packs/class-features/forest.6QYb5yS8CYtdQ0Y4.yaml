      <p>The commander has become an expert at fighting in forested terrain,
      learning to leverage the forest&#8217;s cover and bounty to his advantage.
      When fighting or traveling in forested terrain, the commander and any ally
      affected by one of his tactics or shouts are treated as having the evasion
      ability while standing in the same square as a tree, do not have the DC of
      Acrobatics checks increased due to undergrowth or heavy undergrowth, and
      need only spend two squares of movement to move into heavy
      undergrowth.</p>
