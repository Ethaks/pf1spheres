      affected by one of his tactics or shouts are treated as having the evasion
      ability while standing in the same square as a tree, do not have the DC of
      Acrobatics checks increased due to undergrowth or heavy undergrowth, and
      need only spend two squares of movement to move into heavy
      undergrowth.</p>
