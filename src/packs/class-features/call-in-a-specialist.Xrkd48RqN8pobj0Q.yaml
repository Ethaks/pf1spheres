      <p>The commander makes many contacts over the course of his career,
      including individuals with unique skill sets capable of turning the tide
      of a critical battle or provide crucial information. Once per week, the
      commander may spread the word in any small town or larger settlement that
      he is looking for such a specialist to aid in a particular task.</p>

      <p>The specialist appears within 24 hours, minus 1 hour for each level the
      commander possesses (minimum time until appearance of 1 hour). The
      specialist stays until their task (as described in their entry) is
      completed, or for a number of days equal to 1/2 the commander&#8217;s
      class level, whichever comes first.</p>

      <p>Specialists whose services are acquired in this way generally will not
      become directly involved in combat; if forced into a situation where
      combat is inevitable, they will fight to protect themselves but will
      otherwise avoid conflict. If a specialist is killed in the course of
      performing their services as defined in this ability, the commander must
      wait 1 month before another specialist will work with him again. Each time
      the commander uses this ability, he chooses a particular type of
      specialist from the following list:</p>

      <h5 id="toc33"><span>Equipment Specialist</span></h5>

      <p>The commander gains the services of a blacksmith whose class level is
      equal to the commander&#8217;s class level -3. This equipment specialist
      will use his maintenance class feature for the commander and up to 5 other
      individuals in preparation for the following day. In addition, the
      blacksmith can use his reforge ability to repair or reforge one magic
      weapon in the commander&#8217;s possession.</p>

      <h5 id="toc34"><span>Information Specialist</span></h5>

      <p>The commander gains the services of a bard or rogue whose class level
      is equal to the commander&#8217;s class level -3. This information
      specialist can perform one of two services; first, they can provide the
      commander with a detailed map of the local town or city, including hidden
      passages, sewer passageways (if any), guild hall locations (both
      legitimate businesses and illicit organizations such as thieves guilds),
      and other relevant points of interest. Secondly, they can spend 5 days
      studying a single city block, or one major figure in their town or city;
      if they study a city block, they provide basic information about all
      traffic that moves in or out of this area, including what races and in
      what numbers, any traps or particularly dangerous individuals who frequent
      the area, and any other major points of interest. If they study a
      particular individual or citizen they gain detailed information about the
      figure including their friends and contacts, any significant abilities
      possessed by the individual (such as martial prowess or spellcasting), any
      weapons or possessions of particular note or value, and any addictions,
      habits, or other social weaknesses the individual possesses.</p>

      <h5 id="toc35"><span>Medical Specialist</span></h5>

      <p>The commander gains the services of a cleric or scholar whose class
      level is equal to the commander&#8217;s class level -3. This medical
      specialist will provide medical treatment to the commander and up to 5
      other individuals, using any abilities they possess to heal the injuries
      and negative conditions affecting these targets. The commander must still
      pay for any expensive material components necessary for spells or
      abilities the medical specialist performs.</p>

      <h5 id="toc36"><span>Scouting Specialist</span></h5>

      <p>The commander gains the services of a hunter or ranger whose class
      level is equal to the commander&#8217;s class level -3. This scouting
      specialist can perform one of two services; first, they can provide the
      commander with a detailed map of nearby wilderness territory, including
      pathways, dungeons, and the lairs of dangerous beasts. The scouting
      specialist can successfully map up to 1 square mile of territory each day.
      Secondly, they can spend 5 days studying a wilderness area of 1 square
      mile or less, or a single creature; if they study a particular creature,
      at the end of this period they provide detailed information about it to
      the commander, including its current condition, weaknesses, spell-like or
      supernatural abilities, and its habits and daily routine (where it goes
      and why).</p>

      <p>If they study a particular area, they provide basic information on all
      creatures that move through that territory, including species and
      approximate number, any hazards or pitfalls in the area, and any other
      items of particular interest.</p>
