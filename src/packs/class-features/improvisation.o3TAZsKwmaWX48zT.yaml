      <p>When the troubadour creates a disguise through the Disguise skill that
      is not a persona, that disguise counts as a persona for the purpose of
      other actor trainings that improve personas such as True Disguise or True
      Intent. The improvised persona does not, however, gain the benefits of the
      method acting class feature.</p>

      <p>When discarding an old persona to create a new persona, the troubadour
      only needs 2 days to create a new persona rather than 5 days.</p>
