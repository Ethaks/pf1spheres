      <p><strong>Always Ready (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the conscript gains a
      +2 bonus to his initiative rolls and the first damage roll he makes during
      combat. If his hands are open and he is aware of the enemy, he may draw a
      ranged weapon as part of making his initiative roll.</p>

      <p><strong>Startling Barrage (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a
      conscript successfully attacks an unaware creature with a ranged or thrown
      weapon, that creature remains flat-footed until the beginning of their
      next round.</p>

      <p><strong>Barrage Beast (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript strikes a target at least twice during a barrage, he deals an
      additional +4d6 points of precision damage on each attack after the first;
      this stacks with precision damage from other sources, such as a
      rogue&#8217;s sneak attack.</p>
