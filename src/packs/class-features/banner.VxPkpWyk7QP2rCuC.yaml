      <p>From 2nd level on, the conscript gains a banner that becomes a symbol
      of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the
      conscript&#8217;s banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 ft.
      receive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale
      bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 6th level, and every
      four levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be
      at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the conscript
      or a creature he is currently using as a mount.</p>
