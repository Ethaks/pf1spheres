      <p>The wraith may target an unwilling creature with Share Wraith Form via
      a melee touch attack. A successful Will save negates this effect. An
      unwilling creature cannot choose to end this effect, though the wraith may
      end it normally. The target creature may attempt a new Will save each
      round as a full-round action to end the effect early. This wraith haunt
      may be taken a second time to allow the wraith to use this ability with a
      ranged touch attack with a range of close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 class
      levels).</p>
