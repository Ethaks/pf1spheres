      <p><strong>Well Equipped (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript gains a
      +1 competence bonus to attack and damage rolls with any weapon with which
      he is proficient; at 10th level, this bonus increases by +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Guarding Gear (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the conscript
      gains a competence bonus to his CMD equal to his practitioner
      modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Well Studied (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a conscript
      rolls to confirm a critical hit with a manufactured weapon, he can roll
      twice and select the better result. While wearing any armor or carrying a
      shield, the conscript is treated as though they had the heavy
      fortification armor special ability.</p>
