      <p>The prodigy may open her mind to a flash of insight, temporarily
      discovering skills she didn&#8217;t know she had. At 2nd level, as a
      standard action, the prodigy may grant himself the benefit of any one
      magic talent or combat talent she doesn&#8217;t possess. This effect lasts
      for 1 minute. The prodigy must possess that talent&#8217;s base sphere and
      meet any prerequisites (if an advanced talent). The prodigy may use this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her class level.
      Multiple uses of this ability do not stack. If the prodigy uses this
      ability again before the previous duration has expired, it replaces the
      previous use.</p>
