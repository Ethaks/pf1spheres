    value: >
      <p>At 20th level, a striker gains 7 tension at the start of her first turn
      in combat (including surprise rounds). She also has no limit to how much
      tension she can possess, and if she possesses the high tension striker
      art, she can immediately swap it for another striker art. The striker also
      reduces the cost of all abilities which require tension by 1, to a minimum
      of 1.</p>
