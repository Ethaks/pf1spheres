    value: >
      <p>The wraith may spend a spell point to passively possess an object for
      up to 1 hour per level. Attended objects receive a Will save. The object
      can be no smaller than Tiny and no larger than Huge. At level 10, the
      minimum object size decreases to Diminutive and the maximum increases to
      Gargantuan. The wraith retains his normal senses while possessing an
      object.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the wraith may designate a single object within the
      normal limits as his refuge. Passively possessing the refuge does not
      require a spell point. Designating an object as a refuge requires a 1-hour
      ritual. Designating a new object causes any previous refuges to cease
      functioning as a refuge. The wraith may speak in his normal voice while in
      his refuge object.</p>
