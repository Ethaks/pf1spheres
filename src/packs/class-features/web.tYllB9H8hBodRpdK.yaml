      <p>The shifter may create webs as the Web trait from the Vermin
      Transformation Alteration talent. This ability is usable 8 times per day,
      rather than once per minute.</p>

      <h2 id="toc76"><span>Endurance (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 3rd level the shifter gains Endurance as a bonus feat.</p>

      <h2 id="toc77"><span>Lingering Transformation</span></h2>

      <p>At 4th level, when the shifter applies a shapeshift to herself and
      maintains it through concentration or decides not to maintain the
      shapeshift at all, the shapeshift lasts an additional number of rounds
      equal to 1/2 her shifter level before ending.</p>

      <h2 id="toc78"><span>Enhanced Attacks (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>Starting at 4th level, the shifter&#8217;s magic begins to augment her
      natural attacks, in both her normal and transformed shapes. All the
      shifter&#8217;s natural attacks are treated as magic weapons for the
      purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level they are treated as
      cold iron and silver weapons. At 10th level, the shifter has come to
      embody fluidity so much that her natural attacks are treated as chaotic
      weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level,
      they are treated as adamantine weapons for this purpose.</p>

      <h2 id="toc79"><span>Steal Language (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At 5th level, a shifter can not only change her body, but also her
      mind. The shifter may touch a target, gaining for 24 hours the ability to
      speak and understand one language that creature speaks. This can work on
      animals and other creatures that do not have a language, but only allows
      communication with that particular type of creature (eagle, dog, wolf,
      etc.). She may only have one language acquired at a time in this manner;
      acquiring a second language dismisses the first.</p>

      <h2 id="toc80"><span>Enhanced Physicality (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 7th level, the shifter&#8217;s body begins to become naturally
      enhanced through her transformations. She gains a +2 inherent bonus to her
      Constitution score. This increases to +4 at 13th level, and +6 at 19th
      level.</p>

      <h2 id="toc81"><span>Immunity to Poison (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 8th level, the shifter gains immunity to all poisons.</p>

      <h2 id="toc82"><span>Extended Transformation (Sp)</span></h2>

      <p>At 9th level, the shifter&#8217;s control over Alteration magic makes
      her transformations unusually powerful. Whenever the shifter spends a
      spell point to allow a shapeshift to continue without concentration, the
      effect lasts for 10 minutes per level instead of 1 minute per level.</p>

      <h2 id="toc83"><span>Boundless Communication (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 11th level, the shifter&#8217;s ability to communicate increases.
      She may understand and be understood by any creature with a language.</p>

      <h2 id="toc84"><span>Immunity to Disease (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 12th level, the shifter gains immunity to all diseases, including
      magical diseases.</p>

      <h2 id="toc85"><span>Endless Communication (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 15th level, the shifter&#8217;s communicative powers encompasses all
      life. She may communicate with and understand any living creature, even
      those without languages such as animals and plants.</p>

      <h2 id="toc86"><span>Greater Transformation (Su)</span></h2>

      <p>At 17th level, whenever the shifter spends a spell point to allow a
      shapeshift to endure without concentration, the effect lasts for 1 hour
      per level.</p>

      <h2 id="toc87"><span>Second Skin (Ex)</span></h2>

      <p>At 20th level the shifter becomes a master of Alteration magic.
      Whenever she changes her own form with a shapeshift it is considered an
      extraordinary ability instead of a magical effect. This means it does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity, cannot be dispelled or countered, and
      can be used within an antimagic field. Changes to herself have an
      unlimited duration without the need to spend any spell points.</p>
