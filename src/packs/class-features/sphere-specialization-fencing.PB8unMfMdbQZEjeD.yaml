      <p><strong>Subtlety (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, the conscript treats
      Bluff as a class skill. If he already has Bluff as a class skill, he may
      instead treat any one other skill of his choice as a class skill. In
      addition, the conscript gains a competence bonus on Bluff checks equal to
      1/4 his base attack bonus (minimum +1).</p>

      <p><strong>Agile Defense (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a conscript
      successfully damages a creature with an attack that deals precision
      damage, he gains a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against all attacks from the
      damaged creature for 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Shadowed Defense (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the
      conscript succeeds at a feint attempt against a creature, he also gains
      concealment against all attacks made by that creature until the start of
      his next turn.</p>
