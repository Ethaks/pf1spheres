      <p>The technician knows how to use showmanship to his advantage. His luck
      pool increases by 1 point, and he gains the following abilities:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Manipulative (Ex):</strong> Whenever the technician makes a
      Bluff check or Sense Motive check, he may spend 1 point of luck to roll
      the dice twice and take the better result. He must choose to use this
      ability before the dice are rolled.</li>

      <li><strong>Lucky Distraction (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, the
      technician may make a Bluff check to make a distraction opposed by the
      Sense Motive skill of all creatures within 30 ft. All creatures who fail
      this check do not see him, allowing him to hide from them via the Stealth
      skill. In addition, all creatures who fail this check are considered to
      have been successfully feinted, losing their Dexterity bonus vs. his next
      attack, as well as any other benefits associated with his feint.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A technician must possess the luck technical insight to gain this
      insight.</p>
