    value: >
      <p>At 2nd level and higher, a symbiat&#8217;s added senses allow him to
      avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he succeeds
      at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage
      on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only
      if the symbiat is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless symbiat does
      not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
