      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bluff 3 ranks; Deceitful or Skill Focus
      (Bluff); Iron Will.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you succeed at a Will saving throw made
      against any magical effect, the caster of that effect does not
      automatically know you have succeeded at your saving throw. This allows
      you to attempt a Bluff check against their Sense Motive check to convince
      them that you failed your saving throw and are under the effects of the
      magic. You can choose to allow supplementary effects of the magic (such as
      the telepathic link provided by the dominate person spell or the Mind
      Control advanced Mind talent) to function as if you had failed your saving
      throw, to aid in the deception. You may dismiss the supplementary effect
      early as a standard action.</p>
