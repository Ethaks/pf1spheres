      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Enhanced Contingency (see <a
      href="/enhancement">Enhancement</a> feats).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain the following enhancements, which
      may be used to enhance sphere abilities augmented by Contingency.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Introduce Flexibility:</strong> You may spend 1 spell point to
      enhance a contingency, granting it an additional trigger&#8211; this
      additional trigger must be a valid condition, as defined by the
      Contingency feat. If either condition is met, the contingent sphere
      ability triggers immediately.</li>

      <li><strong>Suppress Triggers:</strong> You may spend 1 spell point to
      enhance a contingency, removing its trigger condition for the duration.
      You may only target your own contingencies or any other contingencies that
      you know the trigger condition for.</li>

      </ul>
