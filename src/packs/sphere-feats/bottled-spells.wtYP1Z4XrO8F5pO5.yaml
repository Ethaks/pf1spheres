      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Charged Spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can imbue a consumable item (such as a
      fluid or an easy to break trinket) with a charged sphere ability. When you
      create a charge, you also create a small item such as a pill, pebble, or a
      pinch of dust in which to store that charge.</p>

      <p>These items are considered to have negligible cost, and an individual
      item can only store a single charge. The consumable remains potent until
      you rest and regain spell points, and possesses an aura as if it were the
      original target of the effect. Such an item can be dispelled as normal for
      the effect even in its inactive state. Effects with a duration of
      &#8216;concentration&#8217; cannot be imbued into items.</p>

      <p>Any creature, not just yourself, can use the charge by using the item
      (eating the pill, spreading the dust, throwing the pebble, etc.) This
      requires the same action as the sphere effect would normally require.</p>

      <p>The user is considered the creator of the spell, and can do whatever
      the creator can with the spell, including dismissing it, moving it (if it
      can be moved), or any other effect that can take place after the ability
      has been created. However, the charge still uses your caster level, spell
      DC, casting ability modifier, concentration and magical skill bonus
      (determined at the time of the charge&#8217;s creation).</p>
