      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Deceitful, caster level 1st.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When creating a magical sphere effect, you
      can attempt a Bluff check (opposed by observers&#8217; Perception checks)
      to conceal your actions from onlookers.</p>

      <p>Every drawback possessed that could be heard or seen (materials,
      somatic components, verbal components, requiring a focus, etc.) imposes a
      cumulative -4 penalty to this Bluff check.</p>

      <p>If the magic sphere effect is obvious (such as a summoned creature or a
      destructive blast), you also take a &#8211;4 penalty on the Bluff check,
      and even if your check is successful, observers still see the effect
      (though they fail to notice that you are responsible for it).</p>
