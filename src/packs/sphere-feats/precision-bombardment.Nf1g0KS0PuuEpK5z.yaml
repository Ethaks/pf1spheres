      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Created Momentum).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using create to drop objects on a target
      or attack them with Created Momentum and are doing so in a way that
      targets normal AC, you may treat the attack as a weapon attack roll for
      all purposes; you may apply feats to your attack as you could with any
      ranged weapon, and may treat creating and dropping a single object on a
      target as a standard action as an attack action. Dropping the object has
      its range increment increased to 40 feet just as when using it as a
      weapon. Additional damage from feats or talents such as Deadly Aim or
      Vital Strike is not multiplied based on hardness or falling distance.</p>
