      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Warleader sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have a squadron of allies who experience
      greater benefits from your tactics. Your squadron includes yourself and up
      to 3 additional allies, plus an additional ally for every 5 ranks in
      Diplomacy. You can change membership any time you get a full-night&#8217;s
      rest, but you must touch the ally to add it to your squadron. You must
      spend 1 minute every day renewing the links between you and your squad
      members. You must have access to each member you wish to include.</p>

      <p>Squad member allies must be specific individuals. Allies can include
      summoned companions that are effectively the same creature being summoned
      each time (such as the companion summoned with the Conjuration sphere),
      but not spontaneously created creatures. Alternatively, instead of adding
      any additional allies, you may include one crew or troop. For example, if
      you have 5 ranks in Diplomacy your squad may be made up either yourself
      and four additional allies, or yourself and one crew or troop.</p>

      <p>Members of your squadron gain increased bonuses from your tactics. If a
      tactic grants a bonus to any d20 roll or any number that is the target of
      a d20 roll (such as AC, attack rolls, saving throws, CMB, CMD, ability
      checks, skill checks, concentration checks, or spell penetration checks),
      that bonus increases by +1, and an additional +1 for every 10 ranks in
      Diplomacy you possess.</p>

      <p>For the purpose of determining how many additional allies you may have
      in a squadron, this feat doesn&#8217;t stack with Squadron Commander, but
      this feat counts as Squadron Commander for the purpose of feats and other
      elements with Squadron Commander as a prerequisite.</p>
