      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Magic skill bonus +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> A creature with the Forge Charm feat knows
      how to add permanent enhancements and effects to an item, such that
      whoever wears or uses that item gains that bonus for as long as they are
      wearing or using that item.</p>

      <p>When forging a charm, the crafter must possess the base sphere
      associated with the charm to be made. The base cost of a charm, as well as
      the minimum magic skill bonus required, vary depending on the type of
      charm being made. As always, crafting a charm costs 1/2 the base cost.</p>

      <p>A charm uses the crafter&#8217;s MSB rather than their caster level
      when determining the maximum caster level charm they can create. The
      item&#8217;s minimum caster level is determined by the charm being
      created, as detailed below. If the item possess multiple charms or other
      enchantments, use the higher caster level of all included
      enchantments.</p>

      <p><sup>1: While uncommon, it is possible to have magic items that grant
      luck, insight, profane, or sacred bonuses to AC or saving throws, morale
      bonuses to saving throws, or other bonuses. When applying such benefits
      through a charm, morale bonuses have Mind as a base sphere, insight
      bonuses have Divination as a base sphere, and luck, profane, and sacred
      bonuses have Fate as a base sphere.</sup></p>
