      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Brain Consumption.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you consume a creature&#8217;s brain
      using the Brain Consumption feat, choose one combat talent or magic talent
      that the creature whose brain you consumed possessed. Once per day as a
      free action, you may gain that talent for a number of minutes equal to
      your character level. Upon consuming a creature&#8217;s brain, you learn
      of all talents that they possessed but must meet the prerequisites for a
      talent in order to select it. You still may only benefit from having one
      brain eaten at a time and may not exchange talents more than once every 24
      hours. When you consume a new brain, you can no longer access talents from
      previous brains you have consumed.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat an additional time for
      every 5 character levels you possess. Each time, you may select an
      additional talent which was known by the creature whose brain you ate.
      When you activate the temporary bonus talent from this feat, you gain the
      benefits of one talent for every time you have taken this feat.</p>
