      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere (Monstrous Attacks
      (form) with poison option).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any creature that confirms a critical hit
      against your companion with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed
      with its poison (treat the poison as a contact poison for this
      application). Melee weapons with reach do not endanger their users in this
      way.</p>

      <p>Additionally, your companion can apply its poison to a weapon or
      natural attack by dipping it in its own blood as a swift action. This
      requires dealing 1d4 damage to itself as part of the swift action unless
      the companion suffers from an ongoing bleed effect or is below half its
      maximum hit points.</p>
