      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere (Manipulate Aura
      (sensory, magic)); Illusion sphere (Shadow Infusion) or shadow pool;
      Shadow Magic or create reality class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the Shadow Magic feat or create
      reality class feature to duplicate effects from another sphere, you may
      spend a shadow point to treat the effect as both from the Illusion sphere
      and the sphere it is mimicking. This allows you to apply bonuses from
      items, class features, talents or feats that benefit that sphere as well
      as the Illusion sphere.</p>

      <p>This feat does not allow you to apply the caster level bonus from
      staves for two different spheres. For example, when using create reality
      or Shadow Magic to produce a destructive blast, you may apply Destruction
      talents you possess and apply the caster level bonus from either a staff
      of Destruction or Illusion, apply bonus damage from elementalist energy
      specialization class feature and treat both your fey adept and
      elementalist levels as full caster levels for calculating the caster
      level.</p>
