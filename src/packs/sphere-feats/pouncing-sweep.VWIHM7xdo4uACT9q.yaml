      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Open Hand sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Whenever you use the sweep ability of the
      Open Hand sphere, you may move 5 feet immediately before performing the
      trip using any movement mode associated with Athletics sphere packages you
      possess. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. At +6
      base attack bonus and every 5 base attack bonus higher, you may add up to
      +5 feet of movement to the sweep.</p>
