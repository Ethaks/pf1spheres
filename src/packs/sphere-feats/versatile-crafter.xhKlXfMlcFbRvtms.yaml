      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Any item creation feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When creating a magic item, you may create an
      item even if you lack the base sphere or do not have a high enough caster
      level or MSB. This increases the DC of the item creation check by +5 for
      each base sphere or individual caster level/point of MSB bypassed in this
      fashion.</p>

      <p><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Versatile Crafter is on this page because
      it is about creating magic items. However, it is not a true item creation
      feat, and does not count as such for any purpose. This feat does not allow
      you to bypass talent prerequisites for creating compounds, spell
      completion items, or spell trigger items.</p>
