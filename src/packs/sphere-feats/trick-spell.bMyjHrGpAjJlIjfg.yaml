      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Only Mind talents (or talents that also
      include an effect from the Mind sphere, such as some spellcrafted or dual
      sphere effects) that affect a single target and can be negated with a
      successful Will save can be trick talents. If the target fails its Will
      save against a trick talent, in addition to the talent&#8217;s normal
      effects, the target also clumsily hinders itself. Immediately attempt a
      special combat maneuver check (1d20 + your caster level + your Charisma
      bonus) to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver against the target. Any
      feats you have that apply to dirty trick maneuvers (such as Greater Dirty
      Trick) also apply to this check. This combat maneuver check never provokes
      attacks of opportunity.</p>
