    value: >
      <p>The lower planes have methods and loopholes which you can exploit.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Ability to call or bind extraplanar
      creatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You are capable of bargaining with evil
      outsiders more effectively.</p>

      <p><strong>One Damnation Feat:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus to opposed
      Charisma checks against called creatures when using the Call Planar
      Creature advanced talent. This bonus also applies to your Conjuration DC
      for the purpose of controlling Unwilling Companions.</p>

      <p><strong>Two Damnation Feats:</strong> When using Call Planar Creature
      to summon an evil outsider as an ally, you can attempt an opposed Charisma
      check against a called fiend. If you succeed, the fiend reduces the price
      it demands to serve you by half.</p>

      <p><strong>Three Damnation Feats:</strong> The bonus to opposed Charisma
      checks and Conjuration DC improves from +2 to +4.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Damnation Feats:</strong> When you use Call Planar
      Creature to call an evil outsider whose name you know, the casting time is
      reduced from 10 minutes to 1 minute. You may spend two extra spell points
      when summoning a Companion to summon them as a swift action.</p>
