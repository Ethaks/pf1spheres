      <p>You enlarge the area of your despoilation to amplify its effects.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Terrain Casting drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you blight, corrupt, or drain an
      area of its nutrients with the Terrain Casting drawback, you may extend
      the radius of area corrupted by 5 feet + 5 feet for every 5 caster levels
      you possess. If you do, increase the DC of the blighting effect by 1. If
      you possess any feats that force saving throws from creatures in the
      blighted area (such as Agonizing Defiling), you increase their DC by the
      same amount.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Defiler Feats:</strong> The DC is increased by 2 rather
      than 1.</p>
