      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can modify a talent to deafen a creature
      damaged by the talent. When a creature takes damage from this talent, it
      becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the caster level of
      the spell (minimum 1 round). If the talent allows a saving throw, a
      successful save negates the deafening effect. If the talent does not allow
      a save, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the deafening
      effect. If the talent effect also causes the creature to become deafened,
      the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the
      talent. Talents that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this
      metamagic.</p>
