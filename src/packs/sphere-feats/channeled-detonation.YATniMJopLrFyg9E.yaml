      <p>You can overcharge your connection with your undead using your channel
      energy ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, ability to channel
      negative energy, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can spend a use of your channel energy
      ability as a standard action to detonate a mindless undead you control
      within 30 feet, destroying it, but causing your channel energy to burst
      outwards from its location; your channel deals (or heals, as appropriate)
      1 additional point of damage per Hit Die of the undead sacrificed. You can
      activate this ability as an immediate action whenever a mindless undead
      you control within 30 feet is reduced to 0 hit points by spending a spell
      point (and a use of channel energy, as normal).</p>

      <p>If you possess the Master&#8217;s Presence (dominion) talent, you may
      use your dominion range when determining if an undead you control is
      within range for this feat.</p>
