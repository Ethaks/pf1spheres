      "value": "<p>Your powers are long known with stories untold. You have unlocked more of your latent bloodline&#8217;s potentials, harnessing the might of those who stood before you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere (Atavism (adrenaline)), base attack bonus +3.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While benefiting from the Atavism (adrenaline) talent, you gain two additional abilities associated with your heritage you are benefiting from (see Table: Improved Atavism). Abilities granted by this feat are individually noted to be exceptional (Ex) or supernatural (Su).</p>\n<p>Calculate the effects of abilities granted by this feat with your effective Berserker sphere base attack bonus (including adjustments from effects like a conscript&#8217;s sphere specialization or the Combat Sphere Specialization feat). If an ability granted by this feat would require a saving throw, the DC is equal to your Berserker sphere DC (10 + 1/2 base attack bonus + practitioner modifier).</p>\n<strong>Table: Improved Atavism</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Heritage Creature Type</th>\n<th>Heritage Ability 1</th>\n<th>Heritage Ability 2</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Aberration</th>\n<td><strong>Beyond Understanding (Su):</strong> Whenever another creature uses an ability to gain information about you (such as a Knowledge check, the Scout sphere scout ability, Divination sphere divine sphere effect, detect alignment or discern lies spell, or other similar effect), that creature must succeed at a Will save or the ability&#8217;s target changes to another creature within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per base attack bonus), chosen at random. The creature is not aware their ability targeted another creature but may make inferences based on the results (such as being told a human has weaknesses similar to a clockwork robot in the room). Abilities which would bypass a misdirection spell or similar effect also bypass this ability.<br>\n<br>\nYou are aware of creatures who have failed their saving throw against this effect, and for the next 24 hours you gain an insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures who have failed their saving throw against this effect equal to +1 + 1 per 5 base attack bonus.</td>\n<td><strong>Slip Between The Fabric (Su):</strong> Whenever you successfully make an attack action or attack of opportunity against a creature, you may teleport 5 feet into an unoccupied space. You must have line of sight to that space to teleport into it. For every 10 base attack bonus you possess, increase the distance you can teleport with this effect by +5 feet. Teleporting more than 5 feet with this effect is taxing and may only be done a number of times each round equal to 1/2 your practitioner modifier (minimum 1).<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, whenever you take a 5-foot step, you may instead teleport 5 feet. This allows you to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Animal</th>\n<td><strong>Instincts (Ex):</strong> If you would be caught flat-footed or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC for any reason, you may expend your martial focus as an immediate action. If you do, you cannot be caught flat-footed or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC for any reason until the start of your next turn. This can allow you to remove the penalties from being feinted in combat and may be used in response to an attack roll or effect targeting you while you would be flat-footed or be denied your Dexterity bonus to AC. If you possess uncanny dodge, such as the rogue class feature, you do not need to expend your martial focus to use this ability.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mythic Note:</strong> If an effect from a mythic source would cause you to become flat-footed or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC, you do not negate that effect unless you are also mythic.</td>\n<td><strong>Feral Offense (Ex):</strong> Once per round you may declare an attack to be either a precise or feral attack. You must use this ability before the attack roll is made.<br>\n<br>\nIf you choose to make a precise attack, you may roll twice on your attack roll, taking the better result.<br>\n<br>\nIf you choose to make a feral attack, your attack gains one of the following:<br>\n* <strong>Fell:</strong> Your attack gains the trip universal monster ability, allowing you to trip as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity if you successfully hit with the attack.<br>\n* <strong>Howl:</strong> If you successfully hit with the attack, you may attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of your attack as a free action.<br>\n* <strong>Tear:</strong> Your attack deals an additional amount of bleed damage equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Construct</th>\n<td><strong>Golem Blood (Su):</strong> You gain a morale bonus on saving throws made to resist magical effects (e.g. spells, supernatural abilities, spell-like abilities) equal to +1 + 1 per 6 base attack bonus. You gain this bonus even if you could not normally benefit from a morale bonus (such as having immunity to mind-affecting effects). You cannot be a willing target of any spell or magic sphere effect and must attempt saving throws to resist all spells or magic sphere effects, even those cast by your allies, except your own.</td>\n<td><strong>Overclock (Ex):</strong> You may expend your martial focus as a free action to overclock your body for 2 rounds + 1 round per 10 base attack bonus. While overclocked you gain the following benefits:<br>\n* +10 feet bonus to all modes of movement you possess + 5 per 5 base attack bonus.<br>\n* Your weapon attacks deal an additional 1d4 damage + 1d4 per 5 base attack bonus that is half electricity and half fire damage.<br>\n* Whenever you make a successful attack action, you may make one extra attack as a swift action.<br>\n<br>\nWhile you are overclocked, you must use your berserking ability with the Atavism (adrenaline) for your construct heritage each round otherwise overclock&#8217;s duration immediately ends. If you overclock while benefiting from this effect, the duration stacks.<br>\n<br>\nWhen overclock&#8217;s duration ends, you are fatigued for 1 minute for each round you were overclocked, or exhausted for 1 hour if you are already fatigued by this effect. Fatigue and exhaustion from this ability bypass any immunity you may possess.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Dragon</th>\n<td><strong>Draconic Heir (Su):</strong> Choose a single dragon type (see the sorcerer&#8217;s draconic bloodline for examples, Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook). Once chosen, this cannot be changed.<br>\n<br>\nYou gain energy resistance equal to your base attack bonus against your dragon&#8217;s energy type which stacks with all other forms of energy resistance you possess. If you select a dragon aligned with a physical damage type (e.g. an etheric esoteric dragon with bludgeoning damage), you instead gain damage reduction against that damage type equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1) which stacks with all other forms of damage reduction you possess.</td>\n<td><strong>Dragon&#8217;s Fury (Su):</strong> Whenever you successfully make an attack action, you may unleash your draconic power to create a 15-foot cone-shaped burst of energy. The cone originates from the struck target; the cone&#8217;s base includes the struck target&#8217;s square. Creatures in the cone&#8217;s area of effect take energy damage equal to 1d6 + your base attack bonus (Reflex half). The energy damage dealt is the same as your dragon&#8217;s energy type chosen for the draconic heir ability. You must wait at least 1d4 rounds between uses of this ability but may expend martial focus as a free action to ready this ability immediately.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Fey</th>\n<td><strong>Fey Trickster (Ex):</strong> You reduce the action required to feint a creature by 1 step (standard to move, move to swift; minimum swift action). This reduction stacks with the Improved Feint feat, Fencing sphere Fast Feint talent, or other similar effects which reduce the action required to feint.<br>\n<br>\nWhenever you successfully feint a creature, that creature is &#8220;bewildered&#8221; for 1d4 rounds. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for moving through a bewildered creature&#8217;s threatened area. If you would perform an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity, you may expend your martial focus as a free action that can be taken even when it is not your turn. If you do, that action does not provoke an attack of opportunity from any bewildered creatures (but otherwise provokes normally).<br>\n<br>\nThe bewildered condition can be removed by any ability or effect which could remove the battered condition.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Abilities which grant you the ability to feint as part of another action (Dual Wielding sphere Cunning Combo) or through a specific ability (Illusion sphere Mage Feint) do not have their action required reduced by this ability.</td>\n<td><strong>Fairy Dust Strike (Su):</strong> Whenever you successfully make an attack action against a creature, you gain concealment (20% miss chance) against that creature until the end of your next turn. The miss chance from this concealment increases by 5% for every 3 points of base attack bonus you possess; at 50% miss chance or higher, this is treated as total concealment. This concealment is an illusion effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Humanoid</th>\n<td><strong>Aura of Kings (Su):</strong> You gain a 30-foot aura. Once per round, if another ally inside this aura would roll a saving throw, you may allow that ally to use your saving throw bonus instead. You must use this ability before the roll is made.</td>\n<td><strong>Lead The Way (Ex):</strong> Whenever you successfully make an attack action against a creature, that creature is marked until the end of your next turn. You and your allies gain a circumstance bonus on attack rolls against creatures marked with this ability equal to +1 + 1 per 10 base attack bonus.<br>\n<br>\nAlternatively, you may spend a standard action to mark one creature you can see. The bonuses against a target marked this way increase by +1.<br>\n<br>\nWhenever an ally attacks a creature marked by this ability, you may expend your martial focus as an immediate action to allow that ally to roll twice on their attack roll, taking the better result. You must use this ability before the first attack roll is made.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Magical Beast</th>\n<td><strong>Creature of Myth (Su):</strong> You add 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1) to the DC of any skill check made against you (such as to Intimidate you, feint you in combat, use the Scout sphere scout ability against you).<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, you gain an insight bonus equal to 1/4 your base attack bonus (minimum 1) on opposed skill checks you attempt (such as your Stealth check to hide opposed by other creatures&#8217; Perception). You do not gain this bonus on opposed skill checks made to foil another creature&#8217;s check (such as your Perception check made to foil an opponent&#8217;s Stealth check).</td>\n<td><strong>Rending Fang (Ex):</strong> You gain a unique rending attack which may only be used as part of this ability. This rending attack deals damage using one natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon you wield plus 1-1/2 times your practitioner modifier (replacing your Strength modifier or other ability score used when dealing damage with this weapon). You may make this rending attack with a ranged weapon.<br>\n<br>\nOnce per round, whenever you confirm a critical hit or a creature fails a saving throw against a combat sphere effect used as part of an attack action made with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon (such as the Berserker sphere Heavy Swing (exertion), Dual Wielding sphere Dizzying Combination, etc.), you may use your rending attack against that creature as a free action that can be taken even when it is not your turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Monstrous Humanoid</th>\n<td><strong>Superiority (Su):</strong> You gain an insight bonus on saving throws made to resist any effect originating from a creature that does not possess your base creature type equal to +1 + 1 per 7 base attack bonus (e.g. resisting an extraordinary effect from a construct, where your base creature type is humanoid).</td>\n<td><strong>Monstrous Power (Ex):</strong> Damage you deal ignores an amount of damage reduction, energy resistance, or hardness the target possesses equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1).<br>\n<br>\nYou may expend your martial focus as a free action to briefly surge with strength, gaining a size bonus to your Strength and Dexterity for 1 round equal to +2 + 2 per 5 base attack bonus. You may only use this ability once every 1d4 + 1 rounds.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Ooze</th>\n<td><strong>Adaptive Absorption (Su):</strong> After you take hit point damage of any kind, you gain damage reduction (DR/adamantine) or energy resistance equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1) against that type of damage until the end of your next turn. This stacks with any other damage reduction or energy resistance you may possess.<br>\n<br>\nThis ability can provide damage reduction or energy resistance against unusual damage types (such as force, negative, or untyped energy damage). For the purposes of this ability, damage reduction and energy resistance are both referred to as &#8220;absorption&#8221;. Physical attacks which deal multiple damage types simultaneously (such as a bite natural attack) bypass the damage reduction granted by this ability if you do not possess damage reduction against each damage type dealt by the attack.<br>\n<br>\nYou may maintain up to 2 types of absorption + 1 absorption for every 10 base attack bonus you possess. If you would gain a new absorption while already maintaining the maximum number of absorptions, you may choose one absorption to replace, or choose to not gain the new absorption.<br>\n<br>\nIf an attack deals multiple damage types, choose only one type of damage to gain absorption against. For example, if you take damage from an attack dealing piercing, slashing, and fire damage, you choose only one of those damage types to gain absorption against.<br>\n<br>\nIf you use your berserking ability with the Atavism (adrenaline) for your ooze heritage, you retain each absorption you have gained from this ability for an additional round.</td>\n<td><strong>Oozemolded Armaments (Su):</strong> Any weapon you wield gains the greater transformative special ability. You may activate this greater transformative special ability once per round a free action while using your berserking ability with the Atavism (adrenaline) for your ooze heritage. Any round you are not using the Atavism (adrenaline) for your ooze heritage, any weapons transformed with this ability return to their normal form. Natural attacks, unarmed strikes, and ammunition (such as shuriken) cannot be transformed into other weapon types, and you cannot transform weapons into natural attacks, unarmed strikes, or ammunition.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, you can treat any weapon transformed by this ability as though it were still the original weapon for any feats, effects, or abilities you have that specifically apply to that type of weapon (such as Weapon Focus, fighter&#8217;s weapon training, warpriest&#8217;s sacred weapon, or faithful shepherd cleric&#8217;s divine guidance divine work). For example, a battleaxe transformed into a spear would still be treated as a battleaxe for the Weapon Focus feat, weapon training for axes, or as your deity&#8217;s favored weapon despite being a different type of weapon, in addition to being treated as a spear and having the properties of a spear. Feats, effects and abilities cannot apply to a transformed weapon more than once (possessing Weapon Focus for the base weapon and the new form would not grant benefits twice). You cannot use abilities that require a specific type of weapon if the transformed weapon&#8217;s current form does not support it.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Outsider</th>\n<td><strong>Planar Heritor (Su):</strong> Choose a single outsider subtype or specific outsider (subject to GM discretion). Once chosen, this cannot be changed. From your chosen outsider subtype, select a number of defensive abilities your outsider type possesses equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1). If you could choose more options than your outsider subtype possesses, you may choose additional options your outsider type does not possess (subject to GM discretion). These selections are made when you first gain this feat and may be changed after 8 hours of rest.<br>\n<br>\nYou do not gain the selected defensive abilities. Instead, whenever you attempt a saving throw against an effect with a descriptor that would be mitigated, resisted, or ignored by a selected defensive ability, you may roll twice, taking the better result.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Defensive abilities include resistance, immunity, and saving throw bonuses (ex. acid resistance, petrification immunity, +2 vs. poison). If a defensive ability grants benefits against a creature type, alignment, or other open ended effect, you do not gain any benefits against that effect unless it is a descriptor or condition. For example, choosing &#8220;evil&#8221; would allow you to roll twice against effects with the evil descriptor, not any effect from an evil source.</td>\n<td><strong>Planar Pressure (Su):</strong> Any damage you deal is treated as being aligned damage for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction, regeneration, and other abilities. These alignment types are determined by the chosen outsider&#8217;s alignments for the planar heritor ability (ex. a chosen outsider being a devil would grant evil and lawful). If the outsider chosen for the planar heritor ability is true neutral, you may expend your martial focus as a free action to choose a single alignment for this ability for a number of rounds equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1).<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, opponents treat each square within 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 base attack bonus of you as difficult terrain.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Plant</th>\n<td><strong>Blossoming Barrier (Su):</strong> Whenever you take hit point damage, reduce the amount of damage taken by the number of blossoms you have. Then, if you are still damaged by the effect, you gain 1 blossom for every 3 base attack bonus you possess. You may only have a number of blossoms equal to 3 + 1/2 your base attack bonus at any time, and you lose all blossoms at the start of your turn. Unlike damage reduction, damage prevented by this ability cannot be bypassed.</td>\n<td><strong>Punishing Brambles (Su):</strong> Whenever you successfully make an attack action, the target is entangled for 1 round + 1 round for every 3 base attack bonus you possess (Reflex negates). If a target entangled by this ability fails their saving throw against this ability again, the entangled condition&#8217;s duration stacks. A target entangled by this ability can attempt to remove the entangled condition as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity by attempting a Reflex saving throw, Escape Artist check, or Strength ability check with a DC equal to this ability&#8217;s DC. Alternatively, the entangling mass of brambles and vines can be cut away as a standard action, or as a move action by another creature.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, after a target entangled by this ability makes an attack roll or casts a non-harmless spell that targets you or includes you in its effect, the target takes piercing damage equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1) and must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or fall prone. A target that successfully avoids falling prone cannot be knocked prone by this ability until the start of their next turn.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Undead</th>\n<td><strong>Thief Of Life (Su):</strong> You are healed by both positive and negative energy effects if they could heal a living or undead creature. You take damage from positive or negative energy effects normally if it could not heal a living or undead creature (such as a cleric&#8217;s channel negative energy to harm or a Destruction sphere Nether Blast dealing negative energy damage).<br>\n<br>\nWhenever an opponent within 30 feet of you receives any amount of healing (except fast healing or regeneration), you also heal an amount equal to half the healing received unless that opponent succeeds at a Will saving throw. If multiple opponents would be healed simultaneously by the same effect, you only receive healing once from this ability even if multiple opponents fail their saving throw.</td>\n<td><strong>Lash Of The Pale Court (Su):</strong> Whenever you successfully make an attack action against a creature, that creature is marked with a necrotic scar. Necrotic scars last until the end of your next turn; whenever you mark a creature with a necrotic scar, refresh the duration of each active necrotic scar. A creature with a necrotic scar is referred to as a &#8220;scarred creature&#8221; by this ability. Necrotic scars from different sources are tracked separately. Abilities and effects which refer to scarred creatures or necrotic scars are limited to necrotic scars you have created, not necrotic scars from any source.<br>\n<br>\nScarred creatures suffer negative energy damage equal to your practitioner modifier at the start of their turn (to a maximum of your base attack bonus). If a scarred creature possesses necrotic scars from multiple sources, they only suffer this damage once.<br>\n<br>\nYou may expend your martial focus as an immediate action to end any number of active necrotic scars, causing each scarred creature to take negative energy damage equal to 1d6 + 1d6 per 5 base attack bonus (Fortitude half). For each necrotic scar ended this way, the saving throw DC increases by +1.<br>\n<br>\nIf a scarred creature would be marked by you an additional time, you may target 1 unmarked creature + 1 additional unmarked creature per 10 base attack bonus within close range of the creature (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 base attack bonus), marking them with a necrotic scar until the end of your next turn.<br>\n<br>\nNegative energy damage from this ability cannot heal undead creatures.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Vermin</th>\n<td><strong>Vermin Heart (Ex):</strong> You gain a natural armor bonus that stacks with other sources of natural armor equal to +1 + 1 per 5 base attack bonus. In addition, you reduce any damage taken from a swarm by 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1). Whenever you would attempt a saving throw against a swarm&#8217;s abilities, you roll twice and take the better result.</td>\n<td><strong>Swarmblade (Ex):</strong> Your weapon attacks deal full damage to swarms, regardless of the swarm&#8217;s immunity to weapon damage (if any; damage reduction applies as normal).<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, whenever you successfully make an attack action against a non-swarm creature, that creature gains infested wounds (Fortitude negates). Whenever a creature with infested wounds attempts to take a standard or full-round action, they suffer untyped damage equal to your practitioner modifier + 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1). This counts as taking damage when casting a spell for the purpose of concentration checks. This is treated as a swarm&#8217;s distraction ability for the purposes of immunities. Creatures immune to effects which require a Fortitude save are not immune to this ability, but instead gain a +4 bonus on their saving throw to resist the effects (such as constructs and undead).<br>\n<br>\nA creature with infested wounds can end this effect by either receiving healing greater than or equal to the infesting attack&#8217;s damage or by spending a move action. The effects of infested wounds do not stack; if a creature would gain infested wounds more than once, use the strongest instance of infested wounds to determine how much healing is required to remove the effect and how much damage is inflicted.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
