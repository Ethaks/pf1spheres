      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Circle Casting,
      Spell Proxy, any one teamwork feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may treat any creature under the effects
      of Create Proxy as if they shared all of your teamwork feats. They do not
      gain the benefits of your teamwork feats unless they actually have it
      themselves.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you also have Improved Spell Proxy, you
      may choose to grant them the benefits of one of your teamwork feats
      instead of transferring concentration.</p>
