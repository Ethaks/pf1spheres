      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (one or more (sense)
      talents or abilities).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain a resistance bonus to saves equal to
      the number of senses from the Divination sphere you have active (maximum 1
      + 1 per 4 Hit Dice). In addition, you may as an immediate action spend a
      spell point and dismiss a sense you have active to reroll a saving throw
      you have failed.</p>
