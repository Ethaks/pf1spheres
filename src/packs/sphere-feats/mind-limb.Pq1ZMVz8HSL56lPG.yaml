      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Telekinesis sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your telekinetic powers give you an
      additional arm made of telekinetic force. Your telekinetic limb functions
      much as a normal arm can, but to an extent can also act independently.</p>

      <p>As a swift action you can use it to draw a sheathed or hidden weapon,
      ready a shield, retrieve a stored item, load a crossbow, open a door, pick
      up an unattended item, sheathe or store an item, or take other
      non-offensive actions involving manipulating objects. Your telekinetic
      limb cannot effectively wield weapons or shields or activate magic items,
      but can pass such items to another hand as part of any other action it
      takes.</p>
