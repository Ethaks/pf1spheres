      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Warp sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You allow a magic effect to function even
      without line of effect, transporting its effects through barriers that
      would otherwise impede it. You must still possess line of sight for
      effects that require it, and the target must still be within the
      effect&#8217;s range.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +3 spell points.</p>
