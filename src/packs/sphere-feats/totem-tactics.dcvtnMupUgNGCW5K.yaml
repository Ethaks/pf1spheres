      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> War sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Allies inside any of your totems or sharing a
      mandate with you are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats
      as you for the purpose of determining whether you receive a bonus from
      those feats. Your allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats
      unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies&#8217;
      positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the
      teamwork feat for you to receive the listed bonus.</p>
