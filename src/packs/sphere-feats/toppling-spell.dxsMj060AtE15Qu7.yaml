    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The impact of your force talent is strong
      enough to knock the target prone. If the target takes damage, fails its
      saving throw, or is moved by your force talent, make a trip check against
      the target, using your caster level plus your casting ability modifier.
      This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the check fails, the
      target cannot attempt to trip you or the force effect in response. This
      metamagic only affects talents with the force descriptor.</p>
