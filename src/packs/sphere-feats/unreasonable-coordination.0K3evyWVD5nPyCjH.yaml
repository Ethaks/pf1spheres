      <p>Those extra arms are not just for display. A little practice and
      dedication and you can get them all moving independently.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Three or more arms, base attack bonus
      +6, Dexterity 13, Two-Weapon Fighting.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When two-weapon fighting, you may treat an
      additional hand as an off-hand, allowing you to make an additional
      off-hand attack with that hand whenever you make a usual off-hand
      attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat a number of times
      equal to the number of arms you possess beyond two. A tatulani must
      possess the Strengthened Arms feat to gain this feat.</p>
