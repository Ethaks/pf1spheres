      <p>Your form is molded by the dark powers which you serve.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your features change to become more inhuman
      and powerful.</p>

      <p><strong>One Damnation Feat:</strong> You gain either a pair of claws
      which deal 1d4 damage (1d3 if Small) or a bite or gore attack which deals
      1d6 damage (1d4 if Small). These are considered primary natural
      attacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Two Damnation Feats:</strong> You may gain a natural attack
      that you did not select for your first Damnation feat or may gain a
      prehensile tail (as the tiefling racial trait). You count as a tiefling
      for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>

      <p><strong>Three Damnation Feats:</strong> All of your natural and weapon
      attacks count as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If
      you are also lawful or chaotic, your attacks count as the corresponding
      alignment as well.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Damnation Feats:</strong> You gain either wings (which
      grant you a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (which
      grant the ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or DR
      5/silver or cold iron (chosen when you take this option) which improves to
      DR 5/good, chaotic, or lawful (chosen when you gain this improvement) at
      10th level.</p>
