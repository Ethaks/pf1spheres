      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Stealth 6 ranks.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Creatures using unusual forms of sensory
      perception such as blindsight, greensight, or tremorsense cannot
      automatically foil your use of Stealth; such creatures must attempt a
      Perception check as normal to detect you when you make use of the Stealth
      skill, though they gain a +2 bonus for each unusual form of perception you
      must try to avoid beyond the first. Lurker In Darkness foils indirect
      detection (such as a creature using detect magic to search for your
      magical items while you are using Stealth) in the manner described above,
      but has no effect on psi-like abilities, powers, spells, spell-like
      abilities, and/or supernatural abilities specifically used to uncover
      information about you rather than enhancing the user&#8217;s perception,
      such as the augury spell. However, when interacting with sphere talents
      and abilities, Lurker In Darkness foils Divination sphere sense abilities
      in the manner described above, but has no effect on the Divination sphere
      divine abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This feat was previously published in the
      Psionic Bestiary, by Dreamscarred Press. It has been modified to work with
      Spheres of Power.</p>
