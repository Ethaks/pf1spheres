      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere (Directional Control
      drawback).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may use telekinesis to move objects both
      directly towards you and directly away from you. If you push or pull an
      object that does not move (for example, a building or the ground/an object
      pushed into the ground) you may instead apply the movement to yourself,
      using the stalled momentum of your telekinesis to push or pull yourself in
      the opposite direction. This means that, as a standard action, you can
      move yourself at a speed equal to double your telekinesis speed but only
      towards or away from a stationary object that you can affect with
      telekinesis (if you end in the air, you do not fall until the end of your
      next turn). You may grant yourself this ability as a sustained force,
      gaining a fly speed equal to twice your telekinesis speed, but may only
      move in a single direction per move action that is toward or away from an
      appropriate object for telekinesis.</p>
