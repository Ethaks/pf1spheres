      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> War sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have a squadron of allies who experience
      greater benefits from your totems. Your squadron can include yourself and
      up to 3 additional allies, plus an additional ally for every 5 caster
      levels you possess or for every 5 ranks in Diplomacy you possess,
      whichever is higher. You can change the membership any time you rest and
      regain spell points, but you must touch a creature to add it to your
      squadron. You must spend 1 minute every day renewing the links between you
      and your squad members. You must have access to each member you wish to
      include. Your caster level at the time you renew this connection is used
      for this ability through the day, even if your caster level changes.</p>

      <p>Squadron members must be specific individuals. Squadrons can include
      summoned companions that are effectively the same creature being summoned
      each time (such as the companion summoned with the Conjuration sphere),
      but not spontaneously created creatures.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, instead of allies, your squadron may consist of yourself
      and one crew or troop.</p>

      <p>Members of your squadron gain increased bonuses from your totems. If a
      totem grants a bonus to any d20 roll or any number that is the target of a
      d20 roll (such as AC, attack rolls, saving throws, CMB, CMD, ability
      checks, skill checks, concentration checks, or spell penetration checks),
      that bonus increases by +1, and an additional +1 for every 10 War caster
      levels you possess.</p>
