      <p>Your magic overtakes your body, blessing you with an advanced
      physiology as you sink deeper into depravity.</p>

      Unsettling Casting drawback, Witchwarped, magic skill bonus 5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Select one additional trait that you could
      select with the Witchwarped feat. While you possess a lesser madness or a
      moderate addiction as a result of a casting drawback, you gain the
      benefits of this trait in addition to the trait granted from
      Witchwarped.</p>

      <p>When your magic skill bonus reaches 10, you may select a third trait
      which you gain while you possess a greater madness or severe addiction</p>
