      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The electricity, fire, or light effects of
      the affected talent create a flaring light that dazzles creatures that
      take damage from the talent. A flaring talent causes a creature that takes
      fire or electricity damage from the affected talent to become dazzled for
      a number of rounds equal 1/2 the caster level of the spell (minimum 1
      round). A flaring metamagic effect only affects talents with a fire,
      light, or electricity descriptor that deal damage.</p>
