      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This effect only works on mind-affecting
      talents. A threnodic talents affects undead creatures (even mindless
      undead) as if they were not immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no
      effect on living creatures. This metamagic does not give you the effects
      of the Mind sphere&#8217;s Expanded Charm talent.</p>
