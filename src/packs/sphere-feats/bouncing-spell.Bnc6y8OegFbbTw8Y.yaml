      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever a bouncing talent targeting a single
      creature has no effect on its intended target (whether due to spell
      resistance or a successful saving throw) you may, as a swift action,
      redirect it to target another eligible creature within range. The
      redirected talent behaves in all ways as if its new target were the
      original target for the talent. Talents that affect a target in any way
      (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) may not be
      redirected in this manner.</p>
