      <p>Using your miraculous ability to create a static point between
      dimensions, you can temporarily bend gravity to swing yourself upward.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fey type or subtype, planar balancer
      racial trait.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a swift action, you may expend a round of
      your planar balancer racial ability to make an Acrobatics check to jump,
      moving a number of feet equal to your check in any direction with a top
      height equal to 1/4 your check as normal. This is in addition to other
      movement taken during the round, and provokes attacks of opportunity as
      normal. This jump may be taken in the middle of a standard jump,
      increasing the height and distance of that jump, as well as allowing you
      to change direction in mid-air (in essence, allowing you to
      &#8216;jump&#8217; in the middle of a jump).</p>
