      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Energy Tether (blast shape)).</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the Energy Tether blast shape, instead of targeting a creature, you can anchor it to a solid surface within its range such as a wall or ceiling (but not floor) as a standard action. This can only work to a maximum range of close, whatever your destructive blast&#8217;s maximum range. Once the tether is anchored, you may, as a move action, attempt to move to any other legal square within the tether&#8217;s reach (as determined from the anchor point) without provoking an attack of opportunity, regardless of your normal move speed, by attempting an Acrobatics check and comparing the result to the CMD of each creature adjacent to the start and destination points; success on this check allows you to complete the movement, and failure causes you to fall prone in a square adjacent to the creature whose CMD you failed to beat. This movement can include squares on elevated or recessed surfaces, or even walls. If you have a climb speed, you may even end this movement on a wall or ceiling. You must have a clear path towards the destination (this ability does not allow you to pass through solid obstacles or opponents, though it may allow you to circumvent an enemy if you have a clear path around them within the tether&#8217;s reach).</p>\n<p>You must have a free hand to use this ability. Blast types that carry a spell point cost do not incur that cost when using this feat. The anchoring object receives no damage nor other effects of your destructive blast.</p>\n",
