      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Diagram Magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may imbue your diagrams with magic that triggers on a later time.</p>\n<p>You can imbue a diagram with a magic sphere effect by spending a spell point (in addition to any spell point costs of the sphere effect itself).</p>\n<p>The imbuement effect lasts for 1 hour per magic skill bonus or until activated by a trigger specified by the caster at the time it is created (a diagram can only have one trigger). A diagram is considered as intelligent as its caster in relation to detecting and following its triggers, and can see and hear as well as a humanoid could with regular senses and a bonus to Perception equal to your magic skill bonus. The trigger can be one of many things, but the diagram runs the risk of being deceived if the trigger is too complicated. A diagram knows when it has been read, and this information may be used as part of a trigger.</p>\n<p>If the spell effect has a target, the diagram must be large enough to encompass all of the targets&#8217; area before triggering. When activated, the diagram becomes the center point for the effect, and it performs its function, and then the ability ends. A diagram can only hold one magic sphere effect and a creature can only be affected by 1 imbued effect in a round, regardless of the number of diagrams triggered. You can create a hidden imbued diagram by spending an additional full-round action to hide it for every 5 feet it occupies.</p>\n<p>A hidden diagram can be seen by effects that detect or sense magic, and is detectable as a magical trap. In order for someone to spot one of your hidden diagrams it requires a Perception Check with a DC equal to 25 + 1/2 your magic skill bonus (minimum 1). Disabling the diagram simply requires disrupting it.</p>\n",
