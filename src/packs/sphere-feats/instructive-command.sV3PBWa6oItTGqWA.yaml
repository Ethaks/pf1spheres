      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Squadron Commander; or
      Warleader sphere, Troop Commander.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a skill you are trained in. All
      members of your squadron are treated as having at least as many ranks in
      that skill as you. If you possess the skill unlock for that skill, members
      of your squadron may use the skill unlock powers made available by your
      number of ranks in the skill. Whenever you rest for 8 hours, you may
      change the skill you have chosen to share.</p>
