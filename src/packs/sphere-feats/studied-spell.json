      "value": "<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When casting a studied talent, designate one target affected by the spell. Attempt an appropriate Knowledge check based on that target&#8217;s creature type as you cast the talent. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the creature&#8217;s CR based on its race and not including any class levels or templates (a creature that is defined by class levels has an effective CR of 0 for this ability). If you succeed, your studied talent ignores any energy resistance or damage reduction the target has because of its race as well as any bonuses on saving throws against the talent granted by the target&#8217;s race (such as the bonus from a dwarf&#8217;s hardy ability or a halfling&#8217;s halfling luck ability). Your studied talent does not ignore energy resistance, damage reduction, or saving throw bonuses granted by other talents and effects. If you fail the Knowledge check, the talent still has its normal effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>\n",
