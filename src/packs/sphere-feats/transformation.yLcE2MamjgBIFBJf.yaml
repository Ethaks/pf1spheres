      <p><em>Errata:</em> The Transformation feat (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg.
      487) has received an errata, clarifying some interactions and allowing the
      feat to be taken more than once.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one (transformation) Alteration sphere
      talent that does not cost a spell point. If you choose Anthropomorphic
      Transformation and are humanoid or of a similar makeup, choose another
      (transformation) or (body) talent to choose traits from for
      Anthropomorphic Transformation&#8217;s effects.</p>

      <p>As a full-round action, you may assume the form of a single creature
      whose type corresponds to the chosen (transformation) talent. This
      functions as the Alteration sphere shapeshift sphere effect as a
      supernatural ability. The same form and appearance is mimicked each time
      you assume this form (e.g. the same wolf, spider, treant, etc.). The
      chosen form may be the same as your base size or Medium or Small, applying
      size change bonuses and penalties as appropriate if your size would
      change. This transformation lasts until you choose to revert to your
      original form as a full-round action.</p>

      <p>While in your chosen form, you gain all the abilities granted by your
      chosen form (movement modes, natural attacks, special abilities, etc.) but
      do not gain any additional traits from this shapeshift effect. Treat your
      Hit Dice as your caster level for the purposes of this effect. If an
      Alteration sphere effect from your chosen form would use your casting
      ability modifier (and you do not have one), you use your Charisma modifier
      to determine the effects (such as the save DC of a trait). This is a
      polymorph effect.</p>

      <p>You gain the shapechanger subtype.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may gain traits from the Alteration
      sphere Blank Transformation while under the effects of this feat, even
      though it is a polymorph effect. This feat counts as possessing the
      Alteration sphere and the chosen (transformation) talent for the purpose
      of meeting feat prerequisites. If you possess the Perfect Imitation talent
      or Shifting Disguise feat, you may make cosmetic changes to your
      Transformation form per the base Alteration sphere trait.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat may be taken more than once; each
      time gaining a new form and selecting any Alteration (transformation)
      talent or other (transformation) or (body) talent if choosing
      Anthropomorphic transformation.</p>
