      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature; any talent with
      the strike descriptor.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When activating a magic sphere talent with
      the strike descriptor, you may spend a spell point to instead use the
      sphere effect in conjunction with making a full attack. The magic sphere
      effect is delivered through the first successful attack made as part of
      that full attack routine; if no attack is successful, no creature is
      targeted with the magic sphere effect and any spell points spent are
      wasted.</p>
