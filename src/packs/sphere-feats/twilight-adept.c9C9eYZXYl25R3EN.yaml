      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Dark sphere or Light sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your Dark sphere talents or abilities
      continue to function in areas where you or someone else with the Twilight
      Adept feat cast a Light sphere talent or ability. Your Light sphere
      talents or abilities continue to function in areas where you or someone
      else with the Twilight Adept feat cast a Dark sphere talent or ability.
      The MSD to dispel a Light or Dark sphere effect overlapping in this way is
      increased by +2. You may choose to have your Dark and Light sphere talents
      or abilities interact normally if you wish. The light level in overlapping
      areas defaults to the ambient lighting conditions.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> If a Light sphere effect interacts with a
      darkness effect (such as from the Dark sphere) or vice versa, the creator
      of the second effect must succeed at a magic skill check against the
      creator of the first effect.</p>
