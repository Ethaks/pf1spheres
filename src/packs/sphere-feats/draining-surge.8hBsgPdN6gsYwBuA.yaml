      <p>You push yourself into your counterspells to assure their success.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Counterspell, casting class feature,
      magic skill bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you attempt a magic skill check to
      counterspell, you may roll twice and take the higher result. If you do,
      you take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage for every 2 character levels you
      possess. This damage cannot be healed by any means except rest and
      bypasses immunity to nonlethal damage. If you possess the Draining Casting
      drawback, the damage is reduced from 1d6 per 2 levels to 1d4 per 2
      levels.</p>
