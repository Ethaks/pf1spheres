      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere (Transform
      Object).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When targeted by an attack with a
      manufactured weapon within your shapeshift range, you may spend a spell
      point as an immediate action to briefly shapeshift the weapon into an
      animal, disarming your foe. You must be aware of the attack.</p>

      <p>The target is allowed a Will save to negate this effect. On a failed
      save, the weapon immediately transforms into a Small animal or a group of
      Tiny animals and moves a short distance away before returning to its
      original form in a square of your choosing within 30 feet of the target.
      The weapon&#8217;s movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The
      transformed weapon will not pass through dangerous squares such as an
      energy wall, instead stopping in the previous square.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may spend a spell point as a standard action to
      shapeshift a manufactured weapon in the range into a hostile serpent that
      whips around to attack its wielder. The weapon&#8217;s wielder must
      succeed at a Will save or the next time the weapon is used within 1 round
      per caster level for an attack, the damage of the attack is instead dealt
      to the wielder.</p>

      <p>The wielder cannot willingly reduce or deal nonlethal damage with this
      attack. Once the damage has been dealt, the effect is discharged. If you
      spend an additional spell point, the effect persists for 1 round per
      caster level, each attack after the first granting a Will save to end the
      effect.</p>
