Transferred undead may be returned to their owner during this time period as a move action, but can never be transferred to a third ally. After the duration expires, they are considered under your ally&#8217;s control and count towards your ally&#8217;s maximum Hit Dice total of undead they can have reanimated at once.</p>\n",
