      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may spend a spell point and ten minutes
      of preparation to use a sphere effect in such a way that it comes into
      effect under some later condition you have previously dictated. You must
      pay any spell point costs associated with the desired effect and must
      place the effect on yourself or onto a creature or location within close
      range. The creature or area selected must be the target of the sphere
      effect.</p>

      <p>The conditions needed to activate the effect must be clear, but they
      can be general. (If the caster is dropped below half hit points, if an elf
      enters the room, or if Madame Deflour comes within close range are all
      examples of contingency conditions.)</p>

      <p>In all cases, the contingency causes the sphere effect to manifest
      instantly when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or
      convoluted conditions are prescribed, the effect may fail when triggered.
      The effect occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of
      whether you want it to. You may only have one contingency active at a
      time; any previous unused contingency effect is dispelled when a new one
      is created.</p>

      <p>A caster always knows when their contingency is triggered, even if they
      are not present. If a contingency is placed on a creature or location, it
      can be detected and dispelled like any other sphere effect. For this
      purpose, a contingency is considered a magic trap with a Perception and
      Disable Device DC equal to 25 + 1/2 the caster level.</p>

      <p>If a contingency remains unused when a caster rests to regain spell
      points, they may choose to dispel the contingency or sustain it, in which
      case they do not recover the spell points used to create the
      contingency.</p>
