      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere and 5th caster level; or
      Death sphere and 5th caster level; or Duelist sphere and base attack bonus
      +5; or Alchemy sphere and base attack bonus +5; Virulent Ailment,
      character level 7th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> By plunging yourself further into your
      studies, you become a vessel for your disease. You can choose to become
      the host of a single disease you are capable of creating through your
      plague feats. This is a ritual that takes 10 minutes of time, at the end
      of which you must choose to either deal damage to yourself equal to your
      Hit Dice, or spend a spell point.</p>

      <p>Afterwards, you become infected with the disease, but suffer none of
      its negative effects and never need to attempt saving throws against the
      disease (meaning it never cures naturally, but can be cured through magic
      or other methods). This causes all of your natural attacks to gain the
      disease, causing any creature that takes damage from your natural attacks
      must succeed at a save against your hosted disease or be infected by it.
      You may only have one disease selected in this way, although you may use
      the ritual again to infect yourself with a new disease, becoming a host of
      the new disease and curing the old one.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Abilities that primarily use your blood as a
      weapon (such as the Gory Armaments (blood art) talent), or otherwise
      affect a creature using your blood may additionally cause a saving throw
      against the hosted disease, subject to GM discretion.</p>
