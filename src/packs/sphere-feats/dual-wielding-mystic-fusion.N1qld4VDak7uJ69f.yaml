      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dual Wielding Sphere,
      Spherecasting.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a special attack action, while you have
      martial focus you can use your Dual Attack or Combo Maneuvers ability with
      a sphere ability in place of your first offhand weapon attack. The ability
      must be one that requires a touch attack or that can be made with a weapon
      attack and that can be cast with a standard action. The sphere ability has
      its caster level (excluding enhancement bonuses) limited to your BAB and
      provokes attacks of opportunity normally.</p>

      <p>If the sphere ability is a ranged attack, it does not provoke an attack
      of opportunity if you possess the Mixed Assault talent.</p>
