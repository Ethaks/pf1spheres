      <p>Your magic is subtle and difficult to detect.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Incompatible Energies drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The divine ability of the Divination sphere
      has a 50% chance of not detecting any magic effects you create unless the
      Divination effect uses the same Alien Source that you do. Even if the
      effects are detected, their aura is one step weaker than it would normally
      be (meaning faint effects would have no aura).</p>
