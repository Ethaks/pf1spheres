      <p>Miracles of any shape fail to penetrate your defenses.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any spell or power resistance or immunity
      that you possess applies against magic from any source, including those
      from casters with the Alien Source boon. If using any ruleset in which
      psionics and magic are not transparent, any spell resistance or immunity
      that you possess also applies against psionic powers that allow power
      resistance, and vice versa.</p>
