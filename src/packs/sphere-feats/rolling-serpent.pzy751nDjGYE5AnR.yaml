      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Boxing sphere
      (Shoulder Roll).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> As long as you have martial focus, whenever
      a creature makes a melee attack against you while you are using a movement
      mode corresponding to a package you possess, you may use shoulder roll
      against the attack without it counting towards your one usage per
      round.</p>
