      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spell pool; the ability to cast arcane,
      divine, or psychic spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When casting a spell, you may spend 1 spell
      point as a free action to either increase the caster level by 2 or
      increase the spell&#8217;s DC by 2. You cannot spend more than 1 spell
      point in this manner. This does not stack with an arcanist&#8217;s ability
      to increase a spell&#8217;s caster level or DC through the expenditure of
      points from their arcane reservoir.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This feat interacts with traditional
      spells and does not work with magic sphere effects.</p>
