      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere, Destruction sphere
      (Admixture).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using Admixture, you may spend an
      additional spell point to have a single creature that takes damage be
      targeted by blood control (including the free (quicken) or (still) ability
      granted by initiating blood control) that you possess. Creatures already
      under the effects of your blood control instead may be targeted by a
      (quicken) or (still) ability. If you possess the Mass Blood Magic talent,
      you may apply the blood control to all targets damaged, up to your maximum
      number of targets from Mass Blood Magic, though all affected creatures
      must be targeted by the same (quicken) or (still) ability.</p>
