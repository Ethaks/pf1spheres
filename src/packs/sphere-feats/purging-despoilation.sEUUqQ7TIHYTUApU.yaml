      <p>Your destructive magics nullify magical workings.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Terrain Casting drawback, Counterspell,
      Improved Counterspell, casting class feature, magic skill bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you blight, corrupt, or drain an
      area of its nutrients with the Terrain Casting drawback, you may use
      Counterspell or Improved Counterspell as a free action as part of casting.
      You may only target effects within your blighted area.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Defiler Feats:</strong> You may use Greater Counterspell
      (if you have the feat) as a free action as part of casting, targeting
      effects within your blighted area as normal. The spell point cost of any
      counterspell used as part of blighting is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).</p>
