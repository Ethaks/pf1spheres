      "value": "<p>Your revenant-like anger fuels you even in death, granting you one last chance to take down your killers.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, rage class feature; caster level 6th or base attack bonus +6.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you are dealt hit point damage that would kill you, you can spend all your remaining rounds of rage as an immediate action. If you do, you are immediately reanimated as a fast zombie as if you had reanimated yourself, except you possess Hit Dice equal to your racial Hit Dice plus your class level, and your duration is equal to the number of rounds of rage you spent to use this ability. You gain all passive benefits and detriments of your rage despite being undead, and may still use rage powers. Each round, you must attempt to kill the creatures that killed you to the best of your ability, (as determined by the GM), or the duration immediately expires.</p>\n<p>When the duration expires (assuming you were not destroyed while a fast zombie), you are returned to life with -1 hit points (stable), gaining 2 temporary negative levels that last 24 hours.</p>\n<p>You must have at least one round of rage remaining to use this ability, and you can only use this ability once per day.</p>\n",
