      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere; at least one of the
      Skilled Casting, Somatic Casting, or Verbal Casting drawbacks; Circle
      Casting, Spell Proxy.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you use a sphere ability, any
      creature currently under the effects of Create Proxy may take an immediate
      action to perform one of your required components for you. As long as that
      creature meets the criteria for the drawback in question, you may ignore
      it for the purposes of that sphere ability. Regardless of whether or not
      this attempt is successful, the Create Proxy effect ends immediately.</p>
