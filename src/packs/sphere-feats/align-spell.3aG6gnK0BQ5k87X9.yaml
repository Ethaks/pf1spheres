      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you select this feat, choose a
      non-neutral component of your alignment. When you prepare (if you are a
      prepared caster) or cast (if you are a spontaneous caster or spherecaster)
      an aligned spell, choose weal or woe. If you choose weal, all variable,
      numeric effects of the spell are decreased by half (including bonuses to
      those dice rolls) for creatures of that alignment and increased by half
      (including bonuses to those dice rolls) for creatures of the opposite
      alignment.</p>

      <p>If you choose woe, the increase and decrease are the other way around.
      If the spell does not have variable, numeric effects, it instead has its
      saving throw DC and effective spell level decreased by 2 against creatures
      of the selected alignment and increased by 2 against creatures of the
      opposite alignment. If you choose woe, these effects are reversed. The
      spells effects do not change for creatures of neither alignment. Spells
      that neither do damage nor have a saving throw cannot be affected by Align
      Spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful
      evil, or lawful good, you can take this feat twice, each time selecting a
      different component of your alignment. If you are true neutral you may
      choose neutrality with this feat, in which case the damage or effective
      spell level and DC are increased against chaotic evil, chaotic good,
      lawful evil, and lawful good creatures and decreased against true neutral
      creatures.</p>

      <p>If you change alignment such that you no longer have the alignment
      component you chose for this feat, you may immediately choose a different
      component of your alignment (or true neutral if that is your new
      alignment) to use it with. If you already have already taken this feat for
      the only non-neutral component of your new alignment (or for true neutral
      if that is your new alignment) you may immediately retrain this feat at no
      cost to one you qualify for. Atonement reverses this retraining and
      restores this feat. See the &#8220;Retraining&#8221; section of Chapter 3
      in Ultimate Campaign for more information on retraining.</p>
