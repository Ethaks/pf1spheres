    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may cause an instantaneous talent that
      affects an area to persist until the beginning of your next turn. Those
      already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other creatures or
      objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A lingering talent
      with a visual manifestation obscures vision, providing concealment (20%
      miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond
      20 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>
