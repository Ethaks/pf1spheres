    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use 1 dose of contact, ingested,
      inhaled, or injury poison as an additional material component for a talent
      you cast. This talent gains the poison descriptor. Select a single
      creature affected by the talent. If that creature fails its saving throw
      against the talent, it must also attempt a saving throw against the poison
      used as a material component. If the target fails the save against the
      poison, the poison takes effect immediately, ignoring any onset time.</p>

      <p>The poison uses its save DC (rather than the save DC of the talent),
      but is modified by any effects that increase the talent&#8217;s DC (such
      as Spell Focus). This effect works only with talents whose effects can be
      negated by a successful Fortitude save.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>
