      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Diagram Magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may imbue your diagrams with magic that
      triggers on a later time.</p>

      <p>You can imbue a diagram with a magic sphere effect by spending a spell
      point (in addition to any spell point costs of the sphere effect
      itself).</p>

      <p>The imbuement effect lasts for 1 hour per magic skill bonus or until
      activated by a trigger specified by the caster at the time it is created
      (a diagram can only have one trigger). A diagram is considered as
      intelligent as its caster in relation to detecting and following its
      triggers, and can see and hear as well as a humanoid could with regular
      senses and a bonus to Perception equal to your magic skill bonus. The
      trigger can be one of many things, but the diagram runs the risk of being
      deceived if the trigger is too complicated. A diagram knows when it has
      been read, and this information may be used as part of a trigger.</p>

      <p>If the spell effect has a target, the diagram must be large enough to
      encompass all of the targets&#8217; area before triggering. When
      activated, the diagram becomes the center point for the effect, and it
      performs its function, and then the ability ends. A diagram can only hold
      one magic sphere effect and a creature can only be affected by 1 imbued
      effect in a round, regardless of the number of diagrams triggered. You can
      create a hidden imbued diagram by spending an additional full-round action
      to hide it for every 5 feet it occupies.</p>

      <p>A hidden diagram can be seen by effects that detect or sense magic, and
      is detectable as a magical trap. In order for someone to spot one of your
      hidden diagrams it requires a Perception Check with a DC equal to 25 + 1/2
      your magic skill bonus (minimum 1). Disabling the diagram simply requires
      disrupting it.</p>
