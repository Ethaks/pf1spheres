      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere, Counterweight.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Due to your control over your personal
      gravity, you can move on walls and ceilings and other surfaces as if they
      were the ground. If you are tripped or fall prone, the area&#8217;s normal
      gravity reasserts itself and you fall to the ground, taking falling damage
      as appropriate for your distance above the ground.</p>
