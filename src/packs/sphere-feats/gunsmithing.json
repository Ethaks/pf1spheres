      "value": "<p>You know the secrets of repairing and restoring firearms.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If you have access to a gunsmith&#8217;s kit, you can create and restore firearms, craft bullets, and mix black powder for all types of firearms. You do not need to make a Craft check to create firearms and ammunition or to restore firearms.</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting Firearms:</strong> You can craft any early firearm for a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the firearm. At your GM&#8217;s discretion, you can craft advanced firearms for a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the firearm. Crafting a firearm in this way takes 1 day of work for every 1,000 gp of the firearm&#8217;s price (minimum 1 day).</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting Ammunition:</strong> You can craft bullets, pellets, and black powder for a cost in raw materials equal to 10% of the price. If you have at least 1 rank in Craft (alchemy), you can craft alchemical cartridges for a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the cartridge. At your GM&#8217;s discretion, you can craft metal cartridges for a cost in raw materials equal to half the cost of the cartridge. Crafting bullets, black powder, or cartridges takes 1 day of work for every 1,000 gp of ammunition (minimum 1 day).</p>\n<p><strong>Restoring a Broken Firearm:</strong> Each day, with an hour&#8217;s worth of work, you can use this feat to repair a single firearm with the broken condition. You can take time during a rest period to restore a broken firearm with this feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are a gunslinger, this feat grants the following additional benefit. You can use this feat to repair and restore your initial, battered weapon. It costs 300 gp and 1 day of work to upgrade it to a masterwork firearm of its type.</p>\n",
