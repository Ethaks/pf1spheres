      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature; two or more
      talents from any sphere that both have the instill, mass, range or strike
      descriptors.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If you possess two talents from separate
      spheres that both possess the instill, mass, range, or strike descriptors,
      you count as possessing all talents of that corresponding type from all
      spheres that possess such a talent. You must possess the corresponding
      base sphere before gaining access to any talent, and if such a talent can
      be taken multiple times, this only counts as possessing the talent
      once.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a character possesses Energy Strike and
      Cryptic Strike, they would count as possessing all other talents with the
      strike descriptor. If a character possesses Instill Life and Instill
      Death, they would count as possessing all other talents with the instill
      descriptor.</p>
