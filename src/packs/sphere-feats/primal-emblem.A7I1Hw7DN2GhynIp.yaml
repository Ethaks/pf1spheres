      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Banner class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a totem from the War sphere that does
      not require spell points to be spent when it is created. Your banner can
      also create the effects of that totem, using your class level as your
      caster level and your Charisma modifier (or practitioner modifier, if
      using Spheres of Might) as your casting ability modifier, if you do not
      already possess a casting tradition. If the totem produces the same type
      of bonus as your banner, these bonuses stack and are considered a single
      bonus. You can create the effects of the totem for a maximum number of
      rounds per day equal to your casting ability modifier + 1/2 your base
      attack bonus (minimum 1). Activating this ability is a free action, and a
      free action must be spent each round to maintain it.</p>

      <p>You may purchase this feat multiple times. Each time choose another
      totem. Rounds of use of one totem can not be used to fuel a different
      totem. You may only have one totem active at a time.</p>

      <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
