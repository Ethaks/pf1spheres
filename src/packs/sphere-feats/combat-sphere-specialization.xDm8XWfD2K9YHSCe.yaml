    value: >
      <p>Your knowledge of one particular combat sphere is without peer.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 1 or more combat spheres.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Select one combat sphere you possess, you
      treat your base attack bonus as 1 higher for the purposes of its effects,
      but not for attacks made with talents from that sphere. At 5th level and
      every 4 levels afterwards, the chosen sphere&#8217;s base attack bonus is
      treated as an additional 1 higher, although the sphere&#8217;s effective
      base attack bonus cannot be higher than your character level.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may select this feat multiple times, each
      time selecting a different sphere.</p>
