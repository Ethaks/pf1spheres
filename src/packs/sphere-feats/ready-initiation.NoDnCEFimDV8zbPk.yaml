      <p>When one of your allies primes a technique, you respond
      immediately.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Knowledge of at least one technique.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When multiple characters with this feat work
      together to initiate a multi-character technique, the technique is
      performed on the highest of the participants&#8217; initiative counts
      rather than the lowest. All participants have their actions for the turn
      moved up to the initiative count where the technique is performed.</p>
