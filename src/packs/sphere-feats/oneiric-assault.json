      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dreamspace, caster level 10th.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you are in the dreamscape of another creature, you may target that creature&#8217;s real body with a single magic sphere effect as if you were adjacent to the creature. Using this feat causes your presence to be immediately ejected from their dreamscape, returning you to your own dreamscape and separating the two dreamscapes if they are merged. The creature is allowed a Will save against this effect, gaining bonuses to their saving throw as if you had just attempted to scry on the location of their dreamscape (for example, the mental block ritual protects against this ability). The DC is equal to the higher of your Mind sphere or Warp sphere DCs (or your hedgewitch secret DC, if you possess neither sphere). Should they fail their saving throw, the target is immediately affected with the sphere effect upon waking up. If the effect allows a saving throw, the target is allowed a saving throw as normal and applies spell resistance as normal, but any attack rolls used as part of the sphere effect are treated as if they had successfully hit the target.</p>\n<p>If you spend 2 additional spell points on the magic sphere effect, any target which fails their Will saving throw to repel the magic sphere effect becomes fatigued and is unable to regain spell points from rest for the next 24 hours.</p>\n<p>You cannot use this feat in the same dreamscape more than once every 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Special: If a creature possesses special abilities which would apply additional effects to their nightmare spell-like ability (such as the dreams of madness ability of Cthulhu and similar abilities possessed by other Great Old Ones), those effects also apply to any sphere effects created through this feat. If these abilities also expand the targeting possibilities of nightmare (such as dreams of madness targeting any creature with 1 or more ranks in a Craft or Perform skill), the creature with this feat automatically locates the dreamscapes of such creatures and may travel to them through normal means.</p>\n",
