      <p>You have extreme control over your bones and joints, allowing you to
      respond to a variety of physical threats.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, charmed life class
      feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can expend a daily use of charmed life as
      an immediate action to gain one of the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Reduce all damage taken from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
      damage until the start of your next turn by an amount equal to your
      casting ability modifier + 1/2 your character level.</li>

      <li>Add your casting ability modifier as an insight bonus to your CMB and
      CMD until the start of your next turn.</li>

      <li>Ignore all penalties to attack rolls, AC, and movement for being prone
      until the start of your next turn.</li>
