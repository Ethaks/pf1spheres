      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Independent Invention, Tech sphere,
      Drone.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your independent inventions are considered
      drones for purposes from benefiting from effects that affect drones, and
      vice versa. In addition as independent inventions you can select Drones as
      a base form (these independent inventions don&#8217;t count towards the
      maximum number of Hit Dice of drones you may maintain). Your independent
      inventions can be activated or deactivated as if they where drones.</p>

      <p>You may also apply improvements and technical insights to your drones
      (1 improvement for every 10 levels of technician you possess (minimum
      0)).</p>
