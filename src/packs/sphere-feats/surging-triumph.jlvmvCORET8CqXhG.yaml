    value: >
      <p>Your power enables you to achieve even greater effects while in
      Aristeia.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The maximum number of hero points you may
      have at a time increases by 1. When you enter Aristeia, you gain a single
      hero point. This hero point is expended automatically when you leave
      Aristeia, and cannot be used with the Heroic Perseverance feat. When you
      enter Aristeia level 3 or higher, you instead gain two hero points which
      are expended when you leave.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Hero&#8217;s Fortune for
      the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>
