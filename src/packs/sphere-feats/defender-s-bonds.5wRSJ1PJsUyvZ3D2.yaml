      <p>The bonds between a warrior and his faithful companions shine in
      combat.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Beastmastery sphere; lay on hands or
      sentinel&#8217;s reserve class feature, character level 3rd.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you would heal yourself or gain
      temporary hit points from your lay on hands ability or by spending a
      reserve point, you may also affect one animal ally within your natural
      reach, granting that animal ally half the numeric benefits you received as
      though they were targeted by the ability plus any additional effects, such
      as the paladin&#8217;s mercy or sentinel&#8217;s defender&#8217;s
      determination abilities.</p>

      <p>Whenever you restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to an
      animal ally within your natural reach, that animal ally gains the benefits
      of any damage reduction you possess from your class features for 1 round
      (such as damage reduction granted by the dedicated defense class feature,
      not damage reduction from an item, combat or magic sphere effect, or other
      ability).</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A sentinel uses their sentinel&#8217;s
      reserve to gain 14 temporary hit points. One animal ally within the
      sentinel&#8217;s natural reach would gain 7 temporary hit points and any
      damage reduction the sentinel possesses for 1 round.</p>
