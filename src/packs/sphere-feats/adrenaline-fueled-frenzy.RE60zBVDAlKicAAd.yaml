    value: >
      <p>The shark&#8217;s frenzy turns to a churning rage.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere (any (adrenaline)
      talent), Duelist sphere (Bloodied Shark&#8217;s Frenzy), base attack bonus
      +3.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you enter a blood frenzy using the
      Bloodied Shark&#8217;s Frenzy talent, you may also gain the benefits of
      one (adrenaline) talent you possess for the blood frenzy&#8217;s duration.
      If an (adrenaline) talent requires you to expend your martial focus to use
      each round, you do not need to expend martial focus when first entering a
      blood frenzy, but must expend martial focus at the start of each
      subsequent round to gain the benefits of that (adrenaline).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> When you successfully make a brutal strike
      special attack action and deal bleed damage with that attack, you may
      expend your martial focus as a free action to enter a blood frenzy.</p>
