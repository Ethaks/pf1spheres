      <p>When all the pieces come together to make something amazing.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere, ability to share
      teamwork feats, challenge class feature, character level 11th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using your challenge class ability to
      challenge a target, allies you have shared a teamwork feat with (such as
      with the Cavalier&#8217;s tactician ability, Warleader conscript
      specialization&#8217;s born leader ability, the Cavalry Officer
      Cavalier&#8217;s officer ability, or any other similar ability subject to
      GM discretion) and are benefiting from a Warleader tactic you created also
      receive half the benefits of your challenge class ability, including half
      the benefits from your order if applicable (minimum +1). Allies benefit
      from your challenge&#8217;s bonuses until the target of your talent is
      dead or unconscious or until the combat ends.</p>
