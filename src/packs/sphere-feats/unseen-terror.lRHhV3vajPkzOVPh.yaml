      <p>The hunter stalks its prey. The prey knows, but can only run from the
      scraping, rattling, and growling noises which chase them.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Intimidate 3 ranks, Stealth 3
      ranks.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate and Stealth
      checks. Whenever your Stealth check to hide exceeds an opposing
      creature&#8217;s Perception check by 5 or more, you may attempt an
      Intimidate check as a swift action to demoralize one target creature
      within 30 feet who failed to notice you. The target does not need to be
      able to see you, but must be able to hear you. The target is not made
      aware of your location when you Intimidate them with this feat, and making
      an Intimidate check this way does not automatically reveal your location.
      If you are able to use the Intimidate skill to cause a target to become
      frightened or worse, and the target is unaware of your position, the
      frightened creature will attempt to flee to a location it feels is safe,
      treating the location it became frightened at as the source of its
      fear.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Dazzling Display feat or Gladiator sphere, whenever
      you could attempt an Intimidate check as a swift action from this feat,
      you may instead use the Dazzling Display feat or Gladiator sphere strike
      fear ability as a standard action to intimidate all creatures within range
      instead of a single creature, even if you could not normally use those
      abilities as a standard action.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as having the Skill Focus
      feat for either Intimidate or Stealth, chosen when you gain this feat, for
      the purposes of meeting prerequisites.</p>
