      "value": "<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you select this feat, choose a non-neutral component of your alignment. When you prepare (if you are a prepared caster) or cast (if you are a spontaneous caster or spherecaster) an aligned spell, choose weal or woe. If you choose weal, all variable, numeric effects of the spell are decreased by half (including bonuses to those dice rolls) for creatures of that alignment and increased by half (including bonuses to those dice rolls) for creatures of the opposite alignment.</p>\n<p>If you choose woe, the increase and decrease are the other way around. If the spell does not have variable, numeric effects, it instead has its saving throw DC and effective spell level decreased by 2 against creatures of the selected alignment and increased by 2 against creatures of the opposite alignment. If you choose woe, these effects are reversed. The spells effects do not change for creatures of neither alignment. Spells that neither do damage nor have a saving throw cannot be affected by Align Spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good, you can take this feat twice, each time selecting a different component of your alignment. If you are true neutral you may choose neutrality with this feat, in which case the damage or effective spell level and DC are increased against chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good creatures and decreased against true neutral creatures.</p>\n<p>If you change alignment such that you no longer have the alignment component you chose for this feat, you may immediately choose a different component of your alignment (or true neutral if that is your new alignment) to use it with. If you already have already taken this feat for the only non-neutral component of your new alignment (or for true neutral if that is your new alignment) you may immediately retrain this feat at no cost to one you qualify for. Atonement reverses this retraining and restores this feat. See the &#8220;Retraining&#8221; section of Chapter 3 in Ultimate Campaign for more information on retraining.</p>\n",
