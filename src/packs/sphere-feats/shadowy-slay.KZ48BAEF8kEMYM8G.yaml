      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any time you deal damage to a creature from
      an illusion source you may spend a shadow point to allow the creature to
      be briefly attacked through its shadow. Any attack made against the target
      may resolve as a touch attack. This effect lasts 1 minute or until the
      creature is hit by a touch attack.</p>
