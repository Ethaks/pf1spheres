      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A thanatopic talent pierces defenses and
      immunities that protect against death effects, negative levels, and energy
      drain, affecting the target as if the protective barrier did not exist.
      For example, you could cast a thanatopic Vampiric Strike on a target under
      the effects of Deathless, and the target would suffer the normal effect of
      the talent. Saving throws and spell resistance (if any) still apply.
      Undead are susceptible to talents augmented by this feat, as it retunes
      the negative energy to be harmful to them.</p>

      <p>A thanatopic talent that would kill a living creature (such as by
      giving it negative levels equal to its Hit Dice) destroys an undead
      (though undead such as ghosts, liches, and vampires may reform as normal).
      Undead affected by thanatopic talents that give negative levels
      automatically succeed at their saving throws to remove negative levels
      after 24 hours.</p>
