      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Energy Wall (blast
      shape)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may spend an additional spell point when
      using the Energy Wall blast shape. The wall now grants concealment from
      creatures on the other side and any non-magical ammunition passing through
      the wall are destroyed and other non-magical projectiles suffer a -2
      penalty to their attack roll. At caster level 9th the wall can also affect
      ammunition with a +1 enhancement bonus, increasing by +1 for every 3
      caster levels thereafter. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as
      boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural
      attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Demolition talent or apply
      a (blast type) talent that ignores hardness and deals full damage to
      objects, such as Shattering Blast or Disintegrate, treat the wall&#8217;s
      caster level as 3 higher for determining the effects of this feat.</p>
