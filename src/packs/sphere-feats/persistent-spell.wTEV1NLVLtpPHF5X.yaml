    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent
      talent or within its area succeeds at its saving throw against the talent,
      it must attempt another saving throw against the effect. If a creature
      fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the talent,
      as if it had failed its first saving throw. Talents that do not require a
      saving throw to resist or lessen the talent&#8217;s effect do not benefit
      from this feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>
