      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can alter a spell with a range of touch,
      close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using
      the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. Unlike most metamagic
      effects, you may activate this metamagic multiple times for the same
      casting to increase its range.</p>

      <p>Note: This refers only to the targeting range, not the effect
      range.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>
