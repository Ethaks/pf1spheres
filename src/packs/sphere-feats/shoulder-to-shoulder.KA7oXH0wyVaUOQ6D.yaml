      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Grit, luck pool or panache class
      feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you gain this feat, choose a mandate
      from the War sphere. You may spend a point of grit, luck or panache to
      create this mandate between yourself and an adjacent ally as a swift
      action. This is a supernatural ability. For purposes of this mandate, the
      attribute that governs the maximum amount of grit, panache or luck you can
      possess is your casting ability and your base attack bonus is your caster
      level. The mandate lasts for one minute, or ends immediately if you create
      another mandate with this ability, fall unconscious, or if you move beyond
      60 feet from each other.</p>

      <p>If the person you share the mandate with performs an action that would
      allow you to regain grit, luck, or panache, then you may regain grit,
      luck, or panache as if you had performed the action yourself.</p>
