      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Coy Caster.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you create a magic sphere effect while
      observed, you may choose to delay the onset of the effect until you are no
      longer observed, to a maximum number of rounds equal to your casting
      ability modifier (after which the effect dissipates harmlessly and any
      spent spell points are wasted).</p>

      <p>You do not suffer the normal penalties for Coy Caster when using an
      effect in this way. The effect activates immediately when you are no
      longer observed. If only a single creature is observing you, they must
      attempt a Will save every round beyond the first (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster
      level + your casting ability modifier) or momentarily take their attention
      off you, causing the effect to activate immediately.</p>
