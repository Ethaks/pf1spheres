      "value": "<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may consume the brain of an unconscious creature or a creature who has died within the last 24 hours as a fullround action. A corpse preserved by the Corpse Manipulation talent may have its brain consumed in this way within a week of its death. This functions as a coup de grace against a living creature with a base damage of 4d8 + your Strength modifier and a critical multiplier of x2. Doing so grants you a +2 insight bonus to two skills that the creature whose brain you ate possessed ranks in. You may only benefit from having one brain eaten at a time, but these bonuses last until the next time you consume a creature&#8217;s brain. You are immune to any non-magical diseases you are exposed to as part of consuming a creature&#8217;s brain and do not suffer any mundane negative health effects from consuming a creature&#8217;s brain, even if it would not normally be part of your natural diet. You gain no benefit from consuming the brains of subordinates. The creature&#8217;s brain is not eaten if they are not killed by this effect and you cannot consume the brains of creatures that lack brains (at GM discretion).</p>\n",
