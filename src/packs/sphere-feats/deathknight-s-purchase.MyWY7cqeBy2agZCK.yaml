      <p>Their suffering is your salvation. Break their souls across the iron
      that is your will.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. You can spend a
      spell point as an immediate action whenever another creature within close
      range fails a saving throw against a death or negative energy effect to
      infuse yourself with their shredded life force, gaining a number of
      temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your character level plus 1d6 per
      necrosis feat you possess. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute
      per necrosis feat you possess. You cannot use this feat if the affected
      creature has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> You no longer need to spend a
      spell point when using this feat to gain temporary hit points. You may
      spend a spell point as a free action to dismiss the temporary hit points
      from this feat, healing for that same amount. Treat this healing as a
      negative energy effect, healing normally even if you could not heal from
      negative energy.</p>
