These are considered primary natural attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Damnation Feats:</strong> You may gain a natural attack that you did not select for your first Damnation feat or may gain a prehensile tail (as the tiefling racial trait). You count as a tiefling for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Damnation Feats:</strong> All of your natural and weapon attacks count as evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If you are also lawful or chaotic, your attacks count as the corresponding alignment as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Four Damnation Feats:</strong> You gain either wings (which grant you a fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (which grant the ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or DR 5/silver or cold iron (chosen when you take this option) which improves to DR 5/good, chaotic, or lawful (chosen when you gain this improvement) at 10th level.</p>\n",
