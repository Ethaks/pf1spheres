      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere and 5th caster level; or
      Death sphere and 5th caster level; or Duelist sphere and base attack bonus
      +5; or Alchemy sphere and base attack bonus +5; Death sphere (Shroud),
      Virulent Ailment.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. Your diseases carry
      a trace of your necrotic magic. When you afflict a creature with a disease
      through the use of another plague feat, you may also mark that creature
      with necrotic energy as per the Shroud talent. Marked creatures suffering
      from your diseases do not count against the maximum amount of marks you
      may have at a time.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> When you reanimate a creature you
      marked through the use of this feat, the undead created is afflicted with
      a single disease made with your plague feats that it suffered from at the
      time of its death (if the creature suffered from multiple diseases, pick
      one). Whenever that undead strikes with a natural attack, the victim must
      succeed at a saving throw against the disease or suffer from it as normal.
      You may mark creatures afflicted with a disease this way, as per the
      Shroud talent.</p>
