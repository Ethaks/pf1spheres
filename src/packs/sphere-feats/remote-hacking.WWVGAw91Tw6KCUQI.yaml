      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Tech sphere (Remote Control).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your remote control can be used to override
      signals that don&#8217;t belong to you. Locating foreign signals with the
      remote control requires a Craft (mechanical) check opposed by their sphere
      DC. Each time you spend an action to control their gadgets you musts make
      a craft Craft (mechanical) check opposed by their sphere DC +5.</p>

      <p>In place of an activation check or Craft (mechanical) check, each time
      you spend an action to control a foreign gadget, it gets to attempt a Will
      saving throw opposed by your Tech sphere DC.</p>
