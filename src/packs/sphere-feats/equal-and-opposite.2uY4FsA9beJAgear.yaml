      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere, character level
      5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When an enemy performs a combat maneuver
      against you, you may spend an immediate action to roll your own bull rush
      check opposing your opponent&#8217;s, using your caster level as your base
      attack bonus and adding your casting ability modifier instead of your
      Strength modifier but adding any other modifiers excluding size modifiers
      to bull rush checks you may have. This does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity. If your result is greater than the attacking creature&#8217;s
      result, the creature&#8217;s combat maneuver fails. If you beat it by at
      least 5, they instead are forced 5 feet directly away from you for every 5
      by which your roll exceeds theirs. This movement counts as your bull rush
      for the purpose of determining whether the enemy provokes attacks of
      opportunity, but not for any other purposes.</p>
