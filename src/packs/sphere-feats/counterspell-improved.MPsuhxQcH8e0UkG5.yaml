      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature, Counterspell,
      magic skill bonus +10.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the Counterspell feat against a
      creature or object, you may spend an additional spell point to target an
      additional 1 magical effect on the target per 5 caster levels.
      Alternatively, you may spend an additional spell point to affect multiple
      effects in a 20-foot burst. Roll one magical skill check and apply that
      check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by the basic
      Counterspell feat. Objects that are the target of magical effects are also
      targeted by this ability, but magic items are not.</p>

      <p>For each ongoing effect that targets an area and whose point of origin
      is within the counterspell area, apply your magical skill check to end
      that effect. If a magical effect overlaps the counterspell area but is not
      centered within it, apply your magical skill check to end that effect, but
      only within the overlapping area.</p>

      <p>If an object or creature within the area of effect is the result of
      ongoing magic (such as a summoned monster or companion, or an object
      created through the Creation sphere), apply the magical skill check
      against the spell or effect that summoned them, causing them to disappear
      (or return to their home plane) if successful.</p>
