      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Counterspell, Improved Grapple.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When initiating a grapple, you may use the
      Counterspell feat as a free action. Resolve the counterspell attempt prior
      to applying the effects of freedom of movement, the Freedom word of the
      Fate sphere, and similar effects. Additionally, you are always entitled to
      attempt a Spellcraft check to identify such an effect on a creature within
      your reach as a free action.</p>
