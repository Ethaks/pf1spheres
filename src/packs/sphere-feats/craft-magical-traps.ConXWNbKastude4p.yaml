      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Contingency; Craft Apparatus or Craft
      Marvelous Item.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When crafting a marvelous item, you may
      increase the item&#8217;s complexity by 3 to build it as a magic trap
      rather than a marvelous item. Rather than being activated normally, a
      magic trap activates automatically when certain conditions are met, as per
      a sphere effect prepared using the Contingency feat. A magic trap may
      activate based upon the same parameters as a Contingency effect and may be
      perceived and disabled in the same manner as a Contingency effect. A magic
      trap is limited in its activations per day in the same manner as a normal
      marvelous item and cannot be activated more than once per minute. Changing
      a magic trap&#8217;s contingency conditions takes 10 minutes of work by
      the creator or somebody who has successfully disabled the trap with a
      Disable Device check.</p>

      <p>GM discretion is advised in the creation of magic traps. A magic trap
      is considered to have the Area Bound drawback even if you do not have that
      crafting drawback and only functions within 100 feet of the space in which
      it was created.</p>
