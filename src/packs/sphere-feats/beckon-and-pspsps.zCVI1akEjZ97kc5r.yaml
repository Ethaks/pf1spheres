      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Maker&#8217;s call class feature,
      phantom recall class feature, or other similar ability; spherecasting.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> You may spend 1 spell point as a free action
      to regain 1 use of your maker&#8217;s call, phantom recall, or other
      similar class feature. This does not allow you to have more uses of that
      ability than you normally could.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may summon or manifest your eidolon or phantom as a
      full-round action (instead of as 1 minute ritual).</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> A &#8220;similar ability&#8221; is an ability
      with a limited number of uses per day used to teleport your companion,
      eidolon, phantom, or other similar creature to your side. The unchained
      summoner and spiritualist are the two primary examples of this
      ability.</p>
