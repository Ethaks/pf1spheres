      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere, channel energy class
      feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may channel energy and augment it with
      your Life sphere abilities. You must spend the normal spell point cost of
      the ability, but may target any creature that is affected by your channel
      energy, even if they would normally be out of range of your ability. If
      combined with Mass Healing, you may affect every creature affected by your
      channel energy.</p>
