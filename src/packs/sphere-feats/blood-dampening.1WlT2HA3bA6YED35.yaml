      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you trigger a wild magic event (but not
      a major event), you may choose to negate the event by taking 2 points of
      Constitution burn. This decision must be made before the roll is made on
      the wild magic table. If you possess at least 4 wild magic feats, you may
      use this ability on a major event (see Variant Rules) by accepting 4
      points of Constitution burn. If you have at least 6 wild magic feats, the
      burn cost is reduced by 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Ability Burn</strong></p>

      <p>Ability burn functions as ability score damage, but may not be removed
      by any means other than 8 hours of resting, which removes all burn.</p>
