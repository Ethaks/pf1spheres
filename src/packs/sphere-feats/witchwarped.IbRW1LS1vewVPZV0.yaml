      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You are infused with the traits of something
      else other than just your being.</p>

      <p>You gain the Witchmarked general drawback (even if you are not a
      spherecaster) unless you already have it, using your Hit Dice as your
      caster level to determine its effects (if you are not a spherecaster a
      successful Knowledge (arcana) check successfully identifies the abilities
      from this feat rather then your spheres and caster level). You do not gain
      any bonus spell points from possessing the drawback gained exclusively
      from this feat.</p>

      <p>Choose one trait from the Blank Form ability of the Alteration sphere
      or another trait deemed appropriate to your witchmark by the GM. You may
      not select a trait that carries an additional spell point cost. You gain
      that trait as a permanent supernatural ability. This trait only functions
      while your witchmark traits are not suppressed (such as with the Hidden
      Heretic feat). Treat your Hit Dice as your caster level for the purposes
      of this effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> The trait obtained this way counts towards
      the number of traits you may possess when under the effects of Blank Form,
      but is not considered a polymorph effect.</p>

      <p>You may only take this feat as a drawback feat if you already possess
      the Witchmarked drawback from your casting tradition. In which case you
      still gain the extra spell points (or boon) from the drawback, and
      substitute your magic skill bonus for your Hit Dice when calculating the
      abilities of this feat and may use your casting ability modifier for any
      effects that would require one, such as determining saving throw DCs.</p>
