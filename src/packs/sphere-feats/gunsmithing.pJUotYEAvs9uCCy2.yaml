      <p>You know the secrets of repairing and restoring firearms.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If you have access to a gunsmith&#8217;s kit,
      you can create and restore firearms, craft bullets, and mix black powder
      for all types of firearms. You do not need to make a Craft check to create
      firearms and ammunition or to restore firearms.</p>

      <p><strong>Crafting Firearms:</strong> You can craft any early firearm for
      a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the firearm. At your
      GM&#8217;s discretion, you can craft advanced firearms for a cost in raw
      materials equal to half the price of the firearm. Crafting a firearm in
      this way takes 1 day of work for every 1,000 gp of the firearm&#8217;s
      price (minimum 1 day).</p>

      <p><strong>Crafting Ammunition:</strong> You can craft bullets, pellets,
      and black powder for a cost in raw materials equal to 10% of the price. If
      you have at least 1 rank in Craft (alchemy), you can craft alchemical
      cartridges for a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the
      cartridge. At your GM&#8217;s discretion, you can craft metal cartridges
      for a cost in raw materials equal to half the cost of the cartridge.
      Crafting bullets, black powder, or cartridges takes 1 day of work for
      every 1,000 gp of ammunition (minimum 1 day).</p>

      <p><strong>Restoring a Broken Firearm:</strong> Each day, with an
      hour&#8217;s worth of work, you can use this feat to repair a single
      firearm with the broken condition. You can take time during a rest period
      to restore a broken firearm with this feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you are a gunslinger, this feat grants the
      following additional benefit. You can use this feat to repair and restore
      your initial, battered weapon. It costs 300 gp and 1 day of work to
      upgrade it to a masterwork firearm of its type.</p>
