      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Tech sphere, Ammo Spitter, Alchemy
      sphere (formulae) package.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your ammo spitter may create alchemical or
      complex ammunition (such as alchemical cartridges and vial bolts) costing
      50 gp or less. This alchemical ammunition doesn&#8217;t have to be made
      exclusively for firearms but the weapon firing it must still meet all the
      prerequisites (such as having the scatter quality).</p>
