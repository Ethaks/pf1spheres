      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Channel energy class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you channel energy, instead of its
      normal effects, you may instead grant those within range a single attack.
      These attacks are made immediately in initiative order. Each attack
      receives a bonus to damage equal to the number of dice you would have
      rolled for your channel energy.</p>
