      <p>Desperate times call for desperate measures. A working device can save
      your life.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Technological racial trait.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, you may quickly
      jury-rig a repair on a destroyed object, elevating it to functional with
      the broken condition for 1d6 minutes. Any given item can only be so
      repaired once before real work has to be done to coax it back to life. Any
      additional damage will immediately destroy the item again. This does not
      restore magic to a destroyed magic item. Alternately, you may use this
      feat to remove the broken condition from an object for 1d6 minutes, but
      again, only once per object.</p>
