      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Combat Stamina.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can prepare yourself for harm if you have
      advance warning. As a swift action, you may spend 3 stamina points to give
      yourself resistance to one type of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity,
      fire, or sonic). This resistance is equal to your character level + your
      highest mental attribute modifier and lasts 1 minute. You may use this
      ability multiple times to give yourself resistance against different
      energy types.</p>
