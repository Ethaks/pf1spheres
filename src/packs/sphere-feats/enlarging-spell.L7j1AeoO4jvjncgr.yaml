    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can alter a talent with a range of close,
      medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An enlarged talent with a
      range of close now has a range of 50 feet + 5 feet/level, while
      medium-range spells have a range of 200 feet + 20 feet/level and
      long-range spells have a range of 800 feet + 80 feet/level. Talents whose
      ranges are not defined by distance, as well as talents whose ranges are
      not close, medium, or long, do not benefit from this effect.</p>

      <p>Note: This refers only to the targeting range, not the effect
      range.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>
