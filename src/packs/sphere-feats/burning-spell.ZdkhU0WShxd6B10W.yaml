      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The acid or fire effects of the affected
      talent adhere to the affected creature(s), causing more damage the next
      round. When a creature takes acid or fire damage from the affected talent,
      that creature takes damage equal to the talent&#8217;s caster level at the
      start of its next turn. The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the
      spell&#8217;s descriptor. If a burning talent has both the fire and acid
      descriptor, the caster chooses what kind of damage is dealt by the burning
      talent effect.</p>
