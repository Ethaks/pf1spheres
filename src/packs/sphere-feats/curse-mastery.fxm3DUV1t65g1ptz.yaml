      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Innate Curse.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain all the benefits of your oracle
      curse; both the base benefit as well as the benefits that come with
      increasing in level (treat your magic skill bonus as your oracle
      level).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If your curse provides you with spells known,
      instead of normally granting bonus spells (for example, Haunted), you do
      not gain spells or talents. Instead, you gain a bonus spell point at the
      levels you would normally gain the spells.</p>
