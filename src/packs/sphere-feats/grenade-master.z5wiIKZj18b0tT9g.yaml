      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When determining the save DC of an explosive
      or splash weapons such as an alchemical weapon, dust, oil, or potion you
      are activating, you may add your casting ability modifier (or Intelligence
      modifier, if you do not possess the casting class feature) to the save DC.
      This only applies to explosives and splash weapons that do not already add
      an ability modifier to the DC (so while it would apply to alchemical
      weapons, it would not apply to an Alchemist&#8217;s bomb class
      feature).</p>
