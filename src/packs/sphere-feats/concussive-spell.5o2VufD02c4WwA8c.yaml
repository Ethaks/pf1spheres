      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> With sonic damage comes a concussive wave of
      energy that rattles creatures affected by the talent. A concussive talent
      causes creatures that take damage from a talent that has the sonic
      descriptor to take a &#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws,
      skill checks, and ability checks for a number of rounds equal to half the
      caster level of the spell (rounded down, minimum 1). This only affects
      talents with the sonic descriptor.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>
