      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere, caster level 5th.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you take hit point damage and are not flat-footed against the damage&#8217;s source, you may choose to spend spell points as a free action (even when it is not your turn) to delay some or all of the damage, effectively nullifying it for the moment when it occurs. For every spell point spent, you may delay an amount of damage equal to twice your Mind caster level (meaning a level 7 thaumaturge could delay 28 points of damage by spending 2 spell points). The damage is delayed for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier.</p>\n<p>In addition, by spending a spell point as a standard action, you may will your metabolic functions to respond differently. You may delay the effect of poison on yourself by altering its frequency by one step (rounds to minutes, minutes to hours, or hours to days, only usable once per poison), you may use your casting ability score instead of Constitution for holding your breath, and you may add your casting ability modifier as a bonus to checks to disguise your health under close observation (such as when feigning death).</p>\n<p>This is treated as a supernatural ability. Any delayed damage can be taken at a point prior to the expiration of the delay by dismissing the effect, as if dismissing a spell. Healing received while damage is delayed can preemptively negate the damage before the effect ends if you wish. If an attack&#8217;s damage is negated entirely, secondary effects of the damage are also negated if the secondary effect would be negated through damage reduction.</p>\n",
