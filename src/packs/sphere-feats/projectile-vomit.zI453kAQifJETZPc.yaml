      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Barroom sphere (Purge), base attack
      bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> When you utilize your Purge talent, you can
      instead perform it as a standard action, vomiting on all squares in a
      close-ranged cone, instead of the normal area. All affected squares are
      treated affected as per the Purge talent, and creatures in the cone must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for one round. At base
      attack bonus +10 or higher, creatures that fail their Fortitude save are
      instead nauseated for one round, and sickened for one minute afterwards. A
      success negates the nauseate and reduces the sickened duration to one
      round.</p>
