      <p>You are adept at anticipating and interrupting spellcasters.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Extra Combat Talent or combat training
      class feature, base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may expend your martial focus to ready an
      attack action to disrupt a spell caster&#8217;s casting as a move action.
      The spellcaster must be within reach or range of your wielded weapon. A
      single casting attempt cannot trigger more than one readied action to
      interrupt from you.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat a second time. If you
      do, you may instead use this ability as a swift action.</p>
