      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> This feat allows for the creation of
      talent-based magic items that require no activation except to hold, wear,
      or carry them.</p>

      <p>Creating an apparatus costs 2,000 gp x caster level x complexity. An
      item must have an effect measured in hours to be made into an apparatus.
      Thus, as an example, if making an apparatus of the War sphere totem
      talent-based item creation effect, which is measured in rounds, the effect
      would need to have its duration increased by 3 steps (+6 complexity)
      before it could be made into an apparatus.</p>

      <p><strong>Continual Life Sphere Effects:</strong> Creating an apparatus
      that grants what is normally an instantaneous effect, such as Life sphere
      effects, has a base complexity of 6. If crafting an apparatus that grants
      a continual cure, the effect becomes instead fast healing 1 (+1 per
      additional +1 in complexity). If an apparatus grants a continual restore,
      it instead grants immunity to one effect (+1 per additional +1 in
      complexity; a creature cannot gain immunity to effects that require a
      magic skill check to remove or are unaffected by the Life sphere).
      Temporary hit points cannot be made into a continual effect.</p>
