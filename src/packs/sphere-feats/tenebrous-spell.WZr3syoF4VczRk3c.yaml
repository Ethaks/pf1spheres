      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you cast a tenebrous talent in darkness
      or dim light, the spell&#8217;s effective caster level is increased by 2
      and any associated save DCs are increased by 1. Any attempts at dispelling
      a tenebrous talent in darkness or dim light take a &#8211;2 penalty on the
      check. Casting a tenebrous talent in bright light is difficult, and
      requires a concentration check (DC 15 + the tenebrous talent&#8217;s
      effective caster level). Attempts to dispel a tenebrous talent in bright
      light gain a +4 bonus on the check. You cannot use this effect on talents
      with the light descriptor.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>
