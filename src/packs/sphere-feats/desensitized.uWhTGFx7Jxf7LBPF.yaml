      <p>Your experience with the horrific dulls the impact of atrocities.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Whenever you would take sanity damage, that
      sanity damage is reduced by 1 for every lesser madness you possess and by
      3 for every greater madness you possess. This cannot reduce sanity damage
      taken below 1.</p>
