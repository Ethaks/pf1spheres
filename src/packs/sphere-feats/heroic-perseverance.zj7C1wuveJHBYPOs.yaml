      <p>Destiny&#8217;s hand prevents you from faltering after your grand
      display.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add the number of Aristeia feats you possess
      to the number of times per day you can use any combat feats you have that
      allows a limited number of daily uses, such as the Stunning Fist feat. If
      you still have Aristeia points remaining when you end your Aristeia, you
      may choose to expend them in place of suffering negative levels from
      Aristeia. For every point expended, you negate one permanent negative
      level from Aristeia.</p>

      <p>This feat counts as the weapon training and armor training class
      features for all weapons and armor for the purpose of meeting
      prerequisites, with your effective weapon training or armor training bonus
      being equal to the number of Aristeia feats you possess.</p>
