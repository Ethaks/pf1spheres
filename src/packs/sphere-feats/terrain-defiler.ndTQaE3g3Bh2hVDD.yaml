      <p>You can increase the damage to the land around you to amplify your
      power.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Terrain Casting drawback, non-good
      alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you blight, corrupt, or drain an
      area of its nutrients with the Terrain Casting drawback, you may choose to
      increase the radius of the corrupted area by 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels of the sphere talent or ability used. Doing so decreases the spell
      point cost of any metamagic feat by 1 (minimum 0), but also increases the
      time required for the area to naturally recover to 10 years per caster
      level of the sphere talent or ability used.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Defiler Feats:</strong> When using this feat, you may
      choose to increase the radius of the corrupted area by an additional 5
      feet per 5 caster levels (minimum 5 feet) to decrease the spell point of
      cost of any metamagic feat by an additional 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You cannot gain this feat if you possess the
      Terrain Focus feat and vice versa.</p>
