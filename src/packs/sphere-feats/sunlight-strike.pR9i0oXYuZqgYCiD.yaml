      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Light sphere; Arcane Strike or Imbued
      Strike.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you successfully hit an enemy that
      is vulnerable to light (such as by the light blindness, light sensitivity,
      or sunlight powerlessness universal monster rules) with a melee weapon you
      have imbued with your Arcane Strike or Imbued Strike feat, you deal an
      additional 1d6 points of damage to the target of your attack. The struck
      creature must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your
      character level + your Strength modifier) or become staggered for 1 round.
      This bypasses the immunity to Fortitude saves usually granted by some
      creature types.</p>
