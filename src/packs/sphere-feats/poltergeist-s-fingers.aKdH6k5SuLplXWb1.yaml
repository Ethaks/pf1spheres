      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sleight of Hand 3 ranks, Telekinesis
      sphere, Mind Limb.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use your telekinetic limb to perform
      steal combat maneuvers and make Sleight of Hand checks to hide an object,
      palm a weapon, or take something unnoticed. Perception checks to notice
      you doing so take a penalty equal to half your character level, and when
      you successfully perform a steal combat maneuver or take something
      unnoticed you may make a Sleight of Hand check to hide it as a free
      action.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Aggressive Mind Limb feat,
      you may use your additional attack of opportunity with your mind limb to
      attempt a steal combat maneuver.</p>
