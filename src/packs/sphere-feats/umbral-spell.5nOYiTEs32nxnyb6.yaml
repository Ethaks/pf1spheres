      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> An umbral talent gains the darkness
      descriptor. As long as the talent is in effect, the creature or object
      affected radiates darkness in a 10-foot radius, reducing illumination
      similar to the effects of the basic effect of the Dark sphere. Nonmagical
      sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light
      level in this area.</p>

      <p>Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected
      by an umbral talent if they are of a higher level than the umbral
      talent&#8217;s caster level. This effect does not stack with itself or
      with any other effect that creates darkness.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>
