      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere or Mind sphere;
      Counterspell.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you successfully counter a spell, the
      caster must succeed at a Will save equal to your Illusion sphere DC or
      Mind sphere DC (whichever is greater), or believe the spell had its
      intended effect, even if they would otherwise be aware of its failure.
      Treat this effect as a figment with a duration equal to the countered
      spell, and use the rules for interacting with and investigating
      figments.</p>
