      <p>Your nerves fail, increasing your pain tolerance and general
      resilience.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. You can spend a
      spell point as an immediate action to gain a +1 bonus to natural armor and
      DR/- for 1 round. For each necrosis feat you possess beyond this one, the
      natural armor bonus and damage reduction increase by 1 and the duration
      increases by 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> You gain half the normal benefit
      of this feat at all times (increasing to the full benefit when you spend a
      spell point).</p>
