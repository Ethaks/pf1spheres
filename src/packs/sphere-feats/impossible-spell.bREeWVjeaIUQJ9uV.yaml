    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Impossible spells can be applied to any magic
      effect which allows a Will save. Creatures that fail their Will saving
      throw against the effect take 1d3 sanity damage. This die sizes increases
      by 1 (1d3-&gt;1d4-&gt;1d6-&gt;1d8-&gt;1d10-&gt;2d6) for every 4 caster
      levels you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This spell uses the sanity/strain system
      introduced in Horror Adventures and expanded upon in The Cataclysm
      Handbook. Games that do not use this system should not incorporate this
      feat.</p>
