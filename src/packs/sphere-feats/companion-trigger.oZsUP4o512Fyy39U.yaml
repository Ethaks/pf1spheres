      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Animal Companion class feature, Mount
      class feature, or Beastmastery sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When your animal companion or a creature you
      are mounted on succeeds on a combat maneuver, you may expend your martial
      focus as a free action even when it is not your turn to count the maneuver
      as though you had performed it for the purpose of any feats or talents you
      possess.</p>
