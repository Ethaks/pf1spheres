      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere, Terrain Casting
      drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have learned to draw upon the nutrients
      in some terrain more easily than others, which powers your primal magics.
      Choose one of the following terrains: Cold, Desert, Forest, Jungle,
      Mountain, Plains, Planes (pick one, other than the Material Plane), Swamp,
      Underground, Urban, or Water. Gain a +2 insight bonus to caster level with
      the Nature sphere while using magic within the chosen terrain.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its
      effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new
      terrain. You cannot gain this feat if you possess the Terrain Defiler
      feat.</p>
