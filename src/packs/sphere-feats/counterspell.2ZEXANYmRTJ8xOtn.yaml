      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature, magic skill
      bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may spend a spell point as a standard
      action to dispel an existing magical effect on a creature, item, or
      location within medium range. You may target a specific effect if you have
      identified it, otherwise the effect with the highest caster level on the
      target is automatically targeted. Alternatively, you may ready an action
      to use this ability to counter a spell or magical effect cast by another.
      In both cases, you must succeed at a magic skill check against the caster
      or magical effect in question. If you succeed then the targeted effect is
      destroyed.</p>

      <p>If you target a magic item, the item is not destroyed; instead the
      item&#8217;s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which
      the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes
      nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening
      (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item&#8217;s
      physical properties are unchanged; a suppressed magic sword is still a
      sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected
      by mortal magic such as this.</p>

      <p>This is treated as a sphere effect, and it is subject to all rules as a
      sphere ability, is affected by the caster&#8217;s casting tradition, and
      can itself be countered by another caster.</p>
