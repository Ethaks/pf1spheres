      <p>The gifts you bestow can be taken away should their recipients fail to
      serve you.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Fleeting Spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you create a magic sphere effect with
      the Fleeting Spell feat, you may set a condition in the same manner as the
      Contingency feat. When this condition is triggered, the sphere effect
      immediately ends as if you had dismissed it. In addition, you may apply
      the Fleeting Spell feat to permanent (but not instantaneous) magic sphere
      effects</p>
