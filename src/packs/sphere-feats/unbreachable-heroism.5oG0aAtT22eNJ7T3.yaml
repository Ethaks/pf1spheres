      <p>You are difficult to take down in your combat-enhanced state.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you roll initiative or regain
      martial focus, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your character
      level. These temporary hit points last for the duration of the
      encounter.</p>

      <p>When you enter Aristeia, you gain temporary hit points equal to your
      character level times your Aristeia bonus. These temporary hit points last
      as long as you remain in Aristeia, and you may replenish them as a free
      action by spending an additional Aristeia point.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Toughness for the purpose
      of meeting prerequisites.</p>
