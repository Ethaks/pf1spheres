      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Magic skill bonus +3.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Just as a weapon can grant enhancement
      bonuses to its wielder&#8217;s attack and damage rolls, an implement of
      power serves as a focus for magical power, adding enhancement bonuses to
      its wielder&#8217;s caster level with a particular sphere. These bonuses
      are always enhancement bonuses, and therefore multiple implements
      benefiting the same sphere do not stack.</p>

      <p>These bonuses only apply to the wielder; this bonus does not apply to
      spell engines nor other magic items they might be using. Implements of
      Conjuration, Death, and Enhancement do not increase the number or
      statistics of companions, undead, or animated objects; instead, such
      implements grant circumstance bonuses to the creature&#8217;s attack rolls
      and skill checks.</p>

      <p>Most implements are staves; 3-5 feet long sticks of wood or metal that
      the caster holds, but an implement can take any shape. Just like a magical
      weapon, an implement of power has its cost calculated according to its
      maximum bonus; an implement of power grants an enhancement bonus from +1
      to +5, with a total possible bonus of +10. Just like a magic weapon, an
      implement costs 2,000 gp x (total bonus) squared.</p>

      <p>An implement uses the crafter&#8217;s MSB rather than their caster
      level when determining the maximum caster level implement they can create.
      The item&#8217;s caster level must be at least 3x the enhancement bonus
      granted by the implement. If the implement has other magical enchantments
      placed upon it, use the highest caster level. An implement must have at
      least a +1 enhancement bonus to have any other implement special
      abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Implements cannot be used to meet caster level
      prerequisites. If a talent has prerequisites, the user or the staff must
      have access to all prerequisites to use that talent. Implements can be
      either slotted items or handheld items, like staves or weapons. They can
      be combined with other magic items as normal.</p>
