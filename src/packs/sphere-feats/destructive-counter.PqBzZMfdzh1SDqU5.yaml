      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (any (material)
      talent).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When targeted by a ranged attack or spell
      effect that originates from another square (such as a destructive blast
      but not a vortex from (water) geomancing), or being in a square that such
      an effect passes through (such as an Energy Sphere destructive blast), you
      may attempt to destroy the projectile or spell effect as an immediate
      action by spending 1 spell point (this spell point cost can not be reduced
      in any way). If the attack is a projectile, it functions as normal unless
      it loses half or more of its hit points and gains the broken condition,
      suffering the usual effects, or is destroyed at which point it deals no
      damage. If the target is a spell effect of a material you can affect with
      your alter ability (for example, a fire damage destructive blast with
      Plasma Production, or a dropped stone object with Expanded Materials) you
      may attempt to damage the spell effect.</p>

      <p>You must succeed at a magic skill check against the caster in question.
      If you succeed then the targeted effect is damaged. Reduce the damage the
      spell effect would deal by 1d6 per caster level (increasing to 1d8 per
      caster level plus your casting ability modifier if you possess Potent
      Alteration). If this would reduce the spell&#8217;s damage to 0, the
      effect ends when it reaches your square. If the targeted spell deals no
      damage, instead lower any save DC it might have by your casting ability
      modifier. If this would reduce the save DC to 9 or lower, the effect ends
      when it reaches your square. Any effect that would occur in or beyond your
      square is negated while any square the effect passed through prior to
      yours is affected normally.</p>
