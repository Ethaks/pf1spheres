      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dreamspace, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you are in the dreamscape of another
      creature, you may target that creature&#8217;s real body with a single
      magic sphere effect as if you were adjacent to the creature. Using this
      feat causes your presence to be immediately ejected from their dreamscape,
      returning you to your own dreamscape and separating the two dreamscapes if
      they are merged. The creature is allowed a Will save against this effect,
      gaining bonuses to their saving throw as if you had just attempted to scry
      on the location of their dreamscape (for example, the mental block ritual
      protects against this ability). The DC is equal to the higher of your Mind
      sphere or Warp sphere DCs (or your hedgewitch secret DC, if you possess
      neither sphere). Should they fail their saving throw, the target is
      immediately affected with the sphere effect upon waking up. If the effect
      allows a saving throw, the target is allowed a saving throw as normal and
      applies spell resistance as normal, but any attack rolls used as part of
      the sphere effect are treated as if they had successfully hit the
      target.</p>

      <p>If you spend 2 additional spell points on the magic sphere effect, any
      target which fails their Will saving throw to repel the magic sphere
      effect becomes fatigued and is unable to regain spell points from rest for
      the next 24 hours.</p>

      <p>You cannot use this feat in the same dreamscape more than once every 24
      hours.</p>

      <p>Special: If a creature possesses special abilities which would apply
      additional effects to their nightmare spell-like ability (such as the
      dreams of madness ability of Cthulhu and similar abilities possessed by
      other Great Old Ones), those effects also apply to any sphere effects
      created through this feat. If these abilities also expand the targeting
      possibilities of nightmare (such as dreams of madness targeting any
      creature with 1 or more ranks in a Craft or Perform skill), the creature
      with this feat automatically locates the dreamscapes of such creatures and
      may travel to them through normal means.</p>
