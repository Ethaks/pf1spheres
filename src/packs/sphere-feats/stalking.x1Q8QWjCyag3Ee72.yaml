      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While using stalking purr, you and your
      allies gain the benefits of partial cover while adjacent to another
      creature. In addition, while using the stalking purr, an ally who begins
      their turn in your purring aura may move at full speed using the Stealth
      skill without penalty.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> While using the stalking purr, an
      ally who begins their turn in your purring aura gains concealment (20%
      miss chance) for 1 round. This concealment is lost after an attack misses
      due to this concealment. Concealment granted by this ability is not
      sufficient enough to allow a creature to use the Stealth skill to hide
      while observed.</p>
