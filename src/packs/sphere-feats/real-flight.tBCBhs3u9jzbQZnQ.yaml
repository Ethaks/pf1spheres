      <p>Flying comes as naturally to you as breathing and your airborne talents
      are often the source of great envy among your peers.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Draconic subtype, breezeflight,
      character level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using breezeflight, you become
      weightless instead of half-weight. The penalties to CMB and CMD increases
      to -4, and you gain a fly speed of 30 ft with average maneuverability
      instead of making an Acrobatics check.</p>
