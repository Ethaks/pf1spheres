      <p>You&#8217;ve carefully developed your poison for greater
      versatility.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Poison Spitter, poison eater alraun,
      character level 7th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can change your poison&#8217;s type (from
      injury to contact, ingested, or inhaled) by expending twice as many of
      your daily uses as normal. When used as an inhalation poison, your poison
      fills one adjacent 5-ft.-square for a number of rounds equal to half your
      hit dice, affecting the first creature to enter that square.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Alraun poison is an injury poison.</p>
