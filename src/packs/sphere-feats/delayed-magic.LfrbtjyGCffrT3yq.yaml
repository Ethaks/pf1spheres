    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You delay the effect of a sphere ability for
      up to 5 rounds after you use it, +1 round per caster level. You must
      select the amount of delay when using the effect. The area or target to be
      affected must be within range when the ability is used, but need not
      remain in your range (you or it may move) before the effect activates.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>
