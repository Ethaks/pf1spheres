      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Circle Casting,
      Spell Proxy.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you fail a saving throw against a
      sphere effect, any creature within that is currently under the effects of
      Create Proxy may spend an immediate action to allow you to reroll your
      saving throw. Doing so causes Create Proxy to immediately end for that
      creature.</p>
