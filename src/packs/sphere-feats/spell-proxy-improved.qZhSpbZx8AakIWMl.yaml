      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Circle Casting,
      Spell Proxy.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you use Create Proxy, you may also
      transfer the concentration to maintain one sphere effect to the targets.
      If they possess spell points of their own, they may spend them in your
      place to have the effect continue without concentration.</p>
