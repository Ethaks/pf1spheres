      <p>Whether through acts of charlatanism or infusing your paints with
      latent magic, you&#8217;ve become skilled with using your paints to depict
      cryptic, almost prophetic imagery.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere (War Paint
      (formulae)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Instead of applying a prepared war paint to a
      creature, you may pour a prepared war paint over a blank piece of
      parchment, scroll, or other surface that can easily hold writing. You may
      then spend 10 minutes concentrating on a specific action or event in the
      near future, as the paint forms a short, cryptic phrase or abstract image.
      This acts as the Augury (divine) Divination talent, using your ranks in
      Craft (alchemy) as your caster level, except you always get a meaningful
      reply. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your
      casting or practitioner modifier, whichever is higher (minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess another (divine) talent from
      the Divination sphere, you may benefit from that sphere effect instead of
      Augury.</p>
