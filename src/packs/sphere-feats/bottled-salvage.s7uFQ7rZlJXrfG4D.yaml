      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Vampiric Casting drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When draining a creature, you may instead
      spend 1 minute harvesting the blood of that creature, creating a single
      bottle of their blood. You can only harvest the blood from a number of
      creatures equal to your casting ability modifier each week, and bottled
      blood expires after a week of being bottled. You may drink bottled blood
      at any time as if it were a potion to grant yourself +1 morale bonus on
      the next saving throw you attempt for one minute, and be treated as if you
      drained the creature of which you created the bottle of blood from.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You can mix a bottle of blood with any other
      potion, formulae, or similar item to gain the effects of drinking bottled
      blood whenever you drink that potion or use the formulae on yourself. If
      you have taken the Vampiric Casting drawback twice, the morale bonus
      applies to all saving throws made for one minute after consumption, rather
      than only one, and stacks with itself up to +2.</p>
