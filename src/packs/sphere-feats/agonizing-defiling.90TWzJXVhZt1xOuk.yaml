      <p>Your powers drain the energies of those around you.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Terrain Casting drawback, non-good
      alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you blight, corrupt, or drain an
      area of its nutrients with the Terrain Casting drawback, you may choose to
      weaken all creatures caught inside the defiled area. Creatures other than
      yourself inside the corrupted area become sickened for one round per
      caster level (Fortitude save negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your character level +
      your casting ability modifier).</p>

      <p><strong>Four Defiler Feats:</strong> Any creatures that fail their
      saving throw against this feat are nauseated for 1 round in addition to
      being sickened.</p>
