      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> While using the soothing purr, you and
      allies within your purring aura gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made
      against pain effects. This bonus also applies on skill checks, saving
      throws, and ability checks made against an ongoing effect, but not the
      initial check to avoid the effect (such as a saving throw to stop being on
      fire or a Strength check to break out of an icy prison spell).</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> Whenever a creature benefiting from
      the soothing purr would receive healing, increase the healing received by
      half your character level. This increased healing has no effect on effects
      such as fast healing, regeneration, and other similar effects.</p>
