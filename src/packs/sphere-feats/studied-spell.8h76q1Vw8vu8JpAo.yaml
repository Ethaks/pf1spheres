      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When casting a studied talent, designate one
      target affected by the spell. Attempt an appropriate Knowledge check based
      on that target&#8217;s creature type as you cast the talent. The DC for
      this check is equal to 20 + the creature&#8217;s CR based on its race and
      not including any class levels or templates (a creature that is defined by
      class levels has an effective CR of 0 for this ability). If you succeed,
      your studied talent ignores any energy resistance or damage reduction the
      target has because of its race as well as any bonuses on saving throws
      against the talent granted by the target&#8217;s race (such as the bonus
      from a dwarf&#8217;s hardy ability or a halfling&#8217;s halfling luck
      ability). Your studied talent does not ignore energy resistance, damage
      reduction, or saving throw bonuses granted by other talents and effects.
      If you fail the Knowledge check, the talent still has its normal
      effects.</p>
