      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 5 ranks in any 1 skill.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may perform an incantation in which you
      are the primary caster that does not have the requisite number of
      secondary casters. For every secondary caster omitted from the
      incantation, the DC of all skill checks associated with the incantation
      increase by 2.</p>
