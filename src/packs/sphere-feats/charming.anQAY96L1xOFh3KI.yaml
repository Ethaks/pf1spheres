      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> While using the charming purr, enemies
      within your purring aura suffer a -1 penalty on saving throws made against
      charm and compulsion effects you create. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus
      on skill checks made to improve the attitude of a creature within your
      purring aura (such as using Diplomacy or Intimidate).</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> The charming purr&#8217;s penalty
      and bonus increase to -2 and +6 respectively.</p>
