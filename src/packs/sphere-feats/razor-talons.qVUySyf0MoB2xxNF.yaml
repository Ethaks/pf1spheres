      <p>Though not built for fine manipulation, your talons can serve well
      enough as a last line of defense.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Fenghuang subtype.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain two talon attacks that deal standard
      damage for your size (1d4 at medium). These are primary attacks that may
      only be taken while airborn.</p>
