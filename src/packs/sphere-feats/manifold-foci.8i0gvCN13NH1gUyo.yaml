      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Center Of Power or Focus Casting.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You possess multiple foci or multiple centers
      of power, to a maximum of your casting ability modifier. You may use any
      of these focuses to cast if you have the Focus Casting drawback and are
      not dazed by having your Center Of Power targeted unless all of your other
      centers of power have been struck by attacks since you last regained spell
      points. However, you take a -1 penalty to your caster level for each of
      foci or centers of power that has been damaged since you last regained
      spell points. This penalty is reduced by 1 whenever you repair one of your
      foci or receive healing which equals or exceeds your MSD (in which case
      you choose one of your centers of power to no longer be considered
      damaged). For every undamaged focus or center of power you are using
      beyond the first, you gain a +1 bonus on concentration checks made to cast
      defensively.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Combat Casting for the
      purposes of meeting other prerequisites that depend on it. This
      feat&#8217;s benefits to concentration checks do not stack with Combat
      Casting.</p>
