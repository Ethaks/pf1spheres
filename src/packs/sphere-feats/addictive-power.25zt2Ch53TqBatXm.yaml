      drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your enhancements satisfy your addiction, to
      a degree; whenever you spend a spell point to relinquish concentration on
      an enhancement targeting yourself, the time until you begin suffering
      penalties extends to the end of the enhancement&#8217;s duration. In
      addition, you gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws while you are suffering
      the penalties from your addiction.</p>
