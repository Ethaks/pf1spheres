      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> While using the calming purr, you and allies
      within your purring aura gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against
      mind-affecting effects and to the DC to Intimidate them. Each creature
      benefiting from the calming purr may spend a move action to lessen the
      severity of any fear effect they are subject to (panicked to frightened to
      shaken to unaffected). Each creature may only benefit from this feat to
      lessen a fear effect once per round; a creature may take an action to
      lessen a fear effect even if they would be required to run from the source
      of their fear first.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> Creatures benefiting from the
      calming purring may lessen the severity of a fear effect as a free action
      and may reduce cowering to panicked. A creature benefiting from the
      calming purring rolls twice and takes the better result when attempting a
      saving throw which the calming purr grants a bonus against.</p>
