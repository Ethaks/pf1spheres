    value: >
      <p>Teleporting away from you is not a solution in your pinnacle state.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When a creature you threaten or that you have
      damaged in the last round attempts a concentration check to use an effect
      that would teleport them or move to another plane, increase the DC of the
      check by 4. While in Aristeia, you may spend an attack of opportunity to
      move with any creature you see that attempts to teleport or shift planes,
      arriving in the same position relative to them wherever they arrive.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Disruption for the
      purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>
