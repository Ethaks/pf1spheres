      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Kismet pool.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As long as you have at least one kismet point
      remaining you automatically succeed on Constitution checks to stabilize
      and may roll saving throws against effects that would kill you outright
      (but not that would kill you through damage or other effects) twice and
      take the better result.</p>
