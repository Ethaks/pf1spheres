      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wis 13, base attack bonus +2.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When attacking a target with a miss chance
      granted from a spell, sphere effect, supernatural or spell-like ability,
      you may take a penalty to your attack roll to reduce the miss chance for
      that attack. Each -1 penalty to the attack roll you take reduces the miss
      chance by 10%. You cannot use this feat to take a penalty greater than
      half of your base attack bonus (rounded up).</p>
