      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Rebuff (blast
      shape)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever a creature within range is the
      target of a ranged attack, you may spend a spell point as an immediate
      action to target the projectile with a destructive blast. Make an opposed
      attack roll using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus to
      destroy the projectile and negate the attack. Unusually massive
      projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks
      generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this
      ability.</p>
