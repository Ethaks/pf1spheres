      <p>Your control over the woven vines extending from your body is extreme,
      and when wrapped around your arm can be quite dangerous.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Draide alraun</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your reach when making melee touch attacks is
      increased by +5 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat a total of twice. When
      taken a second time, your normal reach is increased by +5 ft., and you may
      make touch attacks at +5 ft beyond that.</p>
