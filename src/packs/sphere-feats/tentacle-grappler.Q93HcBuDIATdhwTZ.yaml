    value: >
      <p>Enemies quickly learn to fear your tentacles&#8212; even being grazed
      by your many appendages can lead to a quick death.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Tentacle Master, Tentacle Adept,
      Tentacle Novice, Improved Unarmed Strike.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Once per round when you successfully attack a
      target with your tentacles, you may make a grapple combat maneuver against
      that target as a free action. This does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Making a grapple combat maneuver check is a
      standard action.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Though this has a stance feat as a
      requirement, Tentacle Grappler is not a stance feat.</p>
