      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere (Web Spinner
      (form)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your companion may use its web ability a
      number of times per minute equal to its Constitution modifier.
      Additionally, as a full-round action, your companion may render a creature
      that is entangled by its web and within its reach helpless. Such a
      creature counts as being tied up, increasing the DC to escape to 20 + 1/2
      of the companion&#8217;s Hit Dice + Constitution modifier. The helpless
      creature may still attempt Strength and Escape Artist checks to free
      themselves as normal.</p>
