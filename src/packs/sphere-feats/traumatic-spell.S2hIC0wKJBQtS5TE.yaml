      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A traumatic talent causes lingering memories
      of pain and suffering in creatures harmed by it. When a creature fails a
      saving throw against a traumatic talent, the next time it sleeps it must
      succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to the original talent&#8217;s DC
      or be affected as if by nightmare (as the spell). Each time the target
      fails its save, it must save again the following night or be affected by
      another nightmare, though the save DC decreases by 2 each night after the
      first. This metamagic effect can be applied only to talents with the
      emotion or fear descriptor.</p>
