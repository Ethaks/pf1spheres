      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere, Mind Limb, base
      attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As long as your telekinetic limb is not
      carrying anything you may make attacks with it, using your casting ability
      modifier in place of your Strength modifier on the attack roll. This
      counts as an unarmed attack, but does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity. It deals nonlethal damage equal to your unarmed damage plus
      your casting ability modifier. You may also make one additional attack of
      opportunity per round, but it must be with your telekinetic limb. You may
      not use this attack of opportunity to do anything other than attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you also have Telekinetic Fist, your
      telekinetic limb&#8217;s reach increases by 5 feet.</p>
