      "value": "<p>Whisper your lamentations to the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. Whenever you speak, you can choose to broadcast your voice to all creatures within a medium range, allowing anyone to hear you speak as though you were adjacent to them. Attempts to muffle your voice through mundane methods (such as covering your mouth, being gagged, etc.) fail to silence you and allow you to provide verbal components through such attempts to silence you, such as those required by the Verbal Casting general drawback. Magical, supernatural, and extraordinary silencing effects still function normally.</p>\n<p>You can add verbal components when casting any sphere effect with the curse or death descriptor or that deals negative energy damage, causing you to be clearly heard by anyone as though broadcasting your voice. If you do, creatures that can hear you broadcast your voice and fail their saving throw against the sphere effect take a -2 on attack rolls against you for a number of rounds equal to the number of necrosis feats you possess. If the effect does not have a saving throw, an affected creature attempts a Will saving throw against the sphere effect&#8217;s regular DC instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> When broadcasting your voice, you have greater control over the pitch and distance, from a minimum of 30 feet, to a maximum of long range. If you spend a spell point when adding verbal components to a sphere effect with this feat, creatures who fail their saving throw take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, not just attack rolls against you.</p>\n",
