    value: >
      <p>With lightning reflexes, you sweep your tail against an opponent that
      has left them exposed, knocking them down.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Tail natural attack, base attack bonus
      +6.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using your tail to make an attack of
      opportunity, you may make a free trip combat maneuver that does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity against a target if you successfully hit
      it.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Improved Trip feat or are
      otherwise unable to provoke an attack of opportunity when making a trip
      attempt, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMB with this trip attempt.</p>
