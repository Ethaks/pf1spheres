      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Swallow whole, Alteration sphere
      (Serpentine Transformation (transformation)), or Death sphere (Tomb Of
      Flesh); Warp sphere (Extradimensional Room (space)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you swallow a creature whole or entrap
      them using Tomb Of Flesh, you may shunt it into your extradimensional room
      or into a seemingly endless maze of entrails rather than your stomach. You
      may choose whether or not a creature in your extradimensional room takes
      damage as if swallowed whole, but either way a creature may attempt to cut
      their way out of your extradimensional room as if you had swallowed the
      creature whole. If a swallowed creature successfully cuts its way out of
      you, it must attempt an Intelligence check (DC 10 + 1/2 your Warp or
      Alteration sphere caster level) as it crawls out of the hole. If the
      victim is successful, it escapes you, but on a failure, the victim merely
      crawls from one extradimensional intestine to another and must endure
      another round of being swallowed whole. You still take damage from being
      cut regardless of the creature&#8217;s success. You may have four times
      the number of creatures swallowed with this ability that you normally
      could, although this does not allow you to swallow larger creatures.</p>

      <p>You can continue to use swallow whole even after a creature cuts its
      way out. When under the effects of an ability which would impede
      extradimensional travel, you lose this ability but your swallow whole or
      Tomb Of Flesh ability functions normally.</p>

      <p>If you die, the extradimensional space contracts, disgorging any
      swallowed creature into your corpse&#8217;s space.</p>
