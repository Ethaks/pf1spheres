      <p>The powers of the beyond are sufficient to appease the bound force
      within.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Spirit class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When your spirit would gain a point of
      influence over you, you may spend two uses of channel energy in place of
      allowing the spirit to gain that point of influence. In addition, when you
      would spend a use of channel energy, you may instead allow your spirit to
      gain a point of influence over you.</p>
