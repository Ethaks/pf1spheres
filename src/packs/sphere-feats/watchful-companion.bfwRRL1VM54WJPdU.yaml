      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere (Greater Summoning,
      Lingering Companion (form)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When summoned for 1 day, your companion does
      not disappear when you rest to regain spell points. When the 1 day
      duration is complete, you may pay the summoning cost again even when
      unconscious to renew the duration of the summon without your companion
      disappearing. Your companion may choose to wake you up as a free action as
      long as it is within long range.</p>
