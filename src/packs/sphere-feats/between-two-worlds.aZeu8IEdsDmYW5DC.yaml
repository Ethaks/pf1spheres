      <p>You can reverse the flow of your body&#8217;s energies, changing what
      will heal and harm you.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. You can spend a
      spell point as an immediate action to reverse your reaction to positive
      and negative energy for 1 round per necrosis feat you possess - a living
      creature would now be healed by negative energy and harmed by positive
      energy, while an undead creature would be be healed by positive energy and
      harmed by negative energy. Using this ability again while it is active
      returns you to your normal state.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> As a full-round action, you can
      reverse your reaction to positive and negative energy for 24 hours without
      spending a spell point. Using this ability again while it is active still
      returns to your normal state.</p>
