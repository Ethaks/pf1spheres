      <p>Death replenishes your magical abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Charged Spells drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever a creature within close range of you
      dies, you may spend spell points as an immediate action to replenish one
      charged spell you have cast and spent the charge of in the past within a
      number of minutes equal to your caster level. The number of spell points
      spent in this way must be equal to the number of spell points spent on the
      charged spell. The creature that dies must have a number of Hit Dice equal
      to at least half your MSB.</p>
