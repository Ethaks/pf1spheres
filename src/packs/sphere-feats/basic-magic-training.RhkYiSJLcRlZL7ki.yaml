      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> No casting class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a sphere of magic. You gain access to
      this basic sphere. You gain an effective caster level of 1, a magic skill
      bonus of 1, a magic skill defense of 12, and a spell pool of 1. You may
      also select a casting tradition when you gain this feat. You are
      considered to possess the casting class feature, but do not gain the +2
      magic talents a caster gains for their 1st level in a casting class.</p>

      <p>If you later gain levels in a class granting the casting class feature,
      exchange this feat for the Extra Magic Talent feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> For retraining purposes, having the casting
      class feature counts as Basic Magic Training.</p>
