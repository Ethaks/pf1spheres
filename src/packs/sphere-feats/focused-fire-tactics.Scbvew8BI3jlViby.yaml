      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Squadron Commander; or
      Warleader sphere, Troop Commander.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a swift action, you may spend a spell
      point or expend your martial focus and designate a target. Until the
      beginning of your next turn, whenever a member of your squadron hits that
      target, all members of your squadron receive an additional +1 circumstance
      bonus to attack rolls and damage against that target. Members with
      iterative attacks can benefit from bonuses generated earlier in the same
      turn. This bonus stacks with itself, up to a maximum equal to your War
      caster level or your ranks in Diplomacy, whichever is higher.</p>
