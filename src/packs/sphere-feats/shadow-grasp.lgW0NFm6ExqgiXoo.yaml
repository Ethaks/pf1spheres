      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Tenebrous Spell, Umbral Spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you cast a talent with the darkness
      descriptor that affects an area, creatures in the area are entangled. If
      the talent allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the entangle
      effect. If the talent does not normally allow a save, a creature can
      attempt a Reflex save (DC = the talent&#8217;s DC if it had a saving
      throw) to negate the effect. If the talent allows spell resistance,
      failing to overcome a creature&#8217;s spell resistance means it is not
      entangled. An entangled creature remains so as long as it is in the area
      of the talent and for 1 round after it leaves. A creature that leaves and
      reenters the area must attempt a new saving throw to avoid becoming
      entangled. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being entangled do
      not have to attempt additional saves if they stay within the darkened
      area. You are never impeded by the effects of your talents modified by
      this feat.</p>
