      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Circle Casting.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain access to an additional enhancement,
      which you may use normally:</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Create Proxy:</span> You may
      enhance creatures, allowing them to act as aiding casters as if they
      themselves possessed the Circle Casting feat. They do not need to have any
      magic talents or a spell pool to do so.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may incorporate Create Proxy into a spell
      as if it were an Enhancement talent. You may not take Spell Proxy if you
      have the Personal Magics drawback.</p>
