      <p>Your uncannily strong legs can send you soaring through the air.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cherufe subtype.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When calculating how high you can jump with
      your Acrobatics skill, divide your Acrobatics roll by 2 instead of 4. If
      you gain a similar ability from another source (such as the primordial
      leaper barbarian archetype), you may instead use your Acrobatics check to
      determine the height of your jump without dividing at all. This still does
      not allow you to exceed your movement for the round with the height or
      length of your jump.</p>
