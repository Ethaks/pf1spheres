      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Squadron Commander; or
      Warleader sphere, Troop Commander.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any member of your squadron may expend a
      standard action requesting assistance. You may immediately respond by
      using a sphere ability that targets them (and only them, not an area
      around them) as a free action. You must be in range, and you must be able
      to use the sphere ability. Using the sphere ability draws attacks of
      opportunity normally.</p>
