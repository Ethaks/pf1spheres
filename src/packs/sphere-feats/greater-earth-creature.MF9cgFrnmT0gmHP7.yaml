      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere (Earth Creature
      (form)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your companion gains the earth glide
      ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth Glide (Ex):</strong> When the creature burrows, it can
      pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal
      as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage,
      it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or
      hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move
      earth spell or the Forge Earth ability of the Nature spherecast on an area
      containing the burrowing creature flings it back 30 feet, stunning it for
      1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.</p>
