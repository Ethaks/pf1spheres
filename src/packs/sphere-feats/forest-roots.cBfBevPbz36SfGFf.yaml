      <p>Focusing deeply and setting yourself down into the dirt, you can use
      the woods around you to sense the world at range.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Plant type or subtype, Vegetalker.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While on a ground with soil such as the
      forest floor or swamp terrains, you can spend a full-round action that
      provokes attacks of opportunity to designate a 50 ft. radius area centered
      within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per level). You may detect objects
      within this area, as if using tremorsense. The point you designate must be
      within the same forest or swamp terrain. While using Forest Roots, you are
      denied your Dexterity bonus to armor class and cannot take a 5-foot
      step.</p>
