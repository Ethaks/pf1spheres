      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere; Focus Casting
      drawback or Galvanized drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you enhance your focus or a weapon
      you are wielding with Galvanized Casting, you may choose to have the
      effect continue without concentration without spending a spell point. This
      feat only applies to the spell point spent to relinquish concentration. If
      another feat, talent, or class feature grants you the ability to spend
      more spell points when relinquishing concentration to improve the effects,
      you still need to spend the additional spell points to gain those
      benefits.</p>
