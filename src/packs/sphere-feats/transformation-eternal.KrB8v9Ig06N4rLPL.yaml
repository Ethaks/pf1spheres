      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This functions as the Transformation feat,
      save that you may not return to your original form and must always remain
      in a form selected with the Transformation feat or a hybrid form from the
      Hybrid Transformation feat (the form selected at the time you take this
      feat, although you may change this form whenever you select a feat or
      talent that affects your transformation). Your transformation is not
      considered a magical effect and cannot be suppressed or removed by any
      effects which could suppress, remove, or override polymorph effects or
      magical effects (such as an antimagic field or the true form spell).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This counts as Transformation for the purpose
      of meeting prerequisites. Abilities that modify the Transformation feat
      (such as Improved Transformation) may also affect this feat. Whenever you
      would receive Transformation as a bonus feat, you may instead select
      Eternal Transformation.</p>
