      <p>The night is hard and the night is long, but you know deep down, you
      can brave it.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Heroic Resolve, ability to gain martial
      focus, Cha 15 or Con 15, good alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you activate heroic resolve and suppress
      a condition, you may instead suppress it for a number of rounds equal to
      the highest bonus between your Charisma or Constitution modifier.</p>

      <p>If the chosen condition originates from an evil-aligned creature or
      object or a creature or object with an evil aura or the evil sub-type, you
      may activate heroic resolve as a swift action.</p>
