      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Charged Spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use a sphere effect that you have
      prepared a charge for, you ignore any ability damage, ability drain,
      negative levels, or other effects which would penalize your caster level
      or save DCs so long as you did not have these penalties when you prepared
      the charge.</p>
