      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (one or more (sense)
      talents or abilities).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain an insight bonus to armor class
      equal to the number of senses from the Divination sphere you have active
      (maximum 1 + 1 per 5 Hit Dice). In addition, you may as an immediate
      action spend a spell point and dismiss a sense you have active to cause a
      critical hit against you to become a regular hit instead.</p>
