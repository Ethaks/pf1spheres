      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Diagram Magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one sphere of magic. For that sphere
      of magic you can prepare a reusable, portable diagram on a wearable or
      holdable items (such as a glove, tattoo, ring, or holy symbol) that you
      (and only you) can use to cast that sphere of magic without having to make
      a larger diagram for it beforehand. If the diagram is lost, torn, or
      disrupted, the caster must create a new diagram by spending 8 hours to jot
      it down on another re-usable item. You can instead create the portable
      diagram in a minute by making a concentration check (DC 20 + your magic
      skill bonus).</p>

      <p>When casting spells through your prepared diagram, you receive a +1
      competence bonus to saving throw DCs for all abilities from that sphere.
      The bonus from this feat does not stack with Sphere Focus, but counts as
      possessing Sphere Focus with the selected sphere for the purpose of
      meeting prerequisites.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may select this feat multiple times. Each
      time you do select another sphere. You may create a separate prepared
      diagram for that sphere.</p>
