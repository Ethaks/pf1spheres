      <p>Using the gifts of your fey bloodline you can hide the true nature of
      your soul.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fey type or subtype.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> By spending an immediate action, you may
      change your alignment to appear to be within one step of what it truly is
      for one minute. This changes the way your alignment interacts with spells,
      magic items, and other effects. Performing any action related to your
      actual alignment immediately ends this effect (for example, a Neutral Evil
      sidhier could use this ability to change his alignment to True Neutral to
      avoid being detected as Evil by a paladin nor targeted by the
      paladin&#8217;s smite. However, if the Neutral Evil sidhier should attack
      the paladin, his allies, an innocent or perform any other Evil act, the
      benefit of Feylignment would immediately end).</p>
