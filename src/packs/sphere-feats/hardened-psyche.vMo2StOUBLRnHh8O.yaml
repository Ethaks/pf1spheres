      <p>Your experience with violence renders you resistant to mental
      stress.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may add your Constitution score to your
      sanity score and use your Constitution modifier to determine your sanity
      threshold. In addition, you may attempt a Fortitude save in place of Will
      save against a situation which would deal sanity damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Making Sanity More Manageable:</strong> The system of sanity
      and madness is somewhat notorious for its brutality, especially against
      martial characters. If a GM feels that the sanity mechanics are
      problematically punishing as they are written, they may grant characters
      the Hardened Psyche feat for free either to all characters or to
      non-spellcaster characters (the reasoning being that exposure to the
      unnatural makes your mind more vulnerable). Alternatively or perhaps in
      addition, all characters may be granted the Desensitized feat as a bonus
      feat, reflecting how trauma makes them less vulnerable to horrific
      events.</p>
