      <p>With all your cosmic power and wisdom, you decided to form your raw and
      potent telekinetic power into the shape of a cat.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere; Mind sphere or
      Enhancement sphere (Bestow Intelligence (enhance)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> You gain a familiar, as the wizard arcane
      bond class feature. This familiar is always a cat, but may grant the
      familiar special ability from any other familiar. You treat your
      Telekinesis sphere caster level as your arcane caster level when
      determining your familiar&#8217;s abilities (to a maximum of your
      character level). Your familiar is treated as a force effect and can
      interact with incorporeal and ethereal creatures and objects as though
      they were corporeal. If you already possess a familiar, or gain one at a
      later time from another source, you may choose to have your effective
      arcane caster level from this feat stack with those from other sources (to
      a maximum of your character level). If you do not, you may not manifest
      your telekinetic cat while in the possession of another familiar.</p>

      <p>Unlike other familiars, this familiar is directly manifested by your
      telekinetic magic, and as such, is limited to your Telekinesis sphere
      range. If your familiar leaves this range, it is immediately dismissed. If
      your familiar is dismissed (either by being dispelled, walking outside
      your Telekinesis sphere range, etc.), you may resummon your familiar by
      spending 1 minute in meditation. If your familiar is dead, you may
      resummon your familiar whenever you would rest and regain resources.</p>
