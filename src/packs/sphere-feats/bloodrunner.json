You ignore any detriment from traversing on bloody terrain, such as difficult terrain or the terrain being considered slippery (as long as blood is the only reason that terrain is detrimental), and you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against bleed effects and any effect from the Blood sphere. You can distinctly tell the difference between the blood of any two creatures, and can identify the blood of creatures you have witnessed before. You can attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature by merely witnessing its blood, as if you had seen the creature by sight, but only if the blood was shed within an hour of you attempting to identify it.</p>\n",
