      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Transformation, customized weapons
      class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may assign each form you can take
      (including your base form) to a specific customized weapon you possess.
      You may reassign these forms whenever you gain an additional customized
      weapon, a new instance of the Transformation feat, or a feat with
      Transformation as a prerequisite. When you swap to that specific
      customized weapon, you may swap to the corresponding form as part of the
      same action. This does not require the form you are currently in to be
      able to draw or use the customized weapon you are swapping to.</p>
