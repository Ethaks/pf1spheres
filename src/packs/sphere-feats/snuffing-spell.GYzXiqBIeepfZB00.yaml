    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can modify a talent to extinguish magical
      and non-magical light sources that the target has. The first time a
      creature takes damage from or fails a saving throw against a snuffing
      talent, any non-magical light sources it has are immediately extinguished
      and you can attempt to dispel any active sphere effects with the light
      descriptor that are affecting the target as if you had also cast the
      targeted version of Counterspell (as the feat). Talents that do not target
      creatures cannot be snuffing talents.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>
