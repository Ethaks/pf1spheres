    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any talent you cast with the light descriptor
      that deals damage (including the Light sphere&#8217;s Searing Light talent
      and any blast type in the Destruction sphere&#8217;s Light blast type
      group) is fortified with the cleansing energies of the sun. If the talent
      creates an area of light, all creatures are dazzled for as long as they
      remain within the light&#8217;s area. Oozes, fungal creatures, creatures
      from the Shadow Plane, and undead must also succeed at a Will save (normal
      DC for your talent) or take a &#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls, damage
      rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for as long as they
      remain within the light&#8217;s area. If the talent normally dazzles or
      blinds affected creatures with a duration other than instantaneous or
      permanent, the duration of that effect is increased by a number of rounds
      equal to 1/2 the talent&#8217;s caster level (minimum 1 round). Saving
      throws to remove the effect early still apply and can bypass this
      increase. If the talent deals more damage against oozes, fungal creatures,
      creatures from the Shadow Plane, or undead with a specific vulnerability
      to sunlight, the talent deals 1 additional point of damage per die against
      such creatures. If the damaging effect does not deal damage based on dice,
      it instead deals 1 additional point of damage per caster level.</p>
