      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature, base attack
      bonus +6.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When making a full attack, you may spend a
      spell point to replace the first attack with any sphere ability or
      supernatural ability that can be used as a standard action and requires an
      attack roll or touch attack roll. You must still pay any costs required by
      this sphere ability or supernatural ability (such as spell points), and if
      you are using two weapons, this replaces both the primary and secondary
      weapon attacks. Abilities that replace any of your attacks in a full-round
      attack are not compatible with mystic assault, nor are other abilities
      that allow you to use a supernatural or sphere ability as part of an
      attack.</p>

      <p>Using the sphere or supernatural ability provokes an attack of
      opportunity if it normally would, and if the ability is disrupted, the
      associated attack is lost but the remaining iterative attacks are not. You
      may decide after you have used your sphere or supernatural ability whether
      to spend the spell point and continue with your full-round attack or if
      you wish to take a move action instead.</p>
