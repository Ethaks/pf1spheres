      <p>Your magic is not troubled by the endeavors of the weak.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Magic skill bonus +10.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever a finishing spell targets a creature
      whose remaining hit points are less than 4 x the caster level of the
      effect, that creature takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against the
      effect. This penalty increases to -4 if the creature&#8217;s remaining hit
      points are less than 2 x the caster level of the effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>
