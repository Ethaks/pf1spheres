      <p>You are the bane of those who believe they stand atop the world.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Con 15, Giantslayer, base attack bonus
      +10.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The bonus granted by your Giantslayer feat
      when performing or resisting a combat maneuver against a foe who is at
      least 1 size category larger than yourself increases to +2 per size
      category larger than yourself the opponent is. In addition, you can now
      use combat maneuvers against targets 2 size categories larger than would
      normally be allowed (instead of just 1 size category as allowed by the
      Giantslayer feat).</p>
