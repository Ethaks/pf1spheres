      <p>You didn&#8217;t see anything wrong with calling your mother
      &#8220;maw&#8221;, but everyone always looked concerned about calling your
      father &#8220;paw&#8221;, given his&#8230; paws.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> You count as both your current race and as a
      catfolk for any effects related to race; such as taking traits, feats, how
      spells and magic items affect you, qualifying for archetypes, and so
      on.</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain one of the following feline abilities. Once
      chosen, this cannot be changed.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Cat&#8217;s Eyes:</strong> You gain low-light vision and a +2
      bonus on Perception checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception,
      this bonus increases to +4.</li>

      <li><strong>Cat&#8217;s Meow:</strong> You gain the ability to speak with
      cats, as though under a constant Nature sphere Speak With Wildlife effect
      as an extraordinary ability. This only grants the ability to speak with
      cats (of any kind, e.g. house cats, lions, etc.), not all animals.</li>

      <li><strong>Deft Paws and Tricky Tail:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus on
      Sleight of Hand checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Sleight of Hand,
      this bonus increases to +4. In addition, you gain a tail (if you did not
      already have one), and may use your tail as though it were a free hand for
      the purposes of performing disarm and steal combat maneuvers and Sleight
      of Hand checks. You may hold and retrieve objects with this tail but
      cannot manipulate a held object or wield weapons with your tail unless you
      could with another ability.</li>

      <li><strong>Quick Steps:</strong> You gain a +10 feet bonus to your base
      land speed.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>When you gain this feat, you may decide if your chosen feline abilities
      cause you to gain subtle (or obvious) cat-like features, such as cat eyes,
      whiskers and a &#8220;nya&#8221;-ccent, paws, or a tail. These changes are
      purely cosmetic unless otherwise mentioned. You may choose to suppress or
      resume these cat-like features as a free action.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You can take this feat a second time. If you
      do, you gain the other three feline abilities you did not originally
      choose.</p>
