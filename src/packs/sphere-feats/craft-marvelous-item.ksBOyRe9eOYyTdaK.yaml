      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> A marvelous item is a device that produces a
      magical effect that must be activated (usually activated as a standard
      action) often through the touch of a button, the speaking of a command
      word, or some other action such as striking the item against the ground,
      holding it against the intended target, throwing the item through the air.
      Marvelous items use the talent-based method of magic item creation. If a
      wondrous item&#8217;s effect requires a saving throw from any creature,
      the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the item&#8217;s caster level.</p>

      <p>A marvelous item can be used once per day by default, and costs 400 gp
      x caster level x complexity. Additionally, a marvelous item can possess
      the following custom multipliers.</p>

      <p><strong>Multiple Uses:</strong> If a marvelous item can be used
      multiple times per day, multiply the cost by the number of daily uses. If
      its uses per day is increased to 5, it becomes usable an unlimited number
      of times per day.</p>

      <p><strong>Limited Uses:</strong> If a marvelous item can be used at will
      but only a maximum of 50 times before it loses all of its magic, multiply
      its cost by 2.5.</p>
