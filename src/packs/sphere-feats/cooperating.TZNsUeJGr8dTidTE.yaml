      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Any one teamwork feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Whenever you begin using the cooperating
      purr, choose one teamwork feat you possess. While using the cooperating
      purr, whenever an ally begins their turn within your purring aura, that
      ally gains the chosen teamwork feat for 1 round. You may share a teamwork
      feat this way even if your allies could not normally qualify for it.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> Whenever you begin using the
      cooperating purr, instead of choosing a teamwork feat you possess, you may
      instead use any teamwork feat you meet the prerequisites for, temporarily
      gaining that teamwork feat as a bonus feat and granting it to allies which
      begin their turn within your purring aura. You may choose a different
      teamwork feat to temporarily gain each time you begin using the
      cooperating purr.</p>
