      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may exchange one or more traits granted
      by Improved Transformation for any other traits you would qualify for
      whenever you consume a creature&#8217;s brain. These traits must emulate
      abilities that the consumed creature possessed or that are associated with
      the creature, subject to GM discretion.</p>
