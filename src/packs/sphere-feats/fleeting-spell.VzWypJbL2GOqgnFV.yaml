      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A fleeting talent&#8217;s duration becomes
      dismissible, if it is not already. You can dismiss your own fleeting
      talent as a swift action. When you dismiss a fleeting talent, its
      lingering aura cannot be detected by magic unless the caster succeeds at a
      magic skill check against a DC equal to 11 + 1/2 your caster level
      (minimum 1). The DC of checks to counter a fleeting spell is reduced by 2,
      and once active, counterspell removes a fleeting spell without a magic
      skill check. A fleeting talent has half its normal duration (with an
      extended fleeting talent, these duration adjustments cancel out). Only
      talents with a duration of at least 2 rounds can be made fleeting, and
      instantaneous or permanent talents cannot be fleeting talents. Time spent
      concentrating on a talent does not count against a fleeting talent&#8217;s
      time limit, and you may choose to activate this metamagic when spending a
      spell point to make a talent you are concentrating on last without
      concentration.</p>
