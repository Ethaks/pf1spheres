      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> A creature with the Distill Compound feat is
      adept at creating compounds including potions, oils, and powders.
      Compounds are magical effects stored in physical form; they use the
      talent-based method of item creation, and are usable only once.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>A potion targets the creature who drinks it, usually as a standard
      action (one target with a range of personal).</li>

      <li>An oil may be applied to an object or creature within your reach as a
      standard action. For unwilling targets this requires a melee touch attack
      that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You may attempt to apply
      an oil to a target at range, treating the oil as a splash weapon that only
      affects the target of a direct hit. Additionally, if the oil affects
      creatures but not objects, you may use the oil as a contact poison such as
      by applying it to a weapon.</li>

      <li>An effect that targets an area can be made into a powder. A powder may
      be thrown as a splash weapon (centering itself on the square it strikes),
      or may be spread by hand (centering the effect anywhere between directly
      on the user and far enough away so the area of effect borders the
      user&#8217;s space).</li>

      <li>With GM permission, it is also possible to place a compound-like
      effect into a different, appropriate item (for example, a jewel that
      explodes when thrown or an apple that applies a potion-like effect when
      eaten, etc.).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A compound has a base cost of 50 gp x caster level x complexity. If a
      compound requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 its caster
      level.</p>
