      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (cohort) package,
      bard song or raging song class feature.</p>

      <p>When you begin a bard song or raging song, you may pass it off to a
      cohort within 30 feet as a free action. The cohort may maintain the
      performance as a standard action each round, spending your rounds of
      performance normally to do so. You may initiate a performance while
      another one is being maintained by your cohort, though multiple instances
      of the same performance do not stack.</p>
