      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Counterspell or the ability to cast
      dispel magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you successfully counterspell a spell or
      sphere effect, the caster suffers a 50% increase in wild magic chance
      until the end of its next turn. This penalty increases by 10% per wild
      magic feat you possess, to a maximum of 100%. Additionally, you gain a +1
      bonus to your MSB when counterspelling. The affected caster is not aware
      of this increase.</p>
