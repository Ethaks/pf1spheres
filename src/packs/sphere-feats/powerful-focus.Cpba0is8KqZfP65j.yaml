      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mental Focus.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can expend your mental focus as part of
      casting a sphere effect to increase the saving throw DC by a +1 competence
      bonus. A sphere effect that does not require a saving throw to resist or
      lessen the effect cannot be used with this feat.</p>
