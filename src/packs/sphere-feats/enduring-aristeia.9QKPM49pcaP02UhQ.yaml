    value: >
      <p>Regardless of the toll it takes, you hold on to your power until the
      duty is done.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add five times the number of Aristeia feats
      you possess to your Constitution score for the purpose of determining the
      number of negative hit points at which you die. When your Aristeia would
      end, you may add an additional round to your Aristeia. If you do, you
      immediately suffer a permanent negative level. You may continue to use
      this feat until the total number of negative levels you would be affected
      by upon the end of your Aristeia would equal your character level.
      Negative levels gained from this feat cannot be negated through condition
      negation.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Endurance for the purpose
      of meeting prerequisites.</p>
