      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Craft Spell Engine, caster level
      4th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When recharging a spell engine, you may spend
      a number of spell points not exceeding half your caster level, restoring
      an equal number of spell points to the spell engine.</p>

      <p>You may not exceed the spell engine&#8217;s maximum charges this way.
      You may recharge a spell engine more than once a day with this ability,
      but the total transferred spell points cannot exceed half your caster
      level. Additionally, you may count your caster level as 4 higher when
      determining what spell engines you can recharge.</p>
