      <p>You may bind yourself to an oncoming spell at great risk.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Guardian sphere (Cold Iron Call, Defend
      Other), Counterspell, Counterspell Mastery, magic skill bonus +7.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When counterspelling an effect that would
      affect you and only you, you may roll twice and take the higher result on
      the magic skill check to counterspell. If you fail, you take a -2 penalty
      on your AC, spell resistance, and saving throws against the effect. When
      using Defend Other to redirect a spell from an ally to yourself, you may
      spend 2 spell points to attempt to Counterspell the effect as part of the
      action to use Defend Other.</p>
