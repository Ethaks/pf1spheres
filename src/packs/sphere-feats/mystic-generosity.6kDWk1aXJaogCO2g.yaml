      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Circle Casting,
      Spell Proxy.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you use Create Proxy on a creature,
      you may spend a spell point to grant them the Basic Magic Training feat as
      a bonus feat while they are under the effects of that enhancement. The
      sphere they gain access to must be one that you also have access to.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If the target of Create Proxy does not meet
      the prerequisites for Basic Magic Training, they gain Extra Magic Talent
      as a bonus feat instead. The bonus talent they gain must be one that you
      also possess.</p>
