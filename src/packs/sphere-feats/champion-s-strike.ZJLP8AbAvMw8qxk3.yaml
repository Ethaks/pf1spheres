      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Arcane Strike or Imbued Strike.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your arcane strike or imbued strike is in
      effect at all times without you needing to take an action to activate it.
      In addition, when you use this ability with an attack action that only
      affects one target and has only one attack roll, the bonus on damage rolls
      for your strike is increased 100% for every +5 base attack bonus you
      possess.</p>
