      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Guardian sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When your delayed damage pool empties, you
      may as an immediate action redirect the damage you would take to augment
      or implant on your person or an innate gadget. The damage redirected this
      way is treated as untyped lethal damage, bypassing any damage reduction or
      hardness the augment or implant would possess otherwise.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This overrides the normal rules for the
      delayed damage pool which states that you cannot further redirect damage
      from the delayed damage pool.</p>
