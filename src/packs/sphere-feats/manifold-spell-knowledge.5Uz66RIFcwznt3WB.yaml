      <p>You know of multiple ways to utilize your magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Caster level 1st or higher with at least
      two casting traditions.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may pool your magic spheres and talents
      between two of your casting traditions, allowing you to select which
      casting tradition you use each of your magic talents with when you cast
      them. Any magic effects created with a casting tradition other than the
      original tradition it was selected with costs 1 additional spell point (or
      1 spell point if it would not cost spell points). You cannot use this feat
      with the two talents you gain at 1st level for being a caster or with any
      talents gained through sphere-specific drawbacks. Add your caster levels
      from the two casting traditions together rather than determining them
      separately. For example, a 5th-level incanter with this feat who used two
      levels to advance in the Blood Magic tradition and three levels to advance
      in the Runist tradition would have a caster level of 5 for both traditions
      rather than a caster level of 2 when using Blood Magic and a caster level
      of 3 when using Runist magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat multiple times, each
      time adding magic spheres and talents from an additional casting tradition
      to the pool.</p>
