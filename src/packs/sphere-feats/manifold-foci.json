      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Center Of Power or Focus Casting.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You possess multiple foci or multiple centers of power, to a maximum of your casting ability modifier. You may use any of these focuses to cast if you have the Focus Casting drawback and are not dazed by having your Center Of Power targeted unless all of your other centers of power have been struck by attacks since you last regained spell points. However, you take a -1 penalty to your caster level for each of foci or centers of power that has been damaged since you last regained spell points. This penalty is reduced by 1 whenever you repair one of your foci or receive healing which equals or exceeds your MSD (in which case you choose one of your centers of power to no longer be considered damaged). For every undamaged focus or center of power you are using beyond the first, you gain a +1 bonus on concentration checks made to cast defensively.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Combat Casting for the purposes of meeting other prerequisites that depend on it. This feat&#8217;s benefits to concentration checks do not stack with Combat Casting.</p>\n",
