      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Must have been subject to the Fusion
      advanced talent, character level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When under the effects of the Fusion advanced
      talent with another creature that possesses this feat, you may act
      together more efficiently. You may choose to cooperate, allowing each
      creature to use the body to take a standard action. This consumes the
      amalgamated body&#8217;s full-round action, but leaves each mind with
      their normal move and swift actions.</p>

      <p>This allows both creatures to supply verbal or somatic spell
      components, allows either creature to make attacks of opportunity, grants
      each creature access to combat feats and combat talents known by the
      other, and allows you to choose which mind is targeted by effects
      requiring a Will save until the start of your next turn.</p>
