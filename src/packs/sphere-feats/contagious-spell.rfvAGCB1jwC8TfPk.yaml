      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can apply this effect only to targeted
      talents that are harmful to their target and do not have a range of
      personal; a contagious talent never spreads to someone who would benefit
      from being the target of the talent.</p>

      <p>A magic skill check to dispel or remove a contagious talent that fails
      by 5 or more causes it to spread from the original target to the creature
      that attempted to remove it. The talent spreads to the new target
      regardless of its normal range or any special targeting requirement like a
      melee or ranged touch attack. The talent is treated as if you had just
      cast it on the new target. The new target receives a saving throw or the
      benefit of spell resistance (if applicable) if the talent normally allows
      it.</p>
