      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Acrobatics 3 ranks, Telekinesis
      sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> By applying your telekinetic powers to your
      own body you can stand on surfaces that could not normally support your
      weight, allowing you to balance on a single thread or walk across liquid,
      though you must still attempt Acrobatics checks to balance on narrow or
      difficult surfaces. You cannot walk on normal gaseous substances such as
      air or clouds, though you could balance on a solid fog spell. In addition,
      you may add your casting ability modifier as a bonus to Acrobatics
      checks.</p>
