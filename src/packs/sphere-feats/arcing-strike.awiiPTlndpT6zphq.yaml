      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Guided Strike
      (blast shape)), caster level 11th.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to make your destructive blast fly in an
      erratic path, unerringly striking your target no matter what lies between
      you. Your destructive blast ignores the AC bonus granted to targets by
      anything less than total cover, and the miss chance granted to targets by
      anything less than total concealment. Total cover and total concealment
      provide their normal benefits against your ranged attacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Divination sphere Viewing
      talent, you can use Arcing Strike to strike any target that you can see
      that is within range of both your destructive blast and your divination,
      as long as it is not inside a completely enclosed space (GM&#8217;s
      discretion).</p>
