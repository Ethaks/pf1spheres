      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A consecrated talent is treated as a
      maximized talent against evil creatures and creatures with the evil
      subtype. Against all other creatures, this feat does not modify the spell
      in any way (for example, a consecrated destructive blast acts as a normal
      destructive blast against neutral or good creatures). This feat does not
      stack with Maximize Spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +2 spell points</p>
