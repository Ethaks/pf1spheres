      <p>Your charged spells can react violently to interlopers.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Charged Spells drawback, Bottled
      Spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you imbue a consumable item with a
      charged sphere ability using Bottled Spells, you may choose to have the
      item target any creature which attempts to use the item rather than
      granting the ability to use the sphere ability. If the sphere ability in
      the item would normally require an attack roll, the sphere effect is
      considered to hit automatically when the target tries to use the item.</p>
