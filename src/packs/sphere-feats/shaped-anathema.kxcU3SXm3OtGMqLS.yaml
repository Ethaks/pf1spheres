      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Anathema.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may form your anathema in different
      shapes, affecting all creatures within the area. You may make a line with
      a length equal to the range of your anathema, a cone with a length equal
      to 1/2 the range of your anathema, or a burst around yourself with a
      radius equal to 1/3 the range of your anathema. Any creature within other
      than yourself takes damage, with a Reflex save for half damage with a DC
      equal to 10 + the number of dice of damage your anathema does (not
      including extra dice from focused anathema) + your highest mental
      attribute modifier.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Extended Anathema feat, the size of these shapes
      increases as your range does.</p>
