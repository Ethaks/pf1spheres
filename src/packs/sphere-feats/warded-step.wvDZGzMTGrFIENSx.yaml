      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Casting class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your sphere effects that cover an area
      (including darknesses, totems, and wards) are especially easy for you to
      move through. The area inside one of your sphere effects is never
      difficult terrain for you, and you receive a +4 circumstance bonus to AC
      vs. attacks of opportunity caused by moving through any square of a sphere
      effect you created.</p>
