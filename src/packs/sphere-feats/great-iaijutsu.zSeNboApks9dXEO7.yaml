      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere (Iai Slash (bleed)),
      base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When utilizing your Iai Slash talent, you may
      expend your martial focus to additionally apply the effects of one (bleed)
      talent other than Iai Slash to a single creature struck as part of the
      talent. If you have more than one martial focus, you may expend two
      martial focuses to instead apply that (bleed) talent to all creatures
      struck.</p>
