      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Counterspell.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you use Counterspell, you may end an
      enhancement affecting yourself to increase the number of magical effects
      you may end with Counterspell by one. There is no limit on the number of
      enhancements you may cancel to improve your Counterspell; however, you may
      only use enhancements you created yourself to fuel this feat that are not
      maintained through concentration.</p>
