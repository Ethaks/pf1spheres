      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weather sphere (any (shroud) talent),
      magic skill bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When a creature is under the effect of
      shrouds produced by multiple casters with this feat, any saving throws
      against one of these shrouds is made against the highest DC of any such
      shroud. Shrouds produced by casters without this feat are unaffected and
      other shrouds cannot use their DC.</p>
