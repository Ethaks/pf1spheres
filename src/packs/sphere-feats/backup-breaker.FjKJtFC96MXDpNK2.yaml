      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Boxing sphere, Dual Wielding
      sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you ready a counter punch to make a dual
      attack, you may make only the attack with your primary or off-hand weapon
      when your counter punch is triggered. If you do, you may make your other
      attack when another creature would perform an action that would trigger
      your counter punch before the start of your next turn. You may only apply
      a (counter) talent to one of these attacks made as part of this counter
      punch. The bonus damage from a counter punch is applied to both attacks.
      These counter punches count as attacks in a dual attack for the purposes
      of Dual Wielding talents.</p>
