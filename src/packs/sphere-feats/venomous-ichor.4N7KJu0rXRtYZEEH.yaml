      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere (Serpentine
      Transformation (transformation) or Vermin Transformation
      (transformation)), poison bestial trait, or racial poison ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any creature that confirms a critical hit
      against you with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed with your
      poison (treat the poison as a contact poison for this application). Melee
      weapons with reach do not endanger their users in this way. You cannot use
      this ability if you do not have poison.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can apply your poison to a weapon or natural attack
      by dipping it in your own blood as a swift action. This requires dealing
      1d4 damage to yourself as part of the swift action unless you suffer from
      an ongoing bleed effect or are below half your maximum hit points. This is
      an extraordinary (Ex) ability.</p>
