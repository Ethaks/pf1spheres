      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Witchmarked drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a full-round action, you may conceal your
      witchmark for 24 hours without the need for a Disguise check. You may even
      attempt to use magic without giving away your witchmark, but in order to
      do so you must attempt a concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 the caster
      level). On a failure you may choose to either manifest your witchmark or
      keep your witchmark hidden but have no magical effect manifest, wasting
      any time and spell points spent. You may choose to re-manifest your
      witchmark as a free action.</p>
