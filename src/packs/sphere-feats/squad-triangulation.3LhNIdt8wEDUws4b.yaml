      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Squadron Commander; or
      Warleader sphere, Troop Commander.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You always know the position of members of
      your squad relative to yourself even if you cannot see or hear them.
      Members of your squad are always aware of your position and each
      others&#8217; positions in a similar manner. In addition, you are treated
      as having line of sight on all members of your squadron at all times but
      increase the action necessary to affect creatures you cannot directly see
      with your Squadron feat abilities by one step.</p>
