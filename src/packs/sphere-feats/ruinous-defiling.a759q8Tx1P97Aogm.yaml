      <p>Your despoilation inflicts pain on those caught in your path.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Terrain Casting drawback, non-good
      alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you blight, corrupt, or drain an
      area of its nutrients with the Terrain Casting drawback, you may choose to
      damage all creatures caught inside the defiled area. Creatures other than
      yourself inside the corrupted area take 1 point of negative energy damage
      per caster level (Will save negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your character level +
      your casting ability modifier). This damage does not heal creatures which
      would be healed by negative energy.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Defiler Feats:</strong> The damage from this feat
      increases to 2 points of negative energy per caster level.</p>
