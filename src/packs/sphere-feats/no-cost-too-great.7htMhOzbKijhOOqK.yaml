      <p>Success sometimes necessitates losing more than you bargained for.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Draining Casting (drawback) or
      Unsettling Casting (drawback).</p>

      take. If you do, you gain a +1 competence bonus to your caster level on
      the effect. You must take damage or sanity damage from Draining Casting or
      Unsettling casting with the sphere effect to use this feat.</p>
