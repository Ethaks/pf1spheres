      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> A character who possesses this feat can
      create scrolls. In addition to ritual scrolls (which function the same as
      scrolls from the core Pathfinder Roleplaying Game), they can create
      scrolls using the talent-based item creation system. Scrolls have the same
      requirements for deciphering and activating as core Pathfinder scrolls,
      and a creature must possess a scroll&#8217;s base sphere, or else must
      activate the scroll through the Use Magic Device skill.</p>

      <p>A scroll has a base cost of 25 gp x caster level x complexity.</p>
