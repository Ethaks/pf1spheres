      <p>Your abilities and commitments have been recognized by immortal
      features.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Outsider with the native subtype,
      alignment matching either an extraplanar ancestor or a patron.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You lose the native subtype, no longer aging
      or requiring food but becoming incapable of being resurrected by normal
      means. You no longer gain bonuses or suffer penalties from advancing in
      age, although you retain any bonuses and penalties you may already possess
      from your age. If you are the descendant of or patroned by an outsider
      with an alignment or elemental subtype (such as good, chaotic, fire, or
      earth), you gain these subtypes. Patronage in this context refers to a
      being that you gain class features from (such as cleric gaining domains or
      a thaumaturge gaining benefits from a pact). Gods should generally be
      considered outsiders with subtypes corresponding to their alignment for
      the purposes of this feat.</p>
