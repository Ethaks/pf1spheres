      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Combat Stamina.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you create a totem or mandate, you may
      spend a stamina point each round to maintain it as a free action. You are
      still considered concentrating and can have your concentration disrupted
      as usual. You may maintain multiple effects this way. You can not recover
      the stamina points spent while the totem or mandate maintained this way
      remains in effect.</p>
