      <p>You channel the elements through decisive strikes and furtive
      determination.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ability to maintain martial focus, base
      attack bonus +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you make an attack action or attack
      of opportunity, you may expend your martial focus and choose acid, cold,
      electricity, or fire. If you do, your attack deals additional energy
      damage of the chosen type equal to 1d6 + your base attack bonus.</p>

      <p>Whenever you perform an attack action and expend martial focus to deal
      additional damage with a combat sphere ability (such as with Berserker
      sphere&#8217;s brutal strike or Fencing sphere&#8217;s fatal thrust
      precision damage modified with the Skewer talent), you may choose to have
      the additional damage be dealt as acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage,
      chosen when performing the attack action.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Fencing sphere fatal thrust damage is still
      precision damage, even if it would be dealt as energy damage rather than
      physical damage. Other attack action additional damage is likewise subject
      to any targeting restrictions or immunities a target might possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Elemental Might is treated as the Elemental
      Fist feat (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Player&#8217;s Guide) for
      the purposes of prerequisites. You treat maintaining martial focus as
      having 1 or more uses of the Elemental Fist feat; if an ability or effect
      would allow you to expend 1 or more uses of the Elemental Fist feat, you
      may expend your martial focus instead. Whenever you expend martial focus
      to deal energy damage with this feat (either with this feat or by
      converting an attack action&#8217;s additional damage), this damage is
      treated as damage dealt by the Elemental Fist feat for the purposes of
      other abilities and effects.</p>
