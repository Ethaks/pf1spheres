      <p>Attack smarter, not harder.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Int 13, Focused Shot, Point-Blank Shot,
      Precise Shot.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may use Focused Shot with any ranged
      weapon, not just bows or crossbows. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and
      damage rolls when using Focused Shot. If using Spheres of Might, this
      counts as a special attack action.</p>
