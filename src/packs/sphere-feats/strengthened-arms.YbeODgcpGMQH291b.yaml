      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Secondary arms racial trait.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your secondary arms are as powerful as
      regular arms. You may use your secondary arms to hold shields, fulfill
      somatic requirements, or make attacks (although this does not grant you
      additional attacks or actions per round). When wielding a weapon in two
      hands, add 1.5 times your Strength modifier to damage instead of 1 or .5
      times your Strength modifier. When wielding a weapon in all 4 hands, add 2
      times your Strength modifier to damage instead of 1.5 times your Strength
      modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Taking this feat qualifies a tatulani to take
      the Unreasonable Coordination feat.</p>
