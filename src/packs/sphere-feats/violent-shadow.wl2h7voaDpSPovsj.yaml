      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Shadowmark 3d6, shadow pool.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may spend a shadow point as a full-round
      action to make a single attack with your shadowmark. Rather than a ranged
      touch attack, treat your shadowmark as a melee touch attack with a 10-foot
      reach. Regardless of if your attack hits or not, you may make attacks of
      opportunity as melee touch attacks with a 10-foot reach with your
      shadowmark without additional expenditure of points from your shadow pool
      until the beginning of your next turn. If you have multiple attacks from a
      high base attack bonus or effects such as haste you can (as part of the
      full-round action) make as many attacks with your violent shadow as your
      base attack bonus allows.</p>
