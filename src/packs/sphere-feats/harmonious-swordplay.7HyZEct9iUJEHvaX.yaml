      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dual Wielding sphere, Improved Unarmed
      Strike.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> As long as you have martial focus, dual
      attacks made with a manufactured weapon and an unarmed strike remove the
      attack penalty from dual attack for one manufactured weapon (as long as it
      is not being treated as an unarmed strike), and any unarmed strikes add
      your full Strength bonus to damage rolls instead of half for an off-hand
      attack.</p>
