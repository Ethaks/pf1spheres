      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Due to some quirk of your consciousness or
      oddity in your background, your heart and mind are like that of another
      realm entirely. Scrying to locate your Dreamscape now treats your
      Dreamscape as if it is on another Plane rather than on the same Plane as
      your physical form, granting a +5 bonus to your Will save to avoid the
      scrying attempt. In addition, any effect that numerically boosts the
      difficulty of getting into your Dreamscape or moving within it is
      increased by 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> There will usually be some actual world or realm
      in a campaign&#8217;s cosmology connected to this feat when it is taken.
      People within that world or realm, or others who also have the
      Otherworldly Mind feat connected to that realm, ignore your
      Dreamscape&#8217;s extra +5 bonus.</p>
