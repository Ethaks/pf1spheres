      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can modify a talent to daze a creature
      damaged by it. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become
      dazed for a number of rounds equal to half the caster level of the talent
      (minimum 1). If the talent allows a saving throw, a successful save
      negates the daze effect.</p>

      <p>If the talent does not allow a save, the target can attempt a Will save
      to negate the daze effect. If the talent effect also causes the creature
      to become dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the
      duration of the spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +3 spell points</p>
