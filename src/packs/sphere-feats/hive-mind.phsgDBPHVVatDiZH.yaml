      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Squadron Commander; or
      Warleader sphere, Troop Commander; caster level 5th or 5 ranks in
      Diplomacy.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain the ability to communicate
      telepathically with all members of your squadron regardless of range,
      allowing you to send messages and for them to send their own. In addition,
      you do not need to touch members of your squadron in order to renew your
      bond with them; they need only be in telepathic contact with you when you
      take a minute to renew your bond. So long as at least one member of your
      squadron is aware of a threat, all members are aware of the threat and
      cannot be flanked by threats that others are aware of. Such awareness can
      spread along a &#8220;chain&#8221; of creatures under appropriate
      circumstances, potentially alerting distant creatures.</p>
