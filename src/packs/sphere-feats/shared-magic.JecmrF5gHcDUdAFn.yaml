      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you use a sphere ability that has an
      ongoing effect, you may spend a free action to designate an ally within
      close range as the owner of the ability. That ally gains control of the
      ability at the beginning of their next turn. The new owner is considered
      the creator of the spell, and can do whatever the owner can with the
      spell, including concentrating to maintain it, dismissing it, moving it
      (if it can be moved), spending spell points on it, or any other effect
      that can take place after the ability has been created. The new owner must
      be a spherecaster with a caster level equal to a minimum of half the
      caster level of the sphere ability the are being given. They use their own
      concentration and magical skill bonus to maintain the spell, but the
      sphere ability still uses your caster level.</p>
