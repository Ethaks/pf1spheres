      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Shield sphere, Improved Unarmed
      Strike.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As long as you have one hand free, your free
      hand is considered to be a shield for the purposes of using active defense
      and talents that augment active defense. Talents that require you to be
      wielding a shield or have a shield equipped such as Deflecting Shield,
      Hardened Shield and Shield Skate do not gain the benefits of this
      talent.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the talents you possess within the Shield sphere count
      towards your unarmed damage progression.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This feat does not allow you to perform
      shield bashes with a free hand or unarmed strike.</p>
