    value: >
      <p>Your magic naturally bonds to the overflowing power of ley lines,
      granting you strength even in regions your magic would not flourish.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Area Bound drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may bond to a ley line with your Area
      Bound casting tradition drawback even if the ley line&#8217;s location is
      not the same type of location you would normally bond to (bonding to a ley
      line does not automatically attune you to the ley line).</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain a bonus on Spellcraft checks made to attune to a
      ley line equal to 1/2 your magic skill bonus (minimum 1). You may treat
      any ley line you have successfully attuned to as a bonded area for the
      Area Bound general casting drawback, allowing your magic to work normally
      within a number of miles of the ley line even if you are bound to another
      location. Normal: The Area Bound general casting drawback restricts the
      caster to a specific type of location when forming a bond with a new
      area.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This drawback is not useful or appropriate in
      games without ley lines. A character interested in this drawback feat
      should speak with their GM before selecting this feat.</p>
