      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Extended Casting
      drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your slow casting style results in more
      firmly constructed sphere effects. You add your casting ability modifier
      as a bonus to your MSD (minimum +1) for the purposes of countering or
      dispelling your sphere effects. You may spend an additional spell point
      when enhancing a creature or object to force any creature attempting to
      dispel or counter that effect to roll twice and take the worse result.</p>
