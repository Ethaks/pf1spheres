      <p>Your protective might is delivered on the swift heels of your
      mount.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Beastmastery sphere or animal companion
      class feature, Guardian sphere ((patrol) package).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> While mounted, you may use your mount&#8217;s
      movement whenever you could move as part of your patrol, provided your
      mount&#8217;s total movement before its next turn does not exceed its base
      speed. Any movement you or your mount make provoke attacks of opportunity
      as normal. In addition, whenever you could make an attack of opportunity
      as part of your patrol, you may have your mount make an attack of
      opportunity against that target instead.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> You cannot move with your mount as part of
      your patrol.</p>
