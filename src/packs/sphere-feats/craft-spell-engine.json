      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> This feat allows a creature to create spell-trigger items which casters can use as if they were their own sphere abilities. A creature must possess a spell engine&#8217;s base sphere, or else must activate the spell engine through the Use Magic Device skill.</p>\n<p>The most common form of spell engine is a wand; a handheld stick usually between 5 and 12 inches long that the caster points to direct the magic. However, a spell engine can take any form.</p>\n<p>A spell engine contains a limited amount of casting ability, which can be activated by the one wielding the spell engine as a standard action, as if the magic were their own. A spell engine possesses a base sphere, a caster level, and a small pool of spell points. The spell engine uses its own caster level and spell points to fuel its casting ability; under normal circumstances, a caster cannot spend their own spell points or use their own caster level when activating a spell engine. If a spell engine&#8217;s effects call for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the item&#8217;s caster level.</p>\n<p>Once per day, a caster whose caster level is at least equal to the spell engine&#8217;s caster level may spend one of their spell points to restore 1 spell point to the spell engine. A spell engine may only have one spell point per day restored in this fashion, regardless of how many casters attempt to do so.</p>\n<p>The simplest spell engine a crafter may create contains a base sphere, 1 spell point, and a caster level of 2. This spell engine has a base price of 1,000 gp. When a crafter increases a spell engine&#8217;s caster level (to a maximum of their own), for every 2 caster levels a spell engine gains, the crafter may place an additional magic talent into the spell engine, or may increase the spell engine&#8217;s maximum spell point pool by 1. A crafter must possess each talent to be placed in the spell engine, or else must have access to that talent through another caster. Likewise, if a crafter possesses a sphere-specific drawback for the spell engine&#8217;s base sphere (or simply wants to create a focused spell engine), that spell engine also possesses that sphere-specific drawback, and gains either a bonus magic talent or a spell point in exchange.</p>\n<p>A spell engine may contain an advanced talent, but must possess that talent&#8217;s minimum caster level, as well as all of its prerequisite talents. A spell engine may be used to meet the prerequisites for creating other magic items.</p>\n<p>A spell engine&#8217;s pricing is determined by comparing it to Table: Spell Engine Pricing.</p>\n<strong>Table: Spell Engine Pricing</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caster Level</th>\n<th># of Additional Magic Talents/Spell Points</th>\n<th>Price (gp)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 (base wand)</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>4,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>9,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>16,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>25,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>36,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>49,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>64,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>81,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>100,000</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
