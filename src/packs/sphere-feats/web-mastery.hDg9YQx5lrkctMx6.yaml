      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere (Vermin
      Transformation (transformation)) or web bestial trait.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> If you possess the web bestial trait,
      increase the number of times per day you may use the web bestial trait by
      twice your Constitution modifier. When you possess the Web Alteration
      trait, it may be used a number of times per minute equal to your
      Constitution modifier.</p>

      <p>Additionally, as a full-round action, you may render a creature that is
      entangled by your web and within your reach helpless. Such a creature
      counts as being tied up, increasing the DC to escape to 20 + 1/2 of your
      Hit Dice + Constitution modifier. The helpless creature may still attempt
      Strength and Escape Artist checks to free themselves as normal.</p>
