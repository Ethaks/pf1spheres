      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature, magic skill
      bonus +10.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may assist another spellcaster who also
      possesses this feat, granting them a temporary +1 bonus to their caster
      level, as well as granting them access to your spell points and talents as
      if they possessed them. You must spend a standard action every round to
      maintain this ability, and you must be within 30 feet of the caster you
      are aiding in this manner. A target may be helped by multiple casters at
      once in this manner, but all involved casters must remain within 30 feet
      of each other, and the effects are not strictly cumulative. It takes one
      assisting caster to add a +1 bonus, three to add a +2 bonus, six to add a
      +3 bonus, ten to add a +4 bonus, and fifteen to add a +5 bonus. No caster
      may receive more than a +5 bonus in this manner.</p>
