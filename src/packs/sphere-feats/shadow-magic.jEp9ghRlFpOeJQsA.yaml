      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere (Shadow Infusion) or
      shadow pool.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may mimic other spheres of magic by
      shaping shadowstuff. As a free action, you may spend 1 shadow point to
      grant yourself a temporary magic sphere or talent you do not possess from
      the following list: Alteration, Conjuration, Creation, Dark, Death,
      Destruction, Enhancement, Light, Nature, Protection or Weather sphere for
      1 minute. For every 5 surreal feats you possess, you may grant yourself an
      additional temporary talent from the chosen sphere. You must still meet
      any prerequisites that the talents possess. When gaining multiple talents
      with this feat, you may use a talent gained this way as a prerequisite for
      other gained talents.</p>

      <p>Any sphere talents or abilities gained from this feat are treated as if
      they were from the Illusion sphere and possess the shadow descriptor.
      Shadow magic, by its nature, has a very real effect even if disbelieved,
      although usually a reduced one. Unless stated otherwise, objects created
      as shadow illusions are made of shadowstuff (stable), and creatures have
      1/5th their normal hit points.</p>

      <p>The effective caster level of effects created using this feat is equal
      to your caster level in the Illusion sphere -2 (minimum 1). You may not
      have more than one sphere effect active at a time from the spheres granted
      from this feat. A second use of this feat immediately ends the duration of
      the previous use.</p>
