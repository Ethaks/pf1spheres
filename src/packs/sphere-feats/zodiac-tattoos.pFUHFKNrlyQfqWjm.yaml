      <p>Mystical tattoos ward you from harm and transform your skin into
      protective armor.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Craft (tattoos) 5 ranks, Unarmored
      Training or AC Bonus class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Covering your body in these intricate tattoos
      etched by your own hand, you gain the ability to have your skin enchanted
      with armor special abilities as though it was a suit of +1 leather armor.
      You cannot have a total bonus of armor special abilities higher than +6.
      You cannot use this ability to add any armor special abilities that add a
      flat gp amount to their cost instead of a bonus equivalent.</p>
