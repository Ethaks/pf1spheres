      <p>You can use alchemy to create dangerous ooze creatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brew Potion, Craft Wondrous Item, Craft
      (alchemy) 3 ranks, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can create living oozes as though they
      were magical items. Creating an ooze creature takes 1 day for each 500 gp
      in its construction cost. To create an ooze, you must have access to an
      oozing vat (see below), you must use up raw materials worth the
      construction cost of the ooze, and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy)
      check (DC 10 + 2 &#215; the ooze&#8217;s CR). A failed check ruins the
      materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more also results in an
      ooze that attacks its creator for 1d4 rounds before dissipating into
      useless waste material. A newly created ooze has average hit points for
      its Hit Dice.</p>

      <p>Oozes created with this feat are mindless and uncontrolled, and even
      normally intelligent oozes like slithering trackers that created this way
      have no Intelligence score&#8212;nor any loyalty to their creator.</p>

      <p>While ooze creatures cannot normally be purchased in traditional
      marketplaces, GMs who wish to include such an option in their
      games&#8212;perhaps with oozes sold as black market commodities&#8212;
      need only double the construction cost of a specific ooze creature in
      order to figure out a fair market price. The following table lists some of
      the most commonly crafted oozes and their creation requirements. At the
      GM&#8217;s discretion, other types of ooze creatures can be created with
      this feat.</p>
