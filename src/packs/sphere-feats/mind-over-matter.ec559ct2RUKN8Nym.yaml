      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you take hit point damage and are not
      flat-footed against the damage&#8217;s source, you may choose to spend
      spell points as a free action (even when it is not your turn) to delay
      some or all of the damage, effectively nullifying it for the moment when
      it occurs. For every spell point spent, you may delay an amount of damage
      equal to twice your Mind caster level (meaning a level 7 thaumaturge could
      delay 28 points of damage by spending 2 spell points). The damage is
      delayed for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p>In addition, by spending a spell point as a standard action, you may
      will your metabolic functions to respond differently. You may delay the
      effect of poison on yourself by altering its frequency by one step (rounds
      to minutes, minutes to hours, or hours to days, only usable once per
      poison), you may use your casting ability score instead of Constitution
      for holding your breath, and you may add your casting ability modifier as
      a bonus to checks to disguise your health under close observation (such as
      when feigning death).</p>

      <p>This is treated as a supernatural ability. Any delayed damage can be
      taken at a point prior to the expiration of the delay by dismissing the
      effect, as if dismissing a spell. Healing received while damage is delayed
      can preemptively negate the damage before the effect ends if you wish. If
      an attack&#8217;s damage is negated entirely, secondary effects of the
      damage are also negated if the secondary effect would be negated through
      damage reduction.</p>
