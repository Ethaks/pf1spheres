      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ability to gain martial focus,
      Constitution 13 or higher.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move action, you may expend focus to
      suppress a single instance of the dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened
      condition for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier
      (minimum 1). The duration of these conditions continues to expire while
      suppressed. You may instead choose to treat the frightened condition as
      shaken, the nauseated condition as sickened, the exhausted condition as
      fatigued, or the blinded condition as dazzled for the same duration. You
      may take this move action even if the condition would normally prevent you
      from taking move actions. You may only have one condition suppressed at a
      time; suppressing an additional condition forces you to stop suppressing
      the previous condition.</p>

      <p>If your base attack bonus is +10 or higher, you may suppress the dazed,
      frightened, nauseated, shaken, staggered, and stunned conditions and treat
      the panicked condition as shaken, though the duration of the suppression
      is cut in half (minimum 1 round).</p>
