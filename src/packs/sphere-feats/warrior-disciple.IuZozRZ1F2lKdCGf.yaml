      <p>In spite of your diverse magical training, your armed discipline still
      remains.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +3; ability to cast
      2nd-level spells, manifest 2nd-level powers, or spherecaster level
      3rd.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> At every level that a prestige class
      advances spellcasting, manifesting, or spherecasting from one of your
      classes, you may choose to have it also advance as if the prestige class
      had the same Hit Dice, base attack bonus, and caster level progression of
      the class whose spellcasting it advances.</p>

      <p>For example, a mageknight 10/forest lord 3 could take this feat
      choosing mageknight as its advanced casting class at its forest lord
      levels, causing the forest lord Hit Dice to become d10s, for the forest
      lord to grant full base attack bonus progression rather than normal 1/2
      base attack bonus progression, and for the forest lord&#8217;s caster
      level progression to advance at 1/2 class level as per a mageknight.</p>
