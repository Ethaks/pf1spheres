      <p>You maintain the power of a location even as you depart it.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Charged Spells drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> For the purpose of drawbacks or boons which
      alter your casting based on the location in which they are cast (such as
      the Area Bound or Terrain Casting drawbacks or the Atmoturgy or Draw Magic
      boons), you may determine all variables of any effect you create as if you
      were in the location in which you charged the effect rather than in the
      location in which you are casting the spell. This feat allows characters
      with the Terrain Casting drawback to cast spells in a blighted space so
      long as they prepared the spell charge in a non-blighted space.</p>
