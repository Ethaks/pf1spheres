      <p>When you learn the ins and outs of an engine, you can coax more from it
      than another engineer could.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Profession (engineer) 5 ranks.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you serve as a ship&#8217;s engineer for
      at least 1 week, you can coax greater feats than normal from that
      ship&#8217;s engine. When pushing an engine, its power increases by 75%.
      When overloading the engine, its power increases by 150%. When
      successfully aiding the pilot, you grant them an additional +2 bonus to
      their piloting checks.</p>
