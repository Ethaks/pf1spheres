      <p>As a character gains additional purring feats, the character&#8217;s
      ability to purr increases:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Purr Louder:</strong> For every 2 purring feats a character
      possesses, the character&#8217;s purring aura&#8217;s radius increases by
      +5 feet.</li>

      <li><strong>Complex Purring:</strong> For every two purring feats a
      character possesses past the 1st, whenever that character begins purring,
      they may select an additional, different purring feat to use
      simultaneously. A purring feat may not be used multiple times
      simultaneously even if the feat could make multiple selections. For
      example, a character with 3 purring feats could use a second purring
      simultaneously, 5 feats could use a third purring simultaneously,
      etc.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Some purring feats gain additional effects if you possess 4 or more
      purring feats, denoted as &#8220;Powerful Purring&#8221; as part of their
      entry.</p>
