    value: >
      <p>Aristeia amplifies your magical abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Casting class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> In any situation where you could use
      Aristeia, you gain a +1 bonus to your caster level. While you are in
      Aristeia, your Aristeia bonus also applies to your caster level (this
      stacks with the normal bonus from this feat) and you gain a number of
      temporary spell points equal to your Aristeia bonus while in Aristeia.
      These temporary spell points vanish when you leave Aristeia.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Sphere Focus (any one) or
      Spell Focus (any one) for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>
