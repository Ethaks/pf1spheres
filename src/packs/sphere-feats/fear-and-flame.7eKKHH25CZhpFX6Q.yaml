    value: >
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Fire Blast (blast
      type, fire)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When a creature is set on fire by your
      destructive blast, they must succeed at a Will save each round they remain
      on fire or become shaken. If shaken, they become frightened. If
      frightened, they become panicked. A successful save reduces the severity
      by one step and ending the on fire condition ends the effects of this
      feat, though not fear conditions from other sources.</p>
