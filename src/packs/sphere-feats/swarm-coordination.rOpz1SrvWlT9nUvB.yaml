      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere (Swarm Shape).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When under the effects of the Swarm Shape
      talent, you may perform combat maneuvers in place of dealing swarm damage.
      You may choose individually to deal damage or perform a maneuver against
      each creature that would receive swarm damage and may perform different
      maneuvers against each creature. These maneuvers provoke attacks of
      opportunity as normal. You may also hold and carry objects while in swarm
      form, though may not wield weapons or activate magic items. You count as a
      Small creature for determining your size bonus on these maneuvers and for
      carrying capacity, increasing by one size per 5 caster levels.
      Additionally, you threaten the squares you occupy while in swarm form, but
      still may not deal swarm damage as an attack of opportunity.</p>
