      <p>You&#8217;ve learned to mix your paints to be exceptionally vibrant,
      increasing their effects.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere (War Paint
      (formulae)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Treat the effects of any war paint you apply
      to yourself as though you had 5 additional ranks in Craft (alchemy). If
      you have 10 or more ranks in Craft (alchemy), you instead treat war paints
      you apply to yourself as though you had 10 additional ranks in Craft
      (alchemy).</p>
