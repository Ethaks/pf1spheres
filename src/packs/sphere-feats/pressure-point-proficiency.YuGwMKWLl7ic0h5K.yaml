      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere, Improved Unarmed
      Strike.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> By studying precisely where and how to strike
      your enemies, you can interrupt the biological processes that contribute
      to mental stability. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an
      opponent, it takes a -1 penalty to all Will saves until the end of your
      next turn. Multiple strikes you make against the same target do not stack,
      and the penalty to Will saves can apply to mind-affecting effects
      channeled through the strike.</p>
