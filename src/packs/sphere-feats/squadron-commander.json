      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> War sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You have a squadron of allies who experience greater benefits from your totems. Your squadron can include yourself and up to 3 additional allies, plus an additional ally for every 5 caster levels you possess or for every 5 ranks in Diplomacy you possess, whichever is higher. You can change the membership any time you rest and regain spell points, but you must touch a creature to add it to your squadron. You must spend 1 minute every day renewing the links between you and your squad members. You must have access to each member you wish to include. Your caster level at the time you renew this connection is used for this ability through the day, even if your caster level changes.</p>\n<p>Squadron members must be specific individuals. Squadrons can include summoned companions that are effectively the same creature being summoned each time (such as the companion summoned with the Conjuration sphere), but not spontaneously created creatures.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, instead of allies, your squadron may consist of yourself and one crew or troop.</p>\n<p>Members of your squadron gain increased bonuses from your totems. If a totem grants a bonus to any d20 roll or any number that is the target of a d20 roll (such as AC, attack rolls, saving throws, CMB, CMD, ability checks, skill checks, concentration checks, or spell penetration checks), that bonus increases by +1, and an additional +1 for every 10 War caster levels you possess.</p>\n",
