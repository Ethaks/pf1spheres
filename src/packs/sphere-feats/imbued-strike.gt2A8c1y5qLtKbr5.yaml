      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature, caster level
      1st.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a swift action, you can imbue your weapons
      with a fraction of your power. For 1 round, your weapons deal +1 damage
      and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
      For every +5 magic skill bonus you possess, this bonus increases by +1, to
      a maximum of +5. This ability counts as Arcane Strike for the purposes of
      qualifying or using feats, items, and abilities, and the bonus from this
      ability does not stack with the bonus from Arcane Strike. Any feat, item,
      or ability referencing the caster level of Arcane Strike instead uses the
      magic skill bonus. In addition, you are considered an arcane caster for
      the purpose of qualifying for feats that require Arcane Strike as a
      prerequisite.</p>
