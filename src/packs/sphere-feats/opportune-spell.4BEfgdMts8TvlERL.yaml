      <p>Incredible power waits to strike any who would cross you.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Magic skill bonus +7.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you would make an attack of opportunity,
      as an immediate action, you may use any magic sphere effect in conjunction
      with a strike talent or with a range of touch in place of the attack of
      opportunity. You cannot use this feat with an effect whose casting time is
      longer than 1 full-round action.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +4 spell points</p>
