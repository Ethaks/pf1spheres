      <p>Your magic prevents foes from exploiting idiosyncrasies in their
      magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Counterspell, casting class feature,
      magic skill bonus +7.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you perform a counterspell, you may
      choose to affect the target or targets with a magical suppression rather
      than a normal counterspell effect. Creatures affected by a magical
      suppression must spend an additional spell point to create a magical
      effect or else the effect fails. A magical suppression lasts for 1
      round.</p>

      <p>As part of suppressing a target, you may suppress a single drawback
      worth no more than a single drawback that the target possesses. A creature
      with a suppressed drawback is not considered to have that drawback when
      casting but cannot benefit from any boons or drawback feats which rely on
      that drawback so long as the drawback is suppressed.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Vancian casters would have to spend an
      additional spell slot/prepared spell of equal level to create an effect.
      Suppressing a drawback could suppress a somatic, verbal, emotion, thought,
      or focus component for a spell but would shut down any abilities
      explicitly tied to them (such as a bard&#8217;s Harmonic Spell continuing
      performance).</p>
