      <p>&#8220;And so you walk our path too, and shall experience and be a
      great many things, be you a traveler, wanderer, savior, or scourge to
      those you will cross paths with.&#8221; &#8211; A Realmwalker&#8217;s
      Initiation</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Knowledge (planes) 7 ranks, Survival 7
      ranks, Realmwalker Adept.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may select your favored plane with the
      Realmwalker Adept feat as a free or immediate action (rather than taking 1
      hour).</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain the following new abilities which grant benefits
      while in your favored plane:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Any Plane Is Home (Ex):</strong> While on your favored plane,
      you may treat that plane as your native plane. Whenever you would be
      treated as an extraplanar creature for the purposes of a dismissal spell,
      the Warp sphere Plane Manipulator (space) talent, or another effect which
      would send you back to your home plane, you may choose to be unaffected,
      as though you were an improper target for that effect.</li>

      <li><strong>Planar Endurance (Ex):</strong> You and your equipment are
      protected from weather conditions and can exist comfortably in any
      temperature without having to attempt Fortitude saves while in your
      favored plane. In addition, you gain energy resistance equal to 10 + your
      ranks in Knowledge (planes) against planar traits and weather native to
      your favored plane (such as the fire damage on a fire-dominant plane).
      This resistance stacks with other energy resistance you may possess.</li>

      <li><strong>Realmwalker&#8217;s Stride (Ex):</strong> You can move through
      your favored plane&#8217;s terrain at your normal speed, ignoring any
      difficult terrain native to your favored plane (such as moving through
      spike-like caltrops, snow, thorns, etc.). This ability counts as woodland
      stride, as the druid class ability, for the purposes of prerequisites and
      effects.</li>

      <li><strong>Trailblazer (Ex):</strong> You gain a +10 bonus to your base
      land speed while in your favored plane. In addition, you are immune to
      fatigue caused by hustling or forced marches (although you still take
      nonlethal damage as usual) while in your favored plane.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The abilities granted by this feat provide
      benefits against both natural and magical conditions, hazards, terrain,
      and weather which are native to your favored plane. These abilities do not
      provide benefits against effects which are not native to your favored
      plane, such as creature-made terrain and weather. For example, the planar
      endurance ability from this feat would protect against a fire-dominant
      plane&#8217;s traits, but not against a magical blizzard created by the
      Weather sphere on such a plane.</p>
