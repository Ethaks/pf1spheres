      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You must cast a conditional talent
      immediately before casting another talent on the same creature, eliciting
      a promise or warning against a behavior and binding the target to the
      paired talent. If you do not cast a paired talent, the conditional talent
      has no effect. The paired talent must be from the Alteration, Enhancement,
      Fate, Life, Mind, Nature, or Protection spheres and must be cast on a
      willing creature. If the talent&#8217;s recipient violates the oath or
      prohibition while the conditional talent remains in effect, the paired
      talent is undone as if never cast. If the talent was a healing talent, the
      hit point damage or condition you removed returns immediately, even if the
      subject has enjoyed subsequent rest or healing. Poisons, diseases, curses,
      restored ability damage, and negative levels removed by the paired talent
      return as well.</p>

      <p>This effect recognizes the spirit of your condition and does not
      trigger a violation due to unintended consequences or circumstances that
      the subject could not predict with her current knowledge of the situation.
      For instance, if the prohibition prevented the subject from laying a
      finger on royalty, touching a disguised prince would not count as a
      violation if the subject did not recognize the prince, nor would touching
      a member of royalty while dominated.</p>

      <p>The subject of the talent intuitively knows beforehand whether an
      action will cause it to lose the paired talent&#8217;s benefit.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>
