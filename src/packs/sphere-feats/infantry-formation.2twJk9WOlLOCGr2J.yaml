      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Squadron Commander or Troop
      Commander.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move action, you may expend your martial
      focus or spend 1 spell point to give all other squad members within close
      range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 ranks in Diplomacy) a free move action that
      can only be spent to move toward you to create one of three
      formations.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Cone:</strong> Additional allies who choose to use this free
      movement must end their turn standing adjacent to either yourself or other
      allies, forming a single cone.</li>

      <li><strong>Line:</strong> Additional allies who choose to use this free
      movement must end their turn standing adjacent to either yourself or other
      allies, forming a single line.</li>

      <li><strong>Square:</strong> Additional allies who choose to use this free
      movement must form up into a tight square formation.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>The first ally to move must move adjacent to at least one other squad
      member, the second ally to move must be adjacent to at least two other
      squad members, and any additional allies must either move adjacent to at
      least three other squad members, or move to be adjacent to an ally already
      adjacent to at least three other squad members.</p>
