      "value": "<p>&#8220;And so you walk our path too, and shall experience and be a great many things, be you a traveler, wanderer, savior, or scourge to those you will cross paths with.&#8221; &#8211; A Realmwalker&#8217;s Initiation</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Knowledge (planes) 7 ranks, Survival 7 ranks, Realmwalker Adept.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may select your favored plane with the Realmwalker Adept feat as a free or immediate action (rather than taking 1 hour).</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain the following new abilities which grant benefits while in your favored plane:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Any Plane Is Home (Ex):</strong> While on your favored plane, you may treat that plane as your native plane. Whenever you would be treated as an extraplanar creature for the purposes of a dismissal spell, the Warp sphere Plane Manipulator (space) talent, or another effect which would send you back to your home plane, you may choose to be unaffected, as though you were an improper target for that effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Planar Endurance (Ex):</strong> You and your equipment are protected from weather conditions and can exist comfortably in any temperature without having to attempt Fortitude saves while in your favored plane. In addition, you gain energy resistance equal to 10 + your ranks in Knowledge (planes) against planar traits and weather native to your favored plane (such as the fire damage on a fire-dominant plane). This resistance stacks with other energy resistance you may possess.</li>\n<li><strong>Realmwalker&#8217;s Stride (Ex):</strong> You can move through your favored plane&#8217;s terrain at your normal speed, ignoring any difficult terrain native to your favored plane (such as moving through spike-like caltrops, snow, thorns, etc.). This ability counts as woodland stride, as the druid class ability, for the purposes of prerequisites and effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Trailblazer (Ex):</strong> You gain a +10 bonus to your base land speed while in your favored plane. In addition, you are immune to fatigue caused by hustling or forced marches (although you still take nonlethal damage as usual) while in your favored plane.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The abilities granted by this feat provide benefits against both natural and magical conditions, hazards, terrain, and weather which are native to your favored plane. These abilities do not provide benefits against effects which are not native to your favored plane, such as creature-made terrain and weather. For example, the planar endurance ability from this feat would protect against a fire-dominant plane&#8217;s traits, but not against a magical blizzard created by the Weather sphere on such a plane.</p>\n",
