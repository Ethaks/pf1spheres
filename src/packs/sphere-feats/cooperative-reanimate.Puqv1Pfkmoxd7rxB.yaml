      <p>Undead you and your allies create resonate with each of your souls.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may give simple commands to undead under
      the control of an ally who also possesses this feat; if they receive
      conflicting orders, they act under their controller&#8217;s orders.</p>

      <p>In addition, if at any time you would fall unconscious or be dropped to
      0 hit points or less, you may choose to transfer any undead you have
      control over to another ally with this teamwork feat for 1 minute (or
      their normal maximum duration, whichever is shorter). Transferred undead
      may be returned to their owner during this time period as a move action,
      but can never be transferred to a third ally. After the duration expires,
      they are considered under your ally&#8217;s control and count towards your
      ally&#8217;s maximum Hit Dice total of undead they can have reanimated at
      once.</p>
