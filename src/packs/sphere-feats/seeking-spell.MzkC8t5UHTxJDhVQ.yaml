      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A seeking talent&#8217;s range can bend
      around obstacles to reach the intended target. You can define the route
      yourself or unambiguously identify a target and allow the talent to
      determine its own path. However, the talent fails if it would have to
      travel farther than its maximum range to reach the identified target. A
      ranged attack roll made to deliver a seeking talent is not subject to
      cover or concealment. In order to benefit from this effect, the selected
      talent must have a range greater than touch and target one or more
      creatures, or it must require the caster to make a ranged touch
      attack.</p>
