      <p>The soft paws pace around their target, slowly analyzing and waiting
      for the moment to pounce.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Perception 5 ranks, Scout sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The first attack of opportunity you make
      each round against a scouted target does not require you to expend an
      attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>After a successful attack action or attack of opportunity against an
      unscouted target, you may scout that target as an immediate action. You
      may expend 1 attack of opportunity to use this ability instead of spending
      an immediate action. A scout attempt made this way is performed before
      damage is rolled (and may allow you to use effects or abilities which
      apply against a scouted target as part of this attack).</p>
