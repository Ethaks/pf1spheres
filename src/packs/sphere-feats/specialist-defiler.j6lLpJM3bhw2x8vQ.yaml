    value: >
      <p>You draw extra energy from certain environments.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Terrain Casting drawback, non-good
      alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one type of terrain from the
      ranger&#8217;s list of favored terrains. Whenever you use Terrain Casting
      to blight this terrain, you may increase your caster level for the
      blight-causing effect by 1. This bonus to caster level is a competence
      bonus.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Defiler Feats:</strong> Rather than 1, your caster level
      increases by 2.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its
      effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new
      terrain. You cannot gain this feat if you possess the Terrain Focus feat
      and vice versa.</p>
