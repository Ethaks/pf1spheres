    value: >
      <p>A character with a purring feat gains the ability to purr, granting
      certain effects depending on the purring being used. Purring is an
      extraordinary ability which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>Purring is a physical action and may be performed so long as the
      character is not paralyzed or otherwise incapable of taking physical
      actions. Purring is conveyed by both touch and sound and is therefore not
      suppressed by silence and functions normally for a deafened creature.
      Purring does not interfere with a character&#8217;s normal capabilities
      (e.g. purring does not interfere with a character using Stealth to hide or
      the character&#8217;s ability to speak).</p>

      <p>A character with a purring feat may begin purring as a swift action,
      and may maintain their purring each round as a free action. Switching to a
      new purring requires a new swift action, including switching to the same
      purring but with a different selection. Only a single purring effect may
      be used at a time. There is no limit to how long a character can purr each
      day. While purring, the purring character gains an aura with a 5-foot
      radius, granting the benefits of each purring feat in use to each valid
      creature, including the purring character.</p>
