      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Basic Magic Training or casting class
      feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can create a variety of small magical
      effects. These effects are not powerful and are treated as sphere effects
      in all ways. They require a standard action to use, usually have a range
      of close, and are either instantaneous or have a duration of 1 hour
      depending on the effect created.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You may make a ranged touch attack, dealing 1d3 acid, electricity,
      fire, or cold damage to a target.</li>

      <li>You may clean, soil, or color up to 1 cubic foot of material per
      round.</li>

      <li>You may create floating lights the size of candle flames and move them
      up to 20 feet per round as a free action.</li>

      <li>You may create a spark such as with flint and steel, which may ignite
      flammable, unattended Fine objects.</li>

      <li>You may open or close a door or container weighing no more than 30
      lbs.</li>

      <li>You may chill, warm, or flavor 1&#160;lb. of nonliving material.</li>

      <li>You may create a small breeze from whichever direction you choose,
      strong enough to rustle clothing and flicker candles.</li>

      <li>You may lift objects weighing up to 1&#160;lb. and move them up to 10
      feet per round.</li>

      <li>You may create small non-speech sounds, such as that of a mouse
      screeching, soft simple harp music, or the hubbub of a whispered
      conversation.</li>

      <li>You may touch a creature or object and detect whether it possesses a
      magical aura. You may use Spellcraft to identify its aura as if using the
      detect magic spell.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can make up new effects, but they should not be more powerful than
      those listed above. The GM is the final arbiter of what is or is not a
      cantrip.</p>

      <p><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> An optional rule for Spheres of Power is
      giving this feat for free to all casters. The GM may decide whether to
      hand out this feat for free.</p>
