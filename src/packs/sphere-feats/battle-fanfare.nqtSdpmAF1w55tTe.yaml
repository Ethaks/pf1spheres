      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere, bardic performance or
      raging song class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The character gains the ability to attach
      tactics they create to their songs. While using bardic performance or
      raging song, the character may maintain an active tactic as part of the
      song without spending additional actions, this has no effect on the area
      affected by the tactic. They still must pay any costs associated with the
      tactic, such as martial focus if required, to use the tactic.</p>

      <p>Once per round you may recenter an ongoing tactic maintained as part of
      using bardic performance or raging song at a new location. Whenever the
      character creates a new tactic, they may attach it to their song or create
      it normally. Tactics attached to songs can be ended as a free action.
      Finally, as long as the song continues, the character may shout once per
      round as a swift or move action.</p>
