      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +5, Improved Trip or
      a combat talent that allows you to perform a trip without provoking an
      attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can trip flying opponents. If you would
      successfully trip a flying opponent, it falls at a rate of 10 ft per round
      for every point of base attack bonus you possess (assuming it is conscious
      and attempting to remain airborne; otherwise, it falls at a rate of 500 ft
      per round) until it hits the ground. The creature falls immediately after
      being tripped, then again each round thereafter at the end of your
      turn.</p>

      <p>Upon impact, the creature falls prone and takes normal falling damage
      (maximum: 1d6 per 10 ft. in its falling speed). A falling creature is
      considered entangled until it hits the ground, but it can attempt a Fly
      check as a free action at the start of its turn to stop falling before it
      hits the ground (DC = 15 + your base attack bonus); otherwise, it is
      unable to move (other than falling) but can act normally. You can choose
      to descend with the opponent, although this movement cannot exceed two
      times your normal flight speed.</p>
