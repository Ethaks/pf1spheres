      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Creatures affected by your sphere effects can
      develop an addiction to receiving your magic. Whenever a creature fails a
      saving throw (or accepts an effect willingly) against a sphere effect that
      is also affected by this feat, it must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC
      is identical to the saving throw for the sphere effect itself), or develop
      dependance to your magic, as if they possessed the Addictive Casting
      drawback, except instead of having to make Fortitude saves against
      addiction whenever they spend a spell point (or do not spend a spell
      point), they instead must make Fortitude saves whenever they are affected
      by one of your sphere effects that spends one or more spell points. This
      dependance may be cured as dependance is cured, the addiction DC resets
      itself to 10 once more if they are subjected to this feat again.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point. If you possess this feat as a
      drawback feat, the cost is reduced to 0 as long as it is used with a
      sphere ability that requires spending 1 or more spell points.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may only take this feat as a drawback
      feat if you possess the Addictive Casting drawback.</p>
