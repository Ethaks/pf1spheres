      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Admixture), Weather
      sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using Admixture, you may spend an
      additional spell point to affect one target damaged by the destructive
      blast with a shroud effect you know in place of a second blast type. If
      you possess Encompassing Weather, you may apply the shroud to any targets
      damaged, up to your maximum targets from Encompassing Weather.</p>
