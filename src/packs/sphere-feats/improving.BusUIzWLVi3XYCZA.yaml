      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Enhancement sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Whenever you begin using the improving purr,
      choose one enhance sphere effect you or your equipment are currently under
      the effects of. While using the improving purr, whenever an ally begins
      their turn within your purring aura, that ally gains the benefits of the
      chosen enhance sphere effect for 1 round.</p>

      <p>If the chosen enhance sphere effect would target a piece of equipment,
      that ally must choose which piece of equipment under their possession is
      enhanced; an enhance effect shared this way must be able to target that
      creature or held piece of equipment normally (such as sharing the Enhance
      Equipment (enhance) with an ally&#8217;s natural attack requires you to
      possess the Natural Enhancement talent). The chosen enhance sphere
      effect&#8217;s duration is not extended by this ability; you may not use
      the improving purr if you are not benefiting from an enhance sphere
      effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> Whenever a creature benefits from
      the improving purr, that creature retains the benefits of the chosen
      enhance talent for an additional round.</p>
