      <p>In your greatest moment, you are given increased clarity regarding your
      surroundings.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks
      which increases by an additional +2 for every 10 ranks you have in
      Perception (to a maximum of +6 at 20 ranks). When you enter Aristeia, you
      gain all-around vision and blindsense out to 60 feet while in Aristeia.
      This improves to blindsight if you enter Aristeia level 3 or higher. If
      you enter Aristeia level 4 or higher, you also gain the benefits of the
      True Seeing advanced Divination talent while in Aristeia.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Skill Focus (Perception)
      for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>
