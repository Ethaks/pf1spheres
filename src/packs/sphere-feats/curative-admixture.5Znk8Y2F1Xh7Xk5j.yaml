      <p>Ruinous and restorative power alike flow from your will.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Admixture), Life
      sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using Admixture, you may spend an
      additional spell point to have a single creature that takes damage be
      targeted by a cure, invigorate, or restore. If you possess the Mass
      Healing talent, you may apply the cure, invigorate, or restore to all
      targets damaged, up to your maximum targets from Mass Healing. A Life
      sphere effect which would deal damage (such as a cure on an undead or in
      conjunction with the Affliction talent) instead deals no damage when used
      with this feat.</p>
