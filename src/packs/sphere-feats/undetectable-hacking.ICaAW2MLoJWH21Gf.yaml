      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Tech sphere (Remote Control), Remote
      Hacking.</p>

      <p>When you attempt to control a foreign gadget, whether it succeeds or
      fails on its Will save it must immediately succeed at a second Will save.
      If it fails this second save, it does not realize it it was subject to a
      hack attempt (including knowing if any routines were transferred).</p>
