    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may consume the brain of an unconscious
      creature or a creature who has died within the last 24 hours as a
      fullround action. A corpse preserved by the Corpse Manipulation talent may
      have its brain consumed in this way within a week of its death. This
      functions as a coup de grace against a living creature with a base damage
      of 4d8 + your Strength modifier and a critical multiplier of x2. Doing so
      grants you a +2 insight bonus to two skills that the creature whose brain
      you ate possessed ranks in. You may only benefit from having one brain
      eaten at a time, but these bonuses last until the next time you consume a
      creature&#8217;s brain. You are immune to any non-magical diseases you are
      exposed to as part of consuming a creature&#8217;s brain and do not suffer
      any mundane negative health effects from consuming a creature&#8217;s
      brain, even if it would not normally be part of your natural diet. You
      gain no benefit from consuming the brains of subordinates. The
      creature&#8217;s brain is not eaten if they are not killed by this effect
      and you cannot consume the brains of creatures that lack brains (at GM
      discretion).</p>
