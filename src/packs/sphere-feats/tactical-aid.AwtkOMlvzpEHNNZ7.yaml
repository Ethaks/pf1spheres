      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you use the aid another action, you
      may choose to increase the target&#8217;s base attack bonus by 2 for the
      duration of the aid another action rather than providing the normal
      benefit. This ability cannot be affected by effects which would increase
      the benefit granted from aid another.</p>
