      <p>You fuel your magic with your body with purpose, refining it more than
      ever before.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Addictive Casting drawback or Decrepit
      Casting drawback, magic skill bonus 5 .</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you create a sphere effect, you can
      choose to fail your saving throw from the drawback used to qualify for
      this feat in order to fuel the power behind the sphere effect.</p>

      <p>The sphere effect manifests with a +1 competence bonus to its caster
      level, and costs 1 less spell point (minimum 0). Sphere effects reduced to
      0 spell points still count as if they cost at least 1 spell point when
      determining the effects of your drawbacks.</p>

      <p>You can utilize this feat three times per day, plus an additional use
      at 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter.</p>
