      <p>Your martial training and natural heartiness are the only tools you
      need to tackle even the mightiest foes.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Con 13, base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When performing or resisting a combat
      maneuver against a foe who is at least 1 size category larger than
      yourself, you gain a bonus to your CMB and CMD equal to +1 per size
      category larger than yourself the opponent is (for example, a Small
      character would gain a +4 bonus to resist or perform combat maneuvers
      against a Gargantuan opponent). In addition, you can use combat maneuvers
      against targets 1 size larger than would normally be allowed (e.g.,
      although normally a creature cannot drag a target more than 1 size
      category larger than itself, a character with this feat could drag targets
      up to two size categories larger than itself).</p>
