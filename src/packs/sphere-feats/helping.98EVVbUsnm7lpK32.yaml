      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> While using the helping purr, whenever an
      ally within your purring aura would perform an attack roll or skill check,
      you may use the aid another action to improve that ally&#8217;s attack
      roll or skill check as a free action that can be taken even when it is not
      your turn. You may only use the aid another action this way once per round
      and may aid a creature this way even if you normally could not (such as
      not threatening the attacking creature, etc.).</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> While using the helping purr,
      whenever you use the aid another action, you grant the assisted creature a
      number of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your character level which
      last for 1 minute.</p>
