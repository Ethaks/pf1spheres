      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Caster level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may accept 2 or more points of
      Constitution burn as a free action. Doing so grants 1 temporary spell
      point per 2 points of burn that expires at the end of your turn. If these
      temporary spell points are spent on a sphere effect that deals damage,
      half that damage becomes untyped damage and the effect bypasses spell
      resistance. The number of spell points granted per 2 points of burn
      increases by +1 every ten character levels. You cannot use this ability if
      doing so would reduce your Constitution to 0.</p>
