      <p>Your retinue of followers has attracted some skilled individuals you
      can call on in a time of need.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere ((follower) package),
      call in a specialist logistic specialty.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using your call in a specialist logistic
      specialty, you may recruit a specialist from your followers so that the
      specialist appears in half the time they&#8217;d normally take to arrive.
      For example, a level 11 commander recruits an equipment specialist, who
      arrives in 6.5 hours instead of 13.</p>

      <p>In addition, whenever your followers attempt a skill check using your
      ranks or bonus in Diplomacy, they gain a +2 bonus on that check. If you
      have 10 or more ranks in Diplomacy, this bonus increases to +4.</p>
