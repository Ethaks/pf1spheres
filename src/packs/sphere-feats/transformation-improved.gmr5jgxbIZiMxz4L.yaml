      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Transformation, character level
      5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one trait for every 5 character levels
      you possess (minimum 1) from the Blank Transformation ability of the
      Alteration sphere, from the talent chosen for the Transformation feat,
      another Alteration sphere talent you possess, or another trait deemed
      appropriate to the form selected for your Transformation feat by the GM.
      You may not select a trait that carries an additional spell point cost.
      You gain one set of traits for each instance of the Transformation feat
      that you possess. Once selected, these traits and their specific
      manifestations cannot be changed. You may take the Perfect Imitation
      talent or the Retain Ability talent in place of a trait and may apply them
      to your Transformation form. Additionally, the time required to change
      shape with the Transformation feat is reduced to a swift action.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Traits gained from this feat count against
      the maximum number of traits you may receive from the shapeshift ability
      of the Alteration sphere. You may choose to suppress one or more traits
      granted by this ability when you assume a particular Transformation form.
      Alternatively, you may choose to gain one or more traits from a particular
      set without the base form.</p>
