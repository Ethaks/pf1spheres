      <p>Your body is sustained by necromantic power.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As an immediate action, you may add your
      Charisma modifier as a bonus to a single Fortitude saving throw. If you
      would already add your Charisma modifier to the saving throw, you instead
      gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to the number of necrosis feats you
      possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> You always add your Charisma
      modifier (or number of necrosis feats) as a bonus to Fortitude saving
      throws. Once per day as an immediate action, when you would be reduced to
      0 or fewer hit points, you may spend a spell point to gain temporary hit
      points equal to your Hit Dice times your Charisma modifier. These
      temporary hit points last for one minute.</p>
