      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a move action or a free action with the
      expenditure of a shadow point, you may create and instantaneously equip a
      non-magical version of a weapon, piece of ammunition, light armor, or
      light shield you are proficient with out of stable shadowstuff. In the
      case of exotic weapons, you must have studied a pre-existing version of
      the weapon for at least 1 week. This object dissipates one round after you
      are no longer in contact with it or if you use this feat a second time.
      Creating ammunition using this feat may be done as part of the same action
      required to load a weapon instead of a move action without having to spend
      a shadow point.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may create an additional simultaneous
      object with a single use of this feat per 5 character levels.</p>
