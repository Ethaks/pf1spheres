      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Magical Signs drawback.</p>

      <p>By interweaving illusions with all of your spells and sphere effects
      you change their sensory manifestation.</p>

      <p>When you select this feat chose a theme such as weapons, cubes, demons,
      skulls, or slime. You may change the appearance but not any other effect
      of any spell or sphere ability you cast to manifest instead as the chosen
      theme.</p>

      <p>Magical Signs still breaks stealth, revealing you as the source of the
      magic, and your casting tradition. However, Magical Signs no longer
      automatically identifies altered spells, sphere abilities, or talents you
      use, but must be identifed gaining a +5 to the Spellcraft DC to identify
      them. Additionally, altered spells and sphere effects gain a +1
      circumstance bonus against dispelling or counterspell attempts. Illusions
      you create within your theme gain a +1 competence bonus to their caster
      level.</p>

      <p>This feat can only alter spells or sphere effects that have an obvious
      auditory or visual manifestation.</p>
