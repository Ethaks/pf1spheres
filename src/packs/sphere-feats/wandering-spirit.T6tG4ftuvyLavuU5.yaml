      <p>Your soul begins to loosen its grip on your body, preparing itself to
      flee if threatened.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. By spending 8 hours
      creating an intense mystical connection between you and an object, you can
      designate it as your phylactery. When you would die/ be destroyed from hit
      point loss, you can spend a spell point as an immediate action to transfer
      your soul to your phylactery, as long as it is in close range. Your soul
      stays in its phylactery for 1 round. During this time, your body may be
      healed, as long as your phylactery remains unbroken.</p>

      <p>If your new hit point total is greater than a negative amount equal to
      your Constitution score (or greater than 0, if you are undead), then you
      come back to life and stabilizes at your new hit point total. You
      otherwise remain dead. If you are brought back to life in this manner, you
      gain a temporary negative level. For each necrosis feat you possess beyond
      this one, your soul remains in its phylactery for one additional round.
      Your phylactery has a number of hit points and break DC equal to 5 times
      the number of necrosis feats you possess, and a hardness equal to triple
      your necrosis feats.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> Your soul stays in its phylactery
      for up to 1 minute per necrosis feat, and your phylactery functions as
      long as it is within long range.</p>
