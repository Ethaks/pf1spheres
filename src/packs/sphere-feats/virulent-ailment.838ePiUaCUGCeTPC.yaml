      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere and 5th caster level; or
      Death sphere and 5th caster level; or Duelist sphere and base attack bonus
      +5; or Alchemy sphere and base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You learn to create a terrible, contagious
      disease and learn to utilize it with your powers. As a standard action you
      may either spend a spell point or expend your martial focus to make a
      melee touch attack. If you hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude
      save or suffer from the blight disease.</p>

      <p>You may also infuse your disease into your sphere effects or attack
      actions. When you target one or more creatures using a magic sphere
      effect, you may spend a spell point or increase the casting time by one
      step in order to force one of the targets to succeed at a Fortitude save
      or suffer from your blight disease.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, when making an attack action as a standard action, you
      may expend your martial focus as a move action to force the target of your
      attack action to attempt a Fortitude save as above. The effects of this
      feat resolve independently of, and after the results of, the sphere effect
      or attack action. This means that even if the sphere effect fails to
      affect the target, or the attack action misses, the target must still
      attempt a save against the disease.</p>
