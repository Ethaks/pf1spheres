      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Magic skill bonus +3.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> This feat allows the user to craft magical
      weapons and magical armor. Crafting magical weapons and magical armor
      follows the same rules as core Pathfinder magical weapons and armor,
      except that a creature must possess the base sphere associated with any
      special ability before it can be added. Some core Pathfinder special
      abilities that can be added to magical weapons or armor carry prices
      calculated in gp costs rather than bonus increases; some of these special
      abilities are enchantments more appropriately created through the Craft
      Marvelous Item or Craft Apparatus feats, which should be used to craft
      such enchantments.</p>

      <p>Magical weapons and armor use the crafter&#8217;s MSB rather than their
      caster level when determining the maximum caster level item they can
      create. The item&#8217;s caster level must be at least 3x the enhancement
      bonus of the weapon or armor. If the item has other magical enchantments
      placed upon it, use the higher caster level. A magical weapon or magical
      piece of armor must have at least a 1 enhancement bonus to have any other
      special abilities.</p>
