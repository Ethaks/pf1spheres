      <p>Miracles of all sorts buckle before your might.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Counterspell.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can counterspell effects which were
      created with the Alien Source at no penalty. Your abilities that would
      suppress magic (such as such as the Spell Ward and Anti-Magic Aura effects
      of the Protection sphere) function normally against all magic effects
      regardless of source. In addition, you can attempt to use any of your
      Counterspell feats or other magic-negating abilities on technological
      equipment as if it were magical equipment. Treat a technological
      item&#8217;s MSD as if it were the item&#8217;s Craft DC -5 (or 11 + the
      item&#8217;s level if using Starfinder equipment).</p>
