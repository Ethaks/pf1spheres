      <p>You have learned to hold rituals in your memory to a minor degree.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Spherecaster (Spheres of Power).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may choose one ritual per day you may use
      up to the highest level you may cast. By spending 15 minutes preparing
      beforehand, you may cast this ritual once as a spellcaster at any point
      during that day. This may also be a lower-level ritual augmented by any
      metamagic feats you possess, so long as its effective level does not
      exceed that which you can cast. All drawbacks of your tradition still
      apply, and the spell may be augmented by any tradition boons you possess.
      Rather than a material cost, (unless the spell has costly material
      components already listed), you must spend a number of spell points at the
      time you prepare the ritual dependent on the level of the ritual in
      question: 0-2: 1 spell point, 3-5: 2 spell points, 6-8: 3 spell points, 9:
      4 spell points.</p>
