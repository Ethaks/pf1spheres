      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Combat Stamina or a grit pool, ki pool,
      luck pool, or panache class feature; base attack bonus +1.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose a basic (rally) talent. You may rally
      yourself with this talent at any time by spending either 5 stamina points
      or one grit, ki, luck, or panache point for every spell point you would
      normally need to spend. If you do so, the rally is considered an
      extraordinary ability, and may be used within areas where magic does not
      function. For the purposes of this rally, you use your base attack bonus
      as your caster level and your highest mental ability for your casting
      ability, if you do not already possess a casting tradition. This ability
      is not a true rally and does not interact with other abilities that affect
      rallies.</p>
