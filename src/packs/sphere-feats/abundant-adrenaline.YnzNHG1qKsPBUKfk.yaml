      <p>The designs of your creators left your adrenal glands on overdrive,
      granting you incredible swiftness for a short period of time.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Construct type or subtype, character
      level 3rd.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Once per hour, you can take an extra swift
      action for two turns, but for the next three turns afterward you receive
      no swift actions. You cannot use any extra swift actions to cast
      spells.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may take this feat a total of twice. When
      taken a second time, once per hour you can take an extra standard action
      for two turns, but for the next three turns afterward you receive no
      standard actions. You cannot use any extra standard actions to cast
      spells.</p>
