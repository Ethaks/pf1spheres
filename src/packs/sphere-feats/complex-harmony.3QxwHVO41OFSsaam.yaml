      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bardic performance class feature,
      character level 10th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may start a second bardic performance
      while maintaining another. Starting the second performance costs 2 rounds
      of bardic performance instead of 1. Maintaining both performances costs a
      total of 3 rounds of bardic performance for each round they are
      maintained.</p>

      <p>This ability does not stack with any other method of maintaining
      simultaneous bardic performances.</p>
