      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Alteration sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain a +1 bonus on concentration checks
      for Alteration sphere effects for every Aristeia feat you possess. When
      you enter aristeia, you gain a single Alteration sphere trait that you may
      select for the duration of your aristeia. If you possess 4 or more
      aristeia feats, you gain an additional trait when in aristeia. These
      traits are chosen when you enter aristeia and do not count towards the
      maximum number of traits you may gain from the Alteration sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as Combat Casting for the
      purpose of meeting prerequisites.</p>
