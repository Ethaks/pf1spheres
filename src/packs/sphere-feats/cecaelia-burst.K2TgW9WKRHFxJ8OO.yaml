      <p>When the time to withdraw into the depths comes, you are able to
      retreat with preternatural quickness.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Cecaelia subtype, character level
      3rd.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You are able to swim 150 ft backward as a
      full-round action, as the jet universal monster ability. You must move in
      a straight line while jetting, but your movement does not provoke attacks
      of opportunity.</p>
