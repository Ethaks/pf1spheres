      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> A furious talent that deals hit point damage
      adds the talent&#8217;s caster level to the amount of damage dealt by the
      talent. Talents that affect multiple targets deal the extra damage once to
      each target, regardless of whether the talent deals its damage all at once
      or in multiple hits (in the latter case, add the extra damage to the first
      hit against each target). In addition, a furious talent can be cast while
      the caster is enraged, including during a barbarian rage or while affected
      by a rage talent. Even a furious talent that requires an emotion component
      (as required by the Emotional Casting drawback) can be cast while enraged.
      The caster gains a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks and magic
      skill checks related to casting a furious talent if she is enraged.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 spell point</p>
