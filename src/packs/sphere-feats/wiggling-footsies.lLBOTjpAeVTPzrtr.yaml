      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fencing sphere (Footwork), Scout sphere
      (Calibrating Wiggle).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Whenever you use the Fencing sphere Footwork
      talent in response to an attack made against you, you may also scout the
      attacker. If you successfully avoid the attack (e.g. missing or succeeding
      at a Reflex saving throw) and you have scouted the attacker (whether
      previously scouted or as part of this ability), you gain the Scout sphere
      Calibrating Wiggle&#8217;s bonus precision damage on your first successful
      attack made against the attacker before the end of your next turn, even if
      you do not make a charge attack against them.</p>

      <p>In addition, whenever you deal the Scout sphere Calibrating
      Wiggle&#8217;s bonus precision damage to a target, you may regain martial
      focus as a free action that can be taken even when it is not your
      turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Abilities which function similarly to the
      Fencing sphere Footwork talent may be used to qualify for this feat in
      place of the Footwork talent (such as the Warp sphere Emergency Teleport
      talent, swashbuckler&#8217;s dodging panache deed, or other ability
      subject to GM discretion), and may treat evading an attack with such an
      abilities as using the Footwork talent for the purposes of this feat.</p>
