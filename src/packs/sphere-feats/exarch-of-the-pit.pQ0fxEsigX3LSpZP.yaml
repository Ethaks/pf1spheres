      <p>You are the will of your fiendish patron made manifest.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain several benefits associated with
      controlling others or gaining favors.</p>

      <p><strong>One Damnation Feat:</strong> You gain a +2 profane bonus on
      Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against evil creatures as well as a +2
      bonus on a Profession check of your choice.</p>

      <p><strong>Two Damnation Feats:</strong> Choose a creature type from the
      ranger&#8217;s favored enemy list. Creatures of that type take a -1
      penalty to saving throws against your abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Three Damnation Feats:</strong> The skill bonuses and saving
      throw penalty always apply against other followers of your patron (be they
      a god, demigod, or organization) and are doubled against such
      creatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Damnation Feats:</strong> If you possess the Fiendish
      Obedience or Deific Obedience feat, you receive the boons of these feats 2
      Hit Dice earlier than you normally would (at 10, 14, and 18 Hit Dice
      rather than 12, 16, and 20). This does not affect the level at which you
      gain these abilities if you take a prestige class that causes you to
      receive them at earlier levels but does stack with the Diverse Obedience
      feat.</p>
