      <p>Magical gateways are tools you can weaponize.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Mass Teleport [mass],
      Portal (advanced), Wormhole (space)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can use portals you create in a variety
      of offensive and defensive ways depending on what other abilities you
      have.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Adhesive Portal:</strong> (requires Creation sphere) As part
      of creating a portal, you may cause it to stick to a flat surface that you
      can alter and that is large enough to keep the entire portal on a flat
      plane. The portal moves with whatever surface it is stuck to. Targets that
      collide with the surface pass through the portal unless they succeed at a
      Reflex save against your Warp sphere DC.</li>

      <li><strong>Slicing Portal:</strong> Whenever a creature is passing
      through a portal you have created, you may spend an immediate action to
      forcibly close the portal while they are in transit. The creature passing
      through takes 1d6 damage per two Warp sphere caster levels you possess,
      taking half damage and remaining on whatever side of the portal they
      choose if they succeed at a Reflex save against your Warp sphere DC. On a
      failed save, you choose what side of the portal the creature ends up
      on.</li>

      <li><strong>Throw Portal:</strong> (requires Ranged Warp and Unwilling
      Teleport) You may move a portal you have created up to 5 feet per 2 caster
      levels as a standard action (this action counts as concentrating on the
      portal). Any creature which would have the portal move into their space
      must make a Reflex save against your warp sphere DC to avoid passing
      through the portal. The portal must remain within the range of your Ranged
      Warp talent at all times.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note: Moving Portals:</strong> For any circumstance in which a
      portal would be moving (in a manner similar to that outline with Throw
      Portal), creatures in the way are allowed a Reflex save against your Warp
      sphere DC to avoid passing through the portal.</p>
