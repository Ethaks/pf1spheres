      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Conjuration sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you choose to concentrate on a sphere
      effect, as a swift action you may pass concentration on that sphere effect
      to your companion within close range (based on your Conjuration caster
      level). You must have line of effect to the companion to do so. As long as
      the companion remains within close range, you may resume concentrating on
      the effect at any time as a swift action. A companion may not concentrate
      to maintain the effect that summoned it, nor on any effect to which it
      lacks line of effect. If the companion leaves close range, it may continue
      to concentrate on the effect, but you may not resume concentrating on it
      yourself. A mindless companion may not assume concentration of a sphere
      effect. Treat the companion&#8217;s Hit Dice as levels in a caster class
      for determining its bonus on concentration checks. If the companion does
      not have a casting ability modifier, use its Charisma to determine its
      concentration check bonus.</p>
