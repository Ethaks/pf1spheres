      <p>Whisper your lamentations to the world.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. Whenever you speak,
      you can choose to broadcast your voice to all creatures within a medium
      range, allowing anyone to hear you speak as though you were adjacent to
      them. Attempts to muffle your voice through mundane methods (such as
      covering your mouth, being gagged, etc.) fail to silence you and allow you
      to provide verbal components through such attempts to silence you, such as
      those required by the Verbal Casting general drawback. Magical,
      supernatural, and extraordinary silencing effects still function
      normally.</p>

      <p>You can add verbal components when casting any sphere effect with the
      curse or death descriptor or that deals negative energy damage, causing
      you to be clearly heard by anyone as though broadcasting your voice. If
      you do, creatures that can hear you broadcast your voice and fail their
      saving throw against the sphere effect take a -2 on attack rolls against
      you for a number of rounds equal to the number of necrosis feats you
      possess. If the effect does not have a saving throw, an affected creature
      attempts a Will saving throw against the sphere effect&#8217;s regular DC
      instead.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> When broadcasting your voice, you
      have greater control over the pitch and distance, from a minimum of 30
      feet, to a maximum of long range. If you spend a spell point when adding
      verbal components to a sphere effect with this feat, creatures who fail
      their saving throw take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, not just attack
      rolls against you.</p>
