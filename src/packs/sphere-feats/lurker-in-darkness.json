      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Stealth 6 ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Creatures using unusual forms of sensory perception such as blindsight, greensight, or tremorsense cannot automatically foil your use of Stealth; such creatures must attempt a Perception check as normal to detect you when you make use of the Stealth skill, though they gain a +2 bonus for each unusual form of perception you must try to avoid beyond the first. Lurker In Darkness foils indirect detection (such as a creature using detect magic to search for your magical items while you are using Stealth) in the manner described above, but has no effect on psi-like abilities, powers, spells, spell-like abilities, and/or supernatural abilities specifically used to uncover information about you rather than enhancing the user&#8217;s perception, such as the augury spell. However, when interacting with sphere talents and abilities, Lurker In Darkness foils Divination sphere sense abilities in the manner described above, but has no effect on the Divination sphere divine abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This feat was previously published in the Psionic Bestiary, by Dreamscarred Press. It has been modified to work with Spheres of Power.</p>\n",
