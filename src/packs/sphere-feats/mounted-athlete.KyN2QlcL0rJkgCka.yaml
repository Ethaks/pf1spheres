      <p>The handler is often as athletic as the mount.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Beastmastery sphere
      ((ride) package).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever your mount would attempt a skill
      check associated with an Athletics sphere package you possess, you may
      attempt that skill check for your mount, using your bonus in that skill.
      For example, if you possess the (leap) or (run) packages, you may attempt
      Acrobatics checks for your mount whenever your mount would attempt such a
      check.</p>

      <p>In addition, you share your Athletics sphere talents with your mount.
      Your mount is treated as possessing any packages or talents you possess
      and uses your skill ranks and Athletics sphere save DC when determining
      the effects of shared talents.</p>

      <p>If your mount cannot maintain martial focus, shared Athletics sphere
      talents do not grant the ability to maintain martial focus.</p>

      <p>As long as you have martial focus, your mount counts as possessing
      martial focus when determining the benefits of shared Athletics sphere
      talents that require you to have martial focus (such as the Swift Movement
      talent). If your mount would expend martial focus to use a shared
      Athletics sphere talent, you must expend your martial focus and both you
      and your mount benefit from the shared talent&#8217;s effects (where
      applicable). A mount that is a practitioner and can maintain martial focus
      cannot use its own martial focus with shared Athletics sphere talents, but
      may use shared talents in combination with any talents it possesses.</p>

      <p>Your mount&#8217;s movement made using a movement mode corresponding to
      an Athletics sphere package you possess counts as your own movement for
      the purposes of Athletics sphere talents. This allows you to use Athletics
      sphere talents while mounted, such as using the Reflexive Twist talent to
      avoid an attack despite being mounted. Whenever your mount&#8217;s
      movement would allow you or your mount to use a (motion) talent, both you
      and your mount must use the same (motion) talent. If a (motion) talent
      would affect another creature, it only affects that creature a single time
      (such as the Dizzying Tumble (motion) talent only occurring once). If a
      (motion) talent would benefit you, it benefits both you and your mount
      normally (such as both you and your mount gaining miss chance from the
      Moving Target (motion) talent).</p>

      <p>Athletics sphere talents which allow you or your mount to take an
      action are only used by the creature that spent the required actions,
      unless both creatures spend the required actions. For example, if your
      mount uses the Diving Strike talent, only your mount gains the benefits
      and suffers the risks of the talent unless you also take the charge action
      with your mount, gaining the bonus damage to your attack but also
      suffering the fall damage.</p>
