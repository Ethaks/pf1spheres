    value: >
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When a creature takes hit point damage from a
      fearsome talent, if that creature fails its save against the talent, it
      becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the talent&#8217;s
      caster level (minimum 1 round). If the talent does not allow a save,
      creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the
      talent would have if it did allow a save) to negate the shaken effect. If
      the talent already causes creatures to become shaken, on a failed save,
      add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the shaken
      condition imposed by the talent. A fearsome talent cannot cause a creature
      to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken.</p>
