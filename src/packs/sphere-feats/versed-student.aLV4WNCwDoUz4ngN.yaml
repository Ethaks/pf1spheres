    value: >
      <p>You have acquired many varied skills, enabling you to pick up more
      advanced tactics.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Character level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> For the purpose of class features which are
      selected individually at advancing levels (such as alchemist discoveries,
      shifter bestial traits, striker arts, and witch hexes), you treat your
      character level as your class level for the purpose of determining which
      class features you can select (this includes advanced talents, grand
      hexes, and other such abilities which would normally only be selectable
      starting at higher levels). This feat does not grant any such abilities,
      but merely the ability to select them.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You may select this feat multiple times. Each
      time, it applies to talents from a different class.</p>
