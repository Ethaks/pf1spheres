      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere, Counterspell.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you successfully counterspell a
      non-instantaneous magical effect which is not targeting a creature or
      object (such as a Protection sphere barrier, a Warp sphere looped space,
      or a Destructive sphere energy sphere), instead of ending the effect, you
      may spend a spell point to lift and move the effect as per the Telekinesis
      sphere. You may not Bludgeon using a spell effect, although you may move
      it or affect it with sustained force. You may spend a spell point when you
      dismiss a sphere effect to affect it with this feat as if you had
      successfully counterspelled it.</p>
