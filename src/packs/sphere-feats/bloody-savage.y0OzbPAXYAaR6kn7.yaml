      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Vampiric Casting drawback, bite
      attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You automatically drain a creature&#8217;s
      blood (as described by the Vampiric Casting general drawback) as part of
      any successful bite attack. You may also choose to drain a
      creature&#8217;s blood as an option made after succeeding at a check to
      maintain a grapple. When you drain a creature&#8217;s blood, you gain 5
      temporary hit points and a +1 bonus on all Constitution-based saves and
      skill checks for one minute. You may stack the temporary hit points with
      themselves, up to a maximum amount of 5 temporary hit points for every 3
      Hit Dice you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have taken the Vampiric Casting
      drawback twice, you additionally gain a +1 bonus to all attack and damage
      rolls with your bite attack for one minute after draining blood,
      increasing by +1 at 10th character level and every 10 levels
      thereafter.</p>
