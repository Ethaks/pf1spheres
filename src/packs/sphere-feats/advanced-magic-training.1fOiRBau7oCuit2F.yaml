      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Basic Magic Training or casting class
      feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Treat any racial Hit Dice not granting
      spherecasting and your levels in non-spherecasting classes as Low-Casting
      classes when determining your total caster level, magic skill bonus, and
      magic skill defense. You gain spell points from casting tradition
      drawbacks, but otherwise do not add these levels when determining your
      spell point pool. If you do not possess levels in an actual spherecasting
      class or racial Hit Dice granting spherecasting, increase your spell point
      pool to become equal your casting ability modifier (minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> For retraining purposes, having the casting
      class feature counts as Advanced Magic Training.</p>
