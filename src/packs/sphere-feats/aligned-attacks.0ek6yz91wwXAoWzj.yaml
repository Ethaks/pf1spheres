      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Non-neutral alignment, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one alignment you possess. Your
      natural attacks count as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming
      damage reduction. If your alignment changes, you may select a new
      non-neutral alignment that you possess in place of the originally chosen
      alignment. If you cease to possess a non-neutral alignment, you lose the
      benefits of this feat until you gain a non-neutral alignment. This is an
      extraordinary (Ex) ability.</p>
