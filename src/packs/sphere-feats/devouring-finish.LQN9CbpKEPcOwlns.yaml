      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wrestling sphere, Brain
      Consumption.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you reduce a creature that you are
      grappling to 0 or fewer hit points or render it unconscious, you may
      devour its brain as a free action. This kills the creature if it does not
      possess some form of regeneration or other ability which would allow it to
      survive without a brain.</p>
