      3rd.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> With your telekinesis you can supplement your

      following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Dampening Field:</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal
      to your casting ability modifier.</li>

      <li><strong>Propelling Force:</strong> You gain a +10 feet enhancement
      bonus to your movement speeds.</li>

      <li><strong>Tactile Telekinesis:</strong> You add your casting ability
      modifier as a bonus to Strength checks, and Climb and Swim checks.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>These benefits lasts indefinitely. If you activate one of these
