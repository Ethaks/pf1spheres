      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Charged Spells drawback, Terrain
      Casting drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you prepare a spell charge, you may
      choose to blight the area around you as if you had cast a spell with the
      Terrain Casting drawback. If you do, you do not blight the terrain around
      you when you cast the charged effect even if you do not spend additional
      spell points or increase the casting time.</p>
