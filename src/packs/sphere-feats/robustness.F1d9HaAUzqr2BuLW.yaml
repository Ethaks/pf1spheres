      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you are the target of a sphere
      ability or supernatural ability that allows you to regain hit points that
      does not grant fast healing, you heal additional hit points equal to your
      Hit Dice. The increase in healing can not be greater than the original
      amount of healing granted. When you are granted fast healing, the fast
      healing heals 1 additional hit point per round.</p>
