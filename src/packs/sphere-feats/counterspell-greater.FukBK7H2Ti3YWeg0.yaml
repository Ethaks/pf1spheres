      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature, Counterspell,
      Improved Counterspell, magic skill bonus +15.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using the Counterspell feat, you may
      spend 2 additional spell points to target all magic within a 40-foot
      radius burst, whether it be magical effects or magic items. If your check
      succeeds against a magic item, that item&#8217;s magic is suppressed for 1
      minute per caster level. If your check succeeds against a magical effect,
      the effect is destroyed. You also have a 1% chance per caster level of
      destroying an antimagic field. If the antimagic field survives the greater
      counterspell, no items within it are affected.</p>

      <p>You may also spend the 2 additional spell points, but only target a
      single item. You attempt your magical skill check with a +5 bonus against
      this item. If you succeed, the item is permanently destroyed. Even
      artifacts are subject to this effect, though there is only a 1% chance per
      caster level of actually affecting such powerful items. If successful, the
      artifact&#8217;s power unravels, and it is destroyed. If an artifact is
      destroyed, you must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all
      spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal
      magic, not even miracle or wish. Destroying artifacts is a dangerous
      business, and it is 95% likely to attract the attention of some powerful
      being who has an interest in or connection with the device.</p>
