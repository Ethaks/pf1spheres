      <p>A solid frame can easily make the difference in a fight, and few are as
      firm bodied as you are&#8212;welded steel bars are hidden throughout your
      body, making you extraordinarily tough.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Construct type or subtype.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> All of your movement speeds are reduced by -5
      ft. and your weight doubles, but you gain a +1 natural armor bonus to AC,
      +1 racial bonus to CMB and CMD, and treat your Strength attribute as 2
      points higher when determining carrying capacity or making a
      Strength-based ability or skill check (though not when making attack rolls
      or weapon damage rolls).</p>
