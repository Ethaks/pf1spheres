      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere (Mage Feint), base
      attack bonus +3.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your casting ability modifier as a
      circumstance bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity incurred when
      charging or making ranged attacks. In addition, as a full-round action you
      may make a single ranged or charge attack and use your Mage Feint talent
      as part of the same action against that target.</p>
