      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere, Force Shield,
      character level 5th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> The shield bonus to armor class provided by
      your force shield increases to +3, +1 per 5 caster levels, and while
      benefiting from it you count as wielding a light shield when beneficial
      for the purposes of class features and other effects. It counts as having
      hardness equal to half your caster level and 10 hit points. If broken, you
      may reform it as a swift action (as if it had been dispelled). You may
      also make shield bash attacks with it as if it were a light shield.</p>
