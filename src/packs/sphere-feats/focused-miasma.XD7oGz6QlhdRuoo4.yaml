      <p>By focusing your naturally disruptive odor you are able to sap another
      creature of its willpower.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fermon alraun, odor of
      susceptibility.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> By spending a standard action to suppress
      your odor of susceptibility (provoking attacks of opportunity), you can
      narrow its effects into a miasma that targets only one creature within 20
      feet, increasing its penalty to -2 while it is within this range. This is
      a mind-affecting effect and creatures that do not need to breathe are
      immune to its effects. Deactivating focused miasma is a swift action.</p>
