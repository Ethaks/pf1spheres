      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Admixture),
      Enhancement sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using Admixture, you may spend an
      additional spell point to have a single creature that takes damage be
      targeted by an enhancement effect that you possess. If you possess the
      Mass Enhancement talent, you may apply the enhancement to any targets
      damaged, up to your maximum targets from Mass Enhancement. This ability
      can only target creatures, it cannot be used to affect objects.</p>
