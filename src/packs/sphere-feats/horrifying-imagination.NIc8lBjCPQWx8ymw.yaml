      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> For one additional spell point, anyone
      targeted by your spells or sphere effects, attempting a save against them,
      or within their area becomes shaken for 1d4+1 rounds unless they succeed
      at a Will saving throw using the same DC as the original spell. For two
      additional spell points, they instead become frightened for 1d4+1 rounds
      unless they succeed at a Will saving throw using the same DC as the
      original spell. On a successful save, they instead become shaken for 1d4+1
      rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Characters must only save
      against this effect once per spell or sphere effect it is applied to even
      if the modified spell requires additional saves.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> +1 or +2 spell points</p>
