      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack
      bonus +4, martial focus.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> You gain one ki power from the unchained
      monk&#8217;s list of ki powers, treating your base attack bonus as your
      unchained monk level and using your practitioner modifier in place of your
      Wisdom modifier when determining the effects of ki powers you gain.
      Whenever you would gain ki powers that require the unchained monk to be of
      a specific level or higher before they can be chosen, use your base attack
      bonus in place of your unchained monk level.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you do not have a ki pool, instead of
      spending one or more ki points on a ki power, you may instead spend one
      spell point per ki point required. As long as you have one or more spell
      points in your spell pool, you are treated as having at least one ki point
      in your ki pool for the purposes of ki powers.</p>
