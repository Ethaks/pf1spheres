      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> 1 rank in any Strength- or
      Dexterity-based skill.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> By spending 10 minutes stretching (such as
      doing yoga, martial exercises, etc.), you gain a catisthenics pool with a
      number of dice equal to 1 + 1 for every 3 Hit Dice you possess.</p>

      <p>You may spend a catisthenics die as part of attempting a Strength- or
      Dexterity-based skill check to add +1d6 to that roll. You may spend 10
      minutes to stretch and replenish your catisthenics pool, regaining up to
      the maximum number of catisthenics dice.</p>

      <p>If a catisthenics die is used at the same time as another ability which
      adds a bonus die to a check (such as investigator&#8217;s inspiration,
      sage&#8217;s meditation, etc.), the bonus granted by a catisthenics dice
      is decreased to +1d4.</p>
