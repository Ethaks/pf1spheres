      <p>You integrate multiple traditions to unleash a potent form of
      magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Caster level 1st or higher with at
      least two casting traditions, able to create the same effect using
      multiple casting traditions.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> When you create a magical effect which could
      be created with multiple casting traditions, you may apply the boons and
      drawbacks of multiple casting traditions you are capable of creating the
      spell effect with. Spell points to power the effect can be drawn from any
      casting tradition which can be used to create the effect. For example, a
      character capable of using destructive blast using both the Blood Magic
      tradition and the Cholmic Traditionalist tradition could cast destructive
      blast in such a way that the Addictive Casting, Draining Casting, Extended
      Casting, Magical Signs, Painful Magic, Somatic Casting x2, and Verbal
      Casting drawbacks all take effect, but the Deathful Magic, Fortified
      Magic, Overcharge, and Overwhelming Power boons all take effect on the
      spell as well.</p>
