      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Mana sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you use an (expunge) talent on a
      creature that can use spells or sphere effects, you can spend an
      additional spell point to destabilize their magic, causing them to have a
      20% chance to trigger a wild magic event every time they use magic. The
      target gets a Will save against your Mana sphere DC to resist this effect,
      and it lasts for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability
      modifier. The chance to trigger a wild magic event increases by 10% per
      additional wild magic feat you possess, to a maximum chance of 60%.</p>

      <p>For information regarding wild magic events and the wild magic system,
      see <a href="/wild-magic">Wild Magic</a> by Drop Dead Studios.</p>
