      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere or Duelist sphere,
      character level 7th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Your body has grown a tolerance for the blood
      of others, and you have learned to use it to your advantage. You ignore
      any detriment from traversing on bloody terrain, such as difficult terrain
      or the terrain being considered slippery (as long as blood is the only
      reason that terrain is detrimental), and you gain a +2 bonus on all saving
      throws against bleed effects and any effect from the Blood sphere. You can
      distinctly tell the difference between the blood of any two creatures, and
      can identify the blood of creatures you have witnessed before. You can
      attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature by merely witnessing its
      blood, as if you had seen the creature by sight, but only if the blood was
      shed within an hour of you attempting to identify it.</p>
