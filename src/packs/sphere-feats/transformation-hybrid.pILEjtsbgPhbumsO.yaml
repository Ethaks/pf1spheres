      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Transformation.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When changing into a form granted by the
      Transformation feat, you may instead assume a hybrid form, blending your
      base form and your transformation form. This cannot be used if your
      transformation form is already similar to your base form, such as a
      humanoid using Anthropomorphic Transformation.</p>

      <p>When in hybrid form, you gain all limbs, natural attacks, special
      abilities, and movement modes from your transformation form, but without
      changing your basic shape nor melding your equipment. You may choose to
      retain limbs and movement speeds from your base form if your
      transformation form lacks them or has lesser versions, such as a humanoid
      keeping arms when assuming a hybrid form based on Serpentine
      Transformation or Vermin Transformation, adding legs to Aquan
      Transformation, or a winged creature retaining its wings under Animalistic
      Transformation.</p>

      <p>If your transformation would grant you additional legs, you may instead
      gain them as arms, although they do not grant any additional attacks, are
      not strong enough to gain any natural attacks, and may not assist in
      wielding weapons, activate magic items, or wield a shield. They may hold
      items and as a swift action you can use them to draw a sheathed or hidden
      weapon, don a shield, retrieve a stored item, load a crossbow, open a
      door, pick up an unattended item, sheathe or store an item, or take other
      non-offensive actions involving manipulating objects. Items do not
      automatically merge with the new form if it is capable of wearing them,
      but the size of the items does not change if they do not resize on their
      own.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Traits granted from the Improved
      Transformation feat apply to both your base transformation form and your
      hybrid form.</p>
