      "value": "<p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You are infused with the traits of something else other than just your being.</p>\n<p>You gain the Witchmarked general drawback (even if you are not a spherecaster) unless you already have it, using your Hit Dice as your caster level to determine its effects (if you are not a spherecaster a successful Knowledge (arcana) check successfully identifies the abilities from this feat rather then your spheres and caster level). You do not gain any bonus spell points from possessing the drawback gained exclusively from this feat.</p>\n<p>Choose one trait from the Blank Form ability of the Alteration sphere or another trait deemed appropriate to your witchmark by the GM. You may not select a trait that carries an additional spell point cost. You gain that trait as a permanent supernatural ability. This trait only functions while your witchmark traits are not suppressed (such as with the Hidden Heretic feat). Treat your Hit Dice as your caster level for the purposes of this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> The trait obtained this way counts towards the number of traits you may possess when under the effects of Blank Form, but is not considered a polymorph effect.</p>\n<p>You may only take this feat as a drawback feat if you already possess the Witchmarked drawback from your casting tradition. In which case you still gain the extra spell points (or boon) from the drawback, and substitute your magic skill bonus for your Hit Dice when calculating the abilities of this feat and may use your casting ability modifier for any effects that would require one, such as determining saving throw DCs.</p>\n",
