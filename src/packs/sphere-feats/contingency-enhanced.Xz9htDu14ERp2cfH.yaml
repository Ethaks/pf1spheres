      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere, Contingency.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may enhance a contingency effect. If the
      contingency creates or summons a valid target for that enhancement, the
      enhancement is transferred to that target. Otherwise, the enhancement is
      transferred to the sphere effect once it takes effect. You may spend an
      additional spell point when applying the enhancement to tie it into the
      contingency; if you do so, time spent prior to the contingency triggering
      does not count towards the enhancement&#8217;s duration.</p>
