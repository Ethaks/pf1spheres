      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Beastmastery sphere, (handle animal)
      package, Leadership sphere, (cohort) package.</p>

      <p>When you tame a creature or recruit a cohort, you may choose to have
      its Hit Dice count against both your tame and recruit limits. When doing
      so, the creature counts as both an animal ally and a cohort for the
      purpose of talents that grant actions to or are triggered by cohorts and
      animal allies.</p>
