      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Squadron Commander; or
      Warleader sphere, Troop Commander.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a swift action, you may spend a spell
      point or expend your martial focus to mentally communicate with the rest
      of your squadron the location of an enemy you have successfully damaged
      that turn. Until the beginning of your next turn, the target does not
      benefit from concealment or any form of stealth.</p>
