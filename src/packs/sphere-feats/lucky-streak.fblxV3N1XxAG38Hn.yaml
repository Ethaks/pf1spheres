      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When you successfully confirm a critical hit,
      you may spend a kismet point to make an extra attack at your highest base
      attack bonus as an immediate action. If this attack hits, increase its
      critical threat range by +1. This bonus is applied after abilities such
      Improved Critical or the keen weapon special ability and cannot be
      doubled.</p>
