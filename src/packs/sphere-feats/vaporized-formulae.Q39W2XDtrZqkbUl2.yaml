      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere ((formulae) package)</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can increase the Craft DC of a formulae
      by 10 to turn the formulae from a liquid to a gaseous state. A vaporized
      formulae that would require a Reflex save instead requires a Fortitude
      save, otherwise functioning as the original formulae. A formulae talent
      that can only be used on a single target (such as Panacea and Salve) can
      also be vaporized, allowing it to be thrown as a ranged touch attack with
      a range increment of 10 feet. Creatures within a 5-foot radius burst of
      the point of contact gain the benefits of the chosen formulae.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The 5-foot radius effect only applies to
      formulae that would normally affect a single target. Formulae that
      normally affect an area or multiple targets in an area have their radius
      unchanged when used with this feat.</p>
