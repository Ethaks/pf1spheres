      <p>Your magic shatters the ground, transforming into hazardous
      terrain.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Terrain Casting drawback.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Whenever you blight, corrupt, or drain an
      area of its nutrients with the Terrain Casting drawback, you may cause any
      affected area to become difficult terrain for all creatures other than
      yourself.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Defiler Feats:</strong> Creatures other than yourself
      moving through terrain you have defiled take 1d4 points of piercing damage
      for each 5 feet of movement through the spiked area.</p>
