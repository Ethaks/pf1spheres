      <p>Your strange magics bleed into the devices you forge.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Any item creation feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Any magic items that you craft share the
      benefits of boons that you possess. For example, you possess the Alien
      Source boon, creatures take penalties to counterspell the item and spell
      resistance against the item&#8217;s effects. Similarly, the item&#8217;s
      caster level would increase in specific weather conditions if you possess
      the Atmoturgy boon or when at least three creatures are already affected
      by the item if you possess the Draw Magic boon. Boons which apply negative
      conditions (such as Overcharge) or which are dependent upon certain
      factors of the user (such as Deathful Magic) consider the state of the
      creature using the effect rather than the item to determine effects. This
      feat cannot be used in conjunction with boons that require a specific
      drawback such as Fortified Casting.</p>
