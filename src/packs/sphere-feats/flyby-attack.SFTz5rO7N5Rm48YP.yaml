    value: >
      <p>This creature can make an attack before and after it moves while
      flying.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Fly speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When flying, the creature can take a move
      action and another standard action at any point during the move. The
      creature cannot take a second move action during a round when it makes a
      flyby attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Without this feat, the creature takes a
      standard action either before or after its move.</p>
