      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> While using the warming purr, you and allies
      within your purring aura gain 5 cold resistance. In addition, each
      creature benefiting from the warming purr deals an additional +1d6 fire
      damage on their first successful attack made each round. This attack must
      be one made with a manufactured weapon, natural attack, or unarmed
      strike.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Purring:</strong> The cold resistance granted by the
      warming purring increases to 15 and the additional fire damage increases
      to +2d6.</p>
