      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Martial focus.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can expend your martial focus as part of
      any single Will saving throw or concentration check you make. When you
      expend your martial focus in this manner, your saving throw or
      concentration check is treated as if you rolled a 13, similarly to taking
      10 on a skill check, except that the number you add to your saving throw
      or concentration check is 13.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as having Iron Will for the
      purposes of meeting prerequisites of feats.</p>
