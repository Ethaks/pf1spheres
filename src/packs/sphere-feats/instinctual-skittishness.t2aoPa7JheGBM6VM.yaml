      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Coy Caster.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You still do not like having others look at
      you while your casting, but you have enough self control to prevent them
      from looking. Whenever you use magic that would enable you to hide from
      creatures currently observing you either by enabling you to make a Stealth
      check to hide or making you better at hiding if the opportunity to hide
      already exists, you do not have to make a concentration check to produce
      the desired effect. This only prevents you from having to make
      concentration checks caused by your drawback, not concentration checks
      required from other reasons (like casting defensively).</p>

      <p>In addition you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks.</p>
