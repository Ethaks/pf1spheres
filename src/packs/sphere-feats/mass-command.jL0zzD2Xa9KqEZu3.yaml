      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, Squadron Commander; or
      Warleader sphere, Troop Commander, casting class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When using a sphere ability on a single
      creature in your squadron other than yourself, you may spend an additional
      spell point to target any number of creatures in your squadron. All
      squadron members must be within the range of the sphere ability. You must
      have line of sight and line of effect to affect them, and you may include
      yourself as a target. This cannot be used with sphere effects that do not
      have the option of being augmented by a (mass) talent. If the sphere
      ability has a duration greater than 1 hour, it is reduced to 1 hour.</p>
