      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Caster level 1st.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> This feat allows a creature to create
      spell-trigger items which casters can use as if they were their own sphere
      abilities. A creature must possess a spell engine&#8217;s base sphere, or
      else must activate the spell engine through the Use Magic Device
      skill.</p>

      <p>The most common form of spell engine is a wand; a handheld stick
      usually between 5 and 12 inches long that the caster points to direct the
      magic. However, a spell engine can take any form.</p>

      <p>A spell engine contains a limited amount of casting ability, which can
      be activated by the one wielding the spell engine as a standard action, as
      if the magic were their own. A spell engine possesses a base sphere, a
      caster level, and a small pool of spell points. The spell engine uses its
      own caster level and spell points to fuel its casting ability; under
      normal circumstances, a caster cannot spend their own spell points or use
      their own caster level when activating a spell engine. If a spell
      engine&#8217;s effects call for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 +
      1/2 the item&#8217;s caster level.</p>

      <p>Once per day, a caster whose caster level is at least equal to the
      spell engine&#8217;s caster level may spend one of their spell points to
      restore 1 spell point to the spell engine. A spell engine may only have
      one spell point per day restored in this fashion, regardless of how many
      casters attempt to do so.</p>

      <p>The simplest spell engine a crafter may create contains a base sphere,
      1 spell point, and a caster level of 2. This spell engine has a base price
      of 1,000 gp. When a crafter increases a spell engine&#8217;s caster level
      (to a maximum of their own), for every 2 caster levels a spell engine
      gains, the crafter may place an additional magic talent into the spell
      engine, or may increase the spell engine&#8217;s maximum spell point pool
      by 1. A crafter must possess each talent to be placed in the spell engine,
      or else must have access to that talent through another caster. Likewise,
      if a crafter possesses a sphere-specific drawback for the spell
      engine&#8217;s base sphere (or simply wants to create a focused spell
      engine), that spell engine also possesses that sphere-specific drawback,
      and gains either a bonus magic talent or a spell point in exchange.</p>

      <p>A spell engine may contain an advanced talent, but must possess that
      talent&#8217;s minimum caster level, as well as all of its prerequisite
      talents. A spell engine may be used to meet the prerequisites for creating
      other magic items.</p>

      <p>A spell engine&#8217;s pricing is determined by comparing it to Table:
      Spell Engine Pricing.</p>
