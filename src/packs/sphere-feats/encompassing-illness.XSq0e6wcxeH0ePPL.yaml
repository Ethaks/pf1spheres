    value: >
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere and 5th caster level; or
      Death sphere and 5th caster level; or Duelist sphere and base attack bonus
      +5; or Alchemy sphere and base attack bonus +5; Virulent Ailment,
      character level 9th.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Diseases you create through Plague feats
      become incredibly infectious. Created diseases can affect creatures that
      have immunity to diseases or Fortitude saves, although such creatures gain
      a +4 bonus to the saving throw (+8 if they possess no Constitution score).
      This allows your diseases to even infect constructs and other non-living
      creatures, although they cannot infect anything that does not have at
      least one Hit Dice.</p>
