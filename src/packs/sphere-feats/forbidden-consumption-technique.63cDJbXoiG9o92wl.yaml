      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Whenever you would expend martial focus, you
      may take 1 point of nonlethal damage per character level instead of
      expending your martial focus, to a limit of once per action. This damage
      cannot be healed by any means other than getting a full night&#8217;s
      rest, which removes all associated nonlethal damage. This nonlethal damage
      cannot be reduced or redirected, and a character incapable of taking
      nonlethal damage cannot use this feat.</p>
