      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Casting class feature.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When casting a sphere effect, you may
      increase the wild magic chance by 100% to add a single talent that you do
      not possess from one of the effect&#8217;s base spheres to the effect. For
      every 5 wild magic feats you possess, increase the number of talents
      gained this way by +1. You must still meet any prerequisites that the
      talents possesses. When gaining multiple talents with this feat, you may
      use a talent gained this way as a prerequisite for other gained
      talents.</p>
