      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You gain +1 spell point. You gain blindsense
      15 feet against bleeding creatures. If you pay 1 spell point as a swift
      action, you can afflict such creatures directly through their blood with
      ghost strikes for 1 round regardless of line of sight or effect. For each
      necrosis feat you possess beyond this one, increase the range of your
      blindsense against bleeding creatures by 15 feet and the duration when you
      spend a spell point by 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Four Necrosis Feats:</strong> When you spend 1 spell point as a
      swift action to activate this feat, you can affect bleeding creatures
      within the blindsense range granted by this feat with any talent that
      requires a touch attack, Fortitude save, or Will save regardless of
      distance, line of sight, or line of effect.</p>
