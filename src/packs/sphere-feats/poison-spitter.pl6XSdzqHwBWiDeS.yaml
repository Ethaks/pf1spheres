      <p>Flexing glands near your jaw, you can spit your poison directly at
      enemies in a foul corrosive mixture.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Poison eater alraun.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You can spit your poison as a ranged touch
      attack with a range increment of 10 feet. On a successful hit, it deals 1
      acid damage and delivers your poison. Spitting poison in this fashion is
      considered a ranged weapon for the purpose of feats and making multiple
      attacks per round.</p>
