      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Any Craft or Profession 5 ranks.</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Select one Craft or Profession skill in which
      you have at least 5 ranks. You gain a +2 bonus on your chosen Craft or
      Profession skill. You may use your ranks in this Craft or Profession skill
      as if it were your caster level and magic skill bonus when qualifying for
      item creation feats, and when determining how powerful of an enchantment
      you may place upon an item. Possessing this feat does not, however, grant
      you access to any magic spheres when determining which enchantments you
      may place upon an item. You must use your chosen Craft or Profession skill
      when creating a magic item, and cannot work with any item or material not
      related to your chosen skill.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This feat counts as, and does not stack with,
      the Master Craftsman feat, and may be selected in place of Master
      Craftsman whenever that feat is gained.</p>
