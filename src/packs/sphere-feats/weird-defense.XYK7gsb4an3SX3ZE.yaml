    value: >
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere (Blur (glamer), Decoy
      (glamer)).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> As a swift action, you may grant yourself a
      miss chance equal to 10% + 5% per 2 caster levels (maximum 95%) until the
      start of your next turn or until an attack misses due to this feat.
      Effects that ignore concealment only reduce this miss chance by half
      (rounded down). This is a spell-like ability. For abilities that allow for
      re-rolls for attacks that miss due to concealment such as the Blind-Fight
      feat, instead calculate the miss chance as 10% + 5% per 3 caster levels
      and reroll on a miss as per normal for the ability.</p>
