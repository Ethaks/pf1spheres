      “All men must follow, except for those who lead.”

      <p>Commanders are an essential component of any army, coordinating and
      organizing their troops. Oftentimes, the same skills that serve when
      leading an army are directly relevant to leading an adventuring group.
      Whether commanding legions or a handful of intrepid explorers, commanders
      are at their best when they have a stout-hearted group of comrades whose
      strengths they can leverage towards victory.</p>

      <p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp). In
      addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or
      less.</p>

      <p><strong>Starting Age:</strong> Self-taught</p>

      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Commanders are leaders who inspire and
      coordinate their allies, exhorting them to greater achievements.</p>

      <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Commanders can be of any alignment, but are
      typically lawful as their use of tactics and coordination favor an ordered
      mind.</p>

      <p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8</p>

      <p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> The commander&#8217;s class skills are
      Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),
      Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (engineering) (Int),
      Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local)
      (Int), Knowledge (nobility) (Int), Linguistics (Int), Perception (Wis),
      Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim
      (Str).</p>

      <p><strong>Skill Ranks Per Level:</strong> 6 + Int modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Commanders are proficient with simple
      weapons, as well as light armor and bucklers. In addition, if this is this
      character&#8217;s first level in any class, they may select a martial
      tradition of their choice.</p>


      <h2>Combat Training</h2>

      <p>A commander may combine combat spheres and talents to create powerful
      martial techniques. Commanders are considered Adept combatants and use the
      higher of their Charisma or Intelligence as their practitioner
      modifier.</p>
