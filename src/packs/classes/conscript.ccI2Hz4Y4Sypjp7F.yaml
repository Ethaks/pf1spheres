      “You know what they say, a spear in the hand is… Well, it’s a spear.
      Figure it out.”

      <p>Conscripts don&#8217;t choose a life of battle, they have it thrust
      upon by them by fate or circumstance. Regardless of how they come to the
      battlefield, all conscripts who leave it alive do so because of the same
      two reasons: they have a natural gift for battle, and they figured out how
      to make do with the tools they had.</p>

      <p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 1d6 x 10 gp (average 35 gp) In
      addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.
      <strong>Alternatively</strong>, a Conscript may start with 15 GP, an
      outfit worth 10 GP or less, a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and a suit of
      armor (the Conscript must be proficient with the weapons and armor
      chosen). (<a
      href="https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42bi5?Rules-Clarification-Scholar#14">Developer
      Suggestion</a>)</p>

      <p><strong>Starting Age:</strong> Self-taught</p>

      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Conscripts learn all of their combat training on
      the battlefield, and typically learn to fill whatever role best suits the
      equipment they have to work with.</p>

      <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any.</p>

      <p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d10</p>

      <p><strong>Class Skills:</strong> The conscript&#8217;s class skills are
      Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int),
      Perception (Wis), Profession (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and three
      other class skills of the conscript&#8217;s choice, chosen at character
      creation.</p>

      <p><strong>Skill Ranks Per Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier.</p>

      <p><strong>Proficiencies:</strong> Conscripts are proficient with simple
      weapons, as well as light armor and bucklers. In addition, if this is this
      character&#8217;s first level in any class, they may select a martial
      tradition of their choice.</p>


      <h2>Combat Training</h2>

      <p>A conscript may combine combat spheres and talents to create powerful
      martial techniques. Conscripts are considered Expert combatants. When they
      gain their first level in the conscript class, conscripts may choose
      either Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom as their practitioner
      modifier.</p>
