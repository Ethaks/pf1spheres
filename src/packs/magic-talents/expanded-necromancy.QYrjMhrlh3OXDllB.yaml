      <p>When you reanimate a creature you may reanimate it as a variant
      skeleton or zombie, such as a bloody skeleton, burning skeleton, fast
      zombie, or plague zombie. When reanimating a creature in this way, they
      count as twice their normal Hit Dice when casting the reanimate sphere
      effect, but once controlled, count normally against your Hit Dice
      limit.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a Death sphere caster level of 10 who
      gained this talent, the caster can reanimate and control a combined total
      of 20 Hit Dice of creatures. The largest creature the caster can reanimate
      is either a 20 Hit Dice skeleton or zombie or a 10 Hit Dice variant
      skeleton or zombie. A variant skeleton or zombie does not count as 20 Hit
      Dice for your Hit Dice limit, only for the initial casting of the
      reanimate sphere effect. Hit Dice multipliers are additive; an undead with
      two variants, such as a bloody burning skeleton, counts for three times
      its normal Hit Dice (x2 increasing to x3) for the purposes of
      reanimating.</p>
