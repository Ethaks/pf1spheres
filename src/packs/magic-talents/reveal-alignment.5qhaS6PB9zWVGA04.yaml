    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a consecration that reveals the
      alignment of all creatures inside it. While this consecration is in
      effect, the alignment of all creatures within the area is plain to any who
      observe them. How this manifests is unique to each observer&#8212;some
      might see a good creature with a halo and an evil creature with horns,
      while others might hear musical themes and chords evoking an
      alignment&#8212;but however it does the interpretation is unambiguous in
      the observer&#8217;s mind.</p>

      <p>An observer must still be able to sense a creature in order to discern
      its alignment. You must concentrate to maintain this consecration, but you
      may spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect to continue
      for 1 round per caster level without concentration.</p>
