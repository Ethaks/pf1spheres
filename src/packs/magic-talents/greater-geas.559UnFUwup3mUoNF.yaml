      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere (Geas (advanced)), caster
      level 10th.</p>

      <p>Your geas becomes more powerful. Targets of your geas no longer gain a
      saving throw against the effect, and you may target any creature, not only
      those with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level. In addition, the geas
      can only be broken through the Break Enchantment Life talent or the remove
      curse or break enchantment spells if the target&#8217;s caster level is at
      least two higher than yours. Limited wish, miracle, and wish may still
      remove a geas.</p>
