    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to teleport an unwilling creature as you
      can a willing creature. This requires a touch attack if done at touch
      range, the unwilling creature is allowed a Will saving throw to negate
      being teleported, and the effect is subject to spell resistance. An
      unwilling creature can only be teleported into open areas on solid
      surfaces (thus, they cannot be teleported into the air or into a solid
      object, and any such attempt instantly fails). In addition, they gain a +4
      bonus to their saving throw if the location would be directly harmful to
      them (onto a bed of spikes, etc.).</p>
