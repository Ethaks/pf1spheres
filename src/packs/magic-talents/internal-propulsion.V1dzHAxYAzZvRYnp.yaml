      <p>As a (quicken) ability, you can bolster a creature&#8217;s body and
      allow them to move swiftly. The target selects one of their movement
      speeds and gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to it, +5 feet per 5 caster
      levels you possess. As a free action, the target can change the selected
      movement speed once during their turn. If you spend an additional spell
      point when using this ability, you also grant the creature a fly speed of
      20 feet and average maneuverability for one minute. While this form of
      flight does not necessarily manifest as wings, it is considered winged
      flight for all purposes.</p>

      <p>As a (blood art), as a standard action or as a swift action if using
      this effect on a willing creature, you can cause a creature within range
      to suffer blood loss and move 10 feet in any one direction. This movement
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>An unwilling creature may attempt a Fortitude save to negate this
      effect, suffering no blood loss. The target gains a +4 bonus to their
      saving throw if they would be moved somewhere intrinsically harmful (onto
      a bed of spikes, into the air, etc.).</p>
