      <p>You may reach into a subject&#8217;s memory and remove information and
      awareness of people, places, things, or events.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> The target loses any recollection of
      what happened in the last round, back to the beginning of your previous
      round&#8217;s actions (Will negates). A reminder of the events, such as
      witnessing a similar action taken by one of the involved creatures or
      distinctive items being used in the same fashion or someone spending a
      free action to inform the person about the event, allows the target to
      attempt a new Will save to recall the forgotten moment, or the target may
      have their memory restored through the Life sphere&#8217;s Break
      Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, any effect that removes
      the confused condition, or the use of the Inception talent&#8217;s lesser,
      greater, or powerful charms being used to specifically make the target
      remember what was forgotten.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> The target loses all awareness of the
      immediate past (Will negates). This affects all memories from up to 1
      minute per caster level. Alternatively, a target may lose all memory of
      just a single person, location, item, or event, such as the identity of
      someone they talked to, or a robbery they participated in. No matter what
      in their memory is targeted, no more than 1 minute per caster level can be
      altered or removed from the target&#8217;s memory. A target&#8217;s memory
      may be restored through the Life sphere&#8217;s Break Enchantment talent,
      the break enchantment spell, or through the Inception talent&#8217;s
      greater or powerful charms being used to specifically make the target
      remember what was forgotten.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> The target loses all memory of events
      that transpired in the recent past (Will negates). This may erase memories
      going back 1 day per caster level. The caster may erase all or part of the
      subject&#8217;s memory of this time. A target&#8217;s memory may only be
      restored through the Life sphere&#8217;s Break Enchantment effect if the
      caster also possesses the Restore Senses talent, or through the miracle or
      wish spells. The target&#8217;s memory may also be replenished through the
      Inception talent&#8217;s powerful charm being used to specifically make
      the target remember what was forgotten.</p>
