      <p>You may create a link to a touched spot, object, or creature, allowing
      you to know the direction and distance to it. You know if the target is on
      another plane and whether that plane is coexistent, coterminous, or
      separate from the plane you are on, but you do not know their direction
      and distance if they are on another plane. If your target is unwilling,
      you must succeed on a melee touch attack (or a ranged touch attack with
      Ranged Warp) to create the link, and they are allowed a Will save to
      negate the effect. The link lasts for one hour per caster level. You may
      only maintain one link at a time, though you may spend a spell point to
      create a link that does not count against this limit. If you also possess
      Teleport Beacon, your beacons gain all the effects of this talent as if
      they were also links.</p>
