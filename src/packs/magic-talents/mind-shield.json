      "value": "<p>You may establish a ward on the mind of another, one capable of providing protection from mental assault.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You create a metaphysical bubble of protective insight over the mind of a willing creature. This bestows a morale bonus equal to 1 + 1/2 your caster level to mind-altering effects for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This mind shield is nullified as soon as the target attempts a single Will save vs. such an effect, whether or not the save was successful. This does not suppress or remove existing magical effects on creatures, it merely protects them from further mental attacks. This charm may be used multiple times per day on targets.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> You establish a notional cloud of ablative thought over the mind of a willing creature. This blur of ideological presence bestows a morale bonus to Will saves vs. mind-affecting effects equal to your caster level for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This mind shield is halved in effectiveness with each Will save made vs. such an effect, whether or not the save was successful. This does not suppress or remove existing magical effects on creatures, it merely protects them from further mental attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> You impart an adamant shield of conceptual certainty upon the mind of a willing creature. This creature gains immunity to any mind-altering spell or effect that would require a Will save for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This immunity can be overcome with a magic skill check against your MSD. Even if this immunity is bypassed, the target receives a bonus to saves against such effects equal to your caster level.</p>\n",
