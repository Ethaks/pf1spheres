    value: >
      <p>Your blot takes on a slick, nearly frictionless quality. Any creature
      attempting to move more than half their speed through the blot must
      attempt a Reflex save to avoid falling prone. If used as a (shadow) talent
      through Imbue Shadow, the target must also attempt a Reflex save to avoid
      dropping what is in its hands, and must spend a full-round action to
      retrieve stored or dropped items as they fumble with compromised grip, but
      gains a +10 bonus to CMD to avoid a grapple and on Escape Artist checks
      and CMB rolls made to escape a grapple.</p>
