      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Change Material
      (alter), Expanded Materials (material), Forge (alter)), caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>When using your Change Material talent, you may spend an additional
      spell point to make the change an instantaneous effect; the change is
      permanent and cannot be dispelled. If used on a target in conjunction with
      the Change Material and Fleshcraft talents, another application of the
      Fleshcraft and Change Material talents can return them to normal for a
      limited time, but only another use of the Permanent Change talent or the
      use of the Make Whole advanced Life talent can permanently reverse this
      effect. You cannot create a permanent change involving gems, precious
      metals (such as gold or silver) or rare metals (such as cold iron or
      mithril), unless you possess Costly Creation.</p>
