      <p>You cannot change the direction of the wind, but you may overpower it.
      If you wish to change the direction of the wind, you must create a new
      wind of the direction you desire. If the wind is the same severity as the
      natural wind, the winds negate (if they oppose) or join to create a wind
      with a direction halfway between the two. If one wind is smaller than the
      other, the smaller wind is negated in favor of the stronger one.</p>

      <p><strong>Light Wind:</strong> A gentle breeze, having little or no game
      effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Moderate Wind:</strong> A steady wind with a 50% chance of
      extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles.</p>

      <p><strong>Strong Wind:</strong> Gusts that automatically extinguish
      unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). Such gusts impose a
      &#8211;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on Perception checks.</p>

      <p><strong>Severe Wind:</strong> In addition to automatically
      extinguishing any unprotected flames, winds of this magnitude cause
      protected flames (such as those of lanterns) to dance wildly and have a
      50% chance of extinguishing these lights. Ranged weapon attacks and
      Perception checks are at a &#8211;4 penalty.</p>

      <p><strong>Windstorm:</strong> Powerful enough to bring down branches if
      not whole trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames
      and have a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames, such as those of
      lanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons
      have a &#8211;4 penalty on attack rolls. Perception checks that rely on
      sound are at a &#8211;8 penalty due to the howling of the wind.</p>

      <p><strong>Hurricane-Force Wind:</strong> All flames are extinguished.
      Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which have a
      &#8211;8 penalty on attack rolls). Perception checks based on sound are
      impossible: all characters can hear is the roaring of the wind.
      Hurricane-force winds often fell trees.</p>

      <p><strong>Tornado:</strong> All flames are extinguished. All ranged
      attacks are impossible (even with siege weapons), as are sound-based
      Perception checks. While natural winds of severity level 7 can result in a
      tornado, magically-altered winds of severity level 7 affects too small of
      an area to create this phenomenon. (Instead of being blown away [see
      Table: Wind], characters in close proximity to a tornado who fail their
      Fortitude saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact
      with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10
      rounds, taking 6d6 points of damage per round, before being violently
      expelled (falling damage might apply). While a tornado&#8217;s rotational
      speed can be as great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an
      average of 30 mph [roughly 250 feet per round]. A tornado uproots trees,
      destroys buildings, and causes similar forms of major destruction.)</p>

      <p>^ The siege weapon category includes ballista and catapult attacks as
      well as boulders tossed by giants.<br>

      ^^ <strong>Checked Size:</strong> Creatures of this size or smaller are
      unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed
      on a DC 10 Strength check (if on the ground) or a DC 20 Fly check if
      airborne.<br>

      ^^^ <strong>Blown Away Size:</strong> Creatures on the ground are knocked
      prone and rolled 1d4 &#215; 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage
      per 10 feet, unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check. Flying
      creatures are blown back 2d6 &#215; 10 feet and take 2d6 points of
      nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting, unless they succeed at a
      DC 25 Fly check.</p>

      <p><strong>Other Wind Effects</strong><br>

      <strong>Duststorm:</strong> When severity level 4 winds are created in a
      desert, it can create a duststorm, blowing fine grains of sand that
      obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected
      flames (50% chance). At severity level 5, a duststorm deals 1d3 points of
      nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without
      shelter and also poses a choking hazard (see Drowning, except that a
      character with a scarf or similar protection across her mouth and nose
      does not begin to choke until after a number of rounds equal to 10 + her
      Constitution score).</p>
