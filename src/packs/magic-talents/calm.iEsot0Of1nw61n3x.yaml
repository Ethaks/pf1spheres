      <p>You may suppress emotions in hostile creatures or provide ease to
      excitement and confidence. You may deny raging creatures their battles or
      joyous creatures their revelry.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> The target loses the benefit of any
      spell or effect with the emotion descriptor, as well as any morale bonus
      from magical or extraordinary effects (Will negates). This includes a
      paladin&#8217;s auras, the good hope spell, the effects of an
      eliciter&#8217;s emotions, bardic music, or a barbarian&#8217;s rage. The
      effects are suppressed, but not dispelled. This effect lasts a number of
      rounds equal to your caster level. Any aggressive action toward or damage
      dealt to a creature under the effect of this ability automatically ends
      the effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the
      lesser charm, this charm removes any desire to fight or engage in
      revelrous behavior. No violent actions or destructive actions may be taken
      by the creature, but the target may still defend itself normally. In
      addition, effects related to emotion that grant effects beyond simple
      bonuses (such as a bard&#8217;s fascinate ability or certain eliciter
      emotions) cannot be initiated (Will negates).</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the
      greater charm, the target of this ability simply loses any desire to act.
      The target is overwhelmed with soothing peace and calm and as such may
      take no actions, but the target may still defend itself normally (Will
      negates).</p>
