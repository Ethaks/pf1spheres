      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Forge (alter)), caster
      level 10th.</p>

      <p>When using your Forge talent, you may spend an additional spell point
      to produce items of great detail. You must succeed at the appropriate
      skill check to make complex items and work at a rate of 1 round per 10
      cubic feet when working in this manner. You can only work with a material
      which you can create.</p>
