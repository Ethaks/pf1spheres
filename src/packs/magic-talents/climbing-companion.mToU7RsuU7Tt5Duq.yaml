    value: >
      <p>Your companion may climb virtually any surface, no matter how slick or
      sheer. It can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse
      ceilings as well as a spider does. The companion must have at least 3
      limbs free to climb in this manner. The companion gains a climb speed of
      20 feet, including the +8 racial bonus on Climb checks from having a climb
      speed; furthermore, it need not attempt Climb checks to traverse a
      vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A companion climbing
      this way retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while
      climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it.
      It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing. If the companion
      already possesses a climb speed, it gains a +10 feet bonus to that climb
      speed.</p>
