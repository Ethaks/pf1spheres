    value: >
      <p>When you teleport a target you may change their orientation and lower
      their velocity. This allows you to turn the target up to 360 degrees,
      which lets you turn them during a charge or run action and either give or
      remove the prone condition, and cancel out momentum-based movement (such
      as falling, being thrown or pushed), which effectively resets any distance
      they have fallen. Using this talent to respond to actions or events
      outside of your turn typically requires a readied action.</p>

      <p>You may choose to apply only the effects of Isoport, changing a
      target&#8217;s spatial orientation and velocity without teleporting them
      to another location. Doing so reduces the casting time to a swift action
      instead of a standard action. If you also spend a spell point, you may
      Isoport a target as an immediate action. You must possess Unwilling
      Teleport to affect unwilling targets, and must spend a spell point as
      usual.</p>
