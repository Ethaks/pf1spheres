      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to divine for knowledge of the future. You
      gain useful advice in reply to one question regarding a specific goal,
      event, or activity to occur within 1 week. This advice could be a useful
      phrase or a cryptic omen or rhyme. If you do not act on the information,
      the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The
      base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a
      maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you receive no information and know
      the attempt failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at
      work. Multiple divinations about the same topic by the same caster use the
      same dice result as the first attempt and yield the same answer each
      time.</p>
