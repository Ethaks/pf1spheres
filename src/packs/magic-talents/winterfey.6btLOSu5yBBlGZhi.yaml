      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Cold Touch:</strong> Your natural attacks do cold damage
      instead of their normal damage type.</p>

      <p><strong>Icebeard:</strong> You become rimed in jagged ice (often taking
      the form of a jutting beard, but formations vary according to the caster),
      posing a serious threat to anyone attacking you in melee. An adjacent
      attacker must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d4 points of slashing
      damage when it succeeds on an attack roll against you. At 3rd caster
      level, this ability also deals 1d6 cold damage. This slashing damage
      increases by 1d4 at 6th caster level and every 6 caster levels thereafter
      and the cold damage by 1d6 at 9th caster level and every 9 caster levels
      thereafter. Additionally, you may break off sharp shards as a free action;
      treat these as daggers appropriate to your size. These shards melt at the
      end of your next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Icewalk:</strong> You may ignore difficult terrain, speed
      reductions, and penalties to Acrobatics imposed by naturally occurring
      snow and ice.</p>

      <p><strong>Lower Temperature:</strong> As a free action, you can lower the
      temperature in a 10-foot radius around your body by 1 step, +1 step per 10
      caster levels (see the Weather sphere for the effect of Cold). The
      temperature changes at a rate of 1 step per round. This change does not
      stack with that from other magic effects; if another effect is present in
      the area, you must succeed on a magic skill check against the
      effect&#8217;s MSD or be unable to alter the temperature. Additionally,
      you are unaffected by temperatures down to -50&#176;F (-45&#176;C).</p>

      <p><strong>Snowsight:</strong> You can see clearly through snow and sleet
      as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring miss chance from these
      obstructions, up to the normal limits of your vision.</p>
