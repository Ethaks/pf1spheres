    value: >
      <p>As a standard action you cloak the target in an aura of menacing shadow
      that conceals its appearance, subtle movements, and intentions behind a
      curtain of disconcerting murk. This dark aura hides distinguishing
      features from observers and grants a competence bonus of 1/2 your caster
      level to Bluff checks to lie or feint, as well as to Intimidation checks
      to demoralize. Sense Motive checks to get a hunch about Shadowed
      Mien&#8217;s target have their DC increased by your caster level. The
      target has no problem seeing out of Shadowed Mien, but the effect cannot
      be penetrated by darkvision. Clearsight and see in darkness allow the
      target of Shadowed Mien to be seen clearly, negating its bonuses against
      creatures with those abilities.</p>

      <p>Shadowed Mien lasts for as long as you concentrate or, if you spend one
      spell point at any time as a free action, ten minutes per caster
      level.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point as part of the action to
      initiate Shadowed Mien to grant substance to the shadowy aura. The target
      gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level for the
      duration of the effect. Exhausting these temporary hit points does not end
      the other effects of Shadowed Mien.</p>
