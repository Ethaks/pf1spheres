      <p>A rally is a magical effect you may enact as an immediate action,
      targeting a creature within the area of effect of one of your totems (or
      with whom you share a mandate, as detailed below), granting the target
      bonuses or allowing them to take certain actions. You must be within long
      range of a target to rally that target. If a rally targets a specific
      creature, it is subject to spell resistance.</p>

      <p>Some rallies can be used in response to other events, in which case the
      rally occurs before the triggering event completes, unless noted
      otherwise. Rallies that work from triggers can only be used when that
      trigger occurs, and can only affect those allies that the trigger applies
      to.</p>

      <p>When you gain the War sphere, you gain the following rally:</p>
