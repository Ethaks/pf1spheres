      <p>You may touch a target and spend a spell point to grant them the
      benefits of your bear spirit for 1 minute per caster level. The target
      gains the benefits of any (bearacteristic) talents you possess that apply
      whenever you are channeling a bear spirit, and you may spend spell points
      as normal to activate any bearacteristics with a duration. However, the
      target does not gain access to bearacteristics you possess that require an
      action to activate.</p>
