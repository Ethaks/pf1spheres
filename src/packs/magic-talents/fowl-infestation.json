      "value": "<p>You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that permanently curses the target to become plagued by chickens, ducks, or another similar bird of your choice (Will negates). Whenever the target draws a weapon or pulls an item out of a container, they have a 50% chance of drawing a live bird instead. The bird&#8217;s starting attitude toward the target is hostile, and will react appropriately to being drawn out by its ankles (or other part of its body). A bird&#8217;s body created by this effect disappears if it dies.</p>\n<p>If you spend an additional spell point when casting this sphere effect, the target always draws the same live bird, even if it was killed previously. Drawing this bird causes it to disappear from wherever it was and appear in the target&#8217;s hands. The bird remembers the target and will behave appropriately, usually becoming angrier with each draw. With enough time, some birds may realize peace was never an option.</p>\n",
