    value: >
      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Aridity of
      severity level 2 or higher, they can swim through sand as if it were water
      at a speed of 30 feet and gain tremorsense 30 feet (even if they stand on
      ground other than sand). They may breathe sand as if it were air. The
      speed and tremorsense range both increase by 5 feet per category above
      severity level 2.</p>

      <p>Unlike the effects of other (mantle) talents, if a creature bearing
      your mantle leaves an area of Aridity of severity level 2 or higher they
      retain the ability to swim through sand for a number of rounds equal to
      the last Aridity severity level they were in, but not the other effects of
      this talent.</p>
