      <p>Heat works very similarly to Cold. Hot environments can deal lethal or
      nonlethal fire damage to a creature. A creature dealt damage in this
      manner becomes fatigued (heatstroke), and cannot recover from fatigue or
      damage until cooled off (reaches shade, survives until nightfall, gets
      doused in water, and so forth). If a character takes an amount of
      nonlethal fire damage equal to her total hit points, any further damage
      from a hot environment is lethal fire damage.</p>

      <p>Characters in heavy clothing or armor take a -4 penalty on their saves
      against Heat. Creatures may use the Survival skill to gain bonuses to
      saving throws against Heat. Heat deals damage according to Table:
      Heat.</p>
