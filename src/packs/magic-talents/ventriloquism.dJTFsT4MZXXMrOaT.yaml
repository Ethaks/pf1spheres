      <p>As a free action once per round, you can make your voice (or any sound
      that you can normally make vocally) seem to issue from any location within
      medium range, or long range if you spend an additional spell point when
      activating this fey-blessing.</p>

      <p>You can speak in any language you know. Any sonic-based abilities
      granted by this sphere (such as those granted by Beckoning Call and
      Enchanting Music) can be used through this effect, counting the chosen
      location as your location for the purpose of determining area of effect.
      Anyone who hears the sound and rolls a successful Will save recognizes it
      as illusory (but still hears it, though may choose not to be affected by
      any abilities used as part of it).</p>
