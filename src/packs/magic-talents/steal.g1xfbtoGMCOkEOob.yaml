    value: >
      <p>You may use telekinesis on attended objects. You may perform a disarm
      or steal combat maneuver against a target using telekinesis, using your
      caster level plus your casting ability modifier as your CMB. You may use
      telekinesis to perform Sleight of Hand checks at a distance as well and
      may use your casting ability modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier
      for this purpose, but you also suffer a -5 penalty to the skill check and
      cannot take 10. If the maneuver or skill check is successful, you may move
      the lifted object up to your telekinesis distance in any direction, but
      may not use it as a Bludgeon as part of the same action.</p>
