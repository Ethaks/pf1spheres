      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Cheese Body:</strong> The target&#8217;s body becomes
      strengthened by artisanal aging techniques, gaining DR 5/slashing. This
      improves by 1 per 4 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Dangerously Cheesy:</strong> Whenever a creature damages the
      target with a melee attack, they are overwhelmed by the pungent smell of
      cheese. That creature is sickened for a number of rounds equal to your
      casting ability modifier unless they succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC
      equal to the caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC. The target gains a +1
      circumstance bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures sickened
      by this trait.</p>

      <p><strong>Spray Fondue:</strong> Once per minute, as a standard action
      the target may spray thick, hot, sticky cheese in a 20-foot cone. Any
      creature in this cone takes 1d4 points of fire damage per 2 caster levels
      and is entangled for 1d6 rounds unless they succeed at a Reflex save with
      a DC equal to the caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC. A creature that
      succeeds at its save takes half damage and is not entangled.</p>

      <p><strong>Holey:</strong> At 11th caster level, choose either the holy or
      unholy special ability. Any weapon the target wields gains that special
      ability. This trait costs an additional spell point.</p>
