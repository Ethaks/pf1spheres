      <p>Great diviners often learn a number of wide-reaching but imprecise
      tools which can map entire regions and battlefields, grant precise
      directions, and learn about the terrain.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>You gain a number of new (divine) abilities. The abilities granted by
      this talent are improved if you possess certain alternate divinations.
      These additional options are noted as expanded options. If you possess the
      Divination sphere Greater Divine talent, the range of the sphere effects
      granted by this advanced talent increase by 1 step (1 mile to 10 miles per
      caster level, 10 miles to 100 miles per caster level).</p>

      <h5 id="toc71"><span>Divine Chart</span></h5>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to divine a location within 1 mile per
      caster level, granting you vision of the specified location in up to a
      1,000-foot radius as though viewed with a map. You gain accurate knowledge
      of the terrain and topography, including buildings and other structures,
      although fine topographical features or concealed or hidden locations are
      not revealed. In addition, all normally visible creatures are located, but
      no identifying characteristics of those creatures are known, appearing as
      an indistinct speck. This effect does not reveal invisible or incorporeal
      creatures or give any information about the interiors of locations (such
      as buildings or caves). Only information as viewed from above is made
      known to the caster.</p>

      <p><strong>Expanded Options:</strong></p>

      <ul>

      <li>If you possess the Divine Allegiance alternate divination, obvious war
      camps and contingents of troops are also made known to the caster with a
      symbol of their banner (if they openly carry such a symbol).</li>

      <li>If you possess the Divine Illusions or Divine Force alternate
      divinations, the locations of invisible or incorporeal creatures are
      located respectively, as though detecting a normal creature.</li>

      <li>If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, the locations of
      extraplanar gates, teleportation circles, and other permanent magical
      teleportation effects are made known to the caster (although where they
      connect to is not revealed).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>This sphere effect is instantaneous and does not adjust for changes
      that occur after this effect is cast. When casting this sphere effect, a
      blank piece of parchment or other reasonably flat surface may be used as
      an optional focus component, the divined information is scribed as a
      readable map. Alternatively, a sufficiently large table with a malleable
      substance (such as clay or sand) or bowl of water or other liquid may be
      used to instead create a still model of the divined area, which crumbles
      if the table or bowl is disturbed.</p>

      <h5 id="toc72"><span>Lay of the Land</span></h5>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to divine the surrounding lands within up
      to 10 miles per caster level, extending underground and through objects
      without hindrance (unless you possess the Divination sphere Limited
      Penetration sphere-specific drawback). You instantly learn 2 facts + 1
      fact per 4 caster levels about any of the following information pertaining
      to the surrounding lands: terrain, plantlife, minerals, bodies of water,
      people and civilizations, animal populations, the presence of powerful and
      unnatural creatures, supernatural phenomenon and landmarks (such as ley
      lines, fairy rings, extraplanar portals, etc.), or even the general state
      of the natural area.</p>

      <p><strong>Expanded Options:</strong></p>

      <ul>

      <li>If you possess the Divine Elements alternate divination, you may learn
      1 additional fact about any element you could divine information for (such
      as air or water quality, active fires, etc.).</li>

      <li>If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, when you learn a
      fact about a nearby supernatural phenomenon, if that supernatural
      phenomenon is connected to another location by a permanent teleportation
      effect, you learn the type of plane or location it connects to (such as
      geographical traits, if the same plane, or planar traits if
      extraplanar).</li>

      <li>If you possess the Divine Weather alternate divination, you may learn
      1 additional fact about the weather in the area, including past weather
      patterns or an accurate forecast of the natural weather for the next day
      per caster level. This fact is only accurate to naturally occurring
      weather, not any magical occurrences which could change the weather.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>This sphere effect provides facts and information which can pertain to
      any relevant information about the surrounding lands, subject to GM
      discretion, but should generally be limited to the topography, natural
      features, and overall qualities about such information (such as total
      population numbers, locations of major natural bodies, categories of and
      presence of plant life or minerals, including rare resources, general
      locations of animals or unnatural creatures, etc.). This sphere effect
      does not provide precise information about the nature of communities,
      signs of civilization, or constructed locations, but may reveal their
      general locations (such as knowing there is something man-made and
      constructed located inside a mountain, but not being aware of the nature
      of the construction, such as being a dungeon, shrine, or tower).</p>

      <h5 id="toc73"><span>Pathfinder</span></h5>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to divine the shortest, most direct
      physical route to a prominent and specific destination, such as a castle,
      city, lake, crypt, or dungeon. The destination can be outdoors or
      underground as long as it is prominent. If no specific destination is
      named (such as &#8220;a nearby lake&#8221; or &#8220;the nearest
      city&#8221;, instead of &#8220;Fort Lotheed&#8221;), this sphere effect
      locates the nearest destination which meets the description (subject to GM
      discretion). This sphere effect has no maximum range, but is limited to a
      destination on the same plane as the caster. This sphere effect is blocked
      by effects which protect against scrying and other forms of divination
      (such as not locating a dungeon which is warded against divination
      effects).</p>

      <p><strong>Expanded Options:</strong></p>

      <ul>

      <li>If you possess the Divine Warp alternate divination, you may designate
      an extraplanar gate, teleportation circle, and other permanent magical
      teleportation effect leading to a specific plane as your destination. If
      no such effect exists, this ability fails and grants no directions.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>For 1 day per caster level, the caster gains knowledge of the
      destination&#8217;s general location and the destination&#8217;s distance
      and direction from the caster. In addition, the caster gains a
      supernatural sense for any actions which must be taken to reach that
      destination (such as which corridor in a cavern to take). This sphere
      effect otherwise functions as the find the path spell for the purposes of
      interactions with the maze spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Pathfinder Example:</strong> The caster could not specify a
      specific cabin or home, but could specify the specific logging camp where
      the structure is located (such as &#8220;The Maple Forest Logging
      Camp&#8221;). Subject to GM discretion, sufficiently prominent individual
      buildings (such as landmarks or a noble&#8217;s mansion) may qualify as a
      prominent destination if it is notable or unique to the location.</p>
