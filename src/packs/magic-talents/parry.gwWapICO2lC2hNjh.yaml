      <p>You may use the Catch function of telekinesis to block attacks with
      melee weapons, though they retain their hold on their weapon even if you
      successfully block their attack. However, if you possess the Steal talent
      as well, you may immediately use it on that weapon as part of a successful
      Catch. Your telekinesis must be specially tuned towards the task, so when
      you ready an action to Catch (or when you spend a spell point on the catch
      field option of the Quick Reactions talent, if you possess it) you must
      specify whether your telekinesis can intercept melee or ranged
      attacks.</p>
