      "value": "<p>You gain a competence bonus on Craft checks equal to your caster level for items primarily composed of wood and may craft such objects as if you had the appropriate tools.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to turn an adequately sized piece of wood (including wood from a living plant) into 50 pieces of ammunition, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or a weapon normally primarily composed of wood. A weapon that normally would have a metal head, spike, or blade has its damage die reduced by one size. You must succeed on the appropriate Craft check to make the chosen item as part of this action or else the item gains the broken condition, though you may attempt to shape it again. The item is considered masterwork and, if a weapon or suit of armor, gains an enhancement bonus equal to your caster level/5 (minimum 0).</p>\n<p>Equipment made this way returns to its original form when your fey-link ends. Using special types of wood imparts the properties of that wood to the shaped object. If using wood from a living plant, the plant takes damage equal to the hit points of the item (before enhancement), ignoring hardness and dealing full damage to objects, which can be restored by putting the item back in place and dismissing the effect as a standard action. If an entire plant was used, it may be planted in a suitable location and the effect dismissed.</p>\n<p>You can spend a spell point as a standard action to restore 1d6 + caster level hit points to an object made primarily of wood or to a creature of the plant type.</p>\n",
