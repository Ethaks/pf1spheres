      <p>You can make a melee touch attack against a living creature up to your
      size to attempt to absorb it into your body, similar to the swallow whole
      ability (Reflex negates).</p>

      <p>Being absorbed causes a creature to take negative energy damage each
      round equal to 1d6 + 1d6 for every three caster levels you have (undead
      are not affected). An absorbed creature gains the grappled condition,
      while you do not. An absorbed creature can try to cut its way free with
      any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage
      required to get free is equal to 1/10 your total hit points), or it can
      just try to escape as if escaping a grapple (using your CMD or your MSD,
      whichever is higher). The armor class of your interior is 10 + 1/2 your
      caster level, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If an absorbed
      creature cuts its way out, you cannot use this talent again until the
      damage is healed.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can touch a corpse or undead that you control as a
      move action to absorb it into your body or to expel an absorbed corpse or
      undead into an adjacent square. While absorbed, an undead cannot use any
      of its senses or take any actions, and time passes normally - corpses rot
      and reanimate&#8217;s duration continues to pass.</p>

      <p>You can have a number of corpses or controlled undead absorbed at a
      time equal to 1 plus 1 for every 3 caster levels you have. You can spend a
      spell point to expel all absorbed corpses and undead with a single swift
      action. While you have at least one undead absorbed, you give off an aura
      that can be detected by Divine Undead equal to the highest Hit Dice undead
      absorbed, but your appearance is not otherwise changed.</p>

      <p>Creatures and bodies storied within your tomb of flesh are stored in an
      extradimensional space; you do not increase in size no matter how many
      creatures and bodies are stored inside you.</p>
