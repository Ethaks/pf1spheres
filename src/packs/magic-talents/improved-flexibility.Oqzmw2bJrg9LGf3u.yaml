    value: >
      <p>You may enhance a creature, allowing it to attempt Escape Artist checks
      that normally require a full minute to perform as a full-round action, and
      that normally take a full-round action as a standard action. At 6th caster
      level, it ignores all penalties while squeezing through narrow spaces, and
      may move through such spaces at full speed. At 12th caster level, it may
      squeeze through tight spaces at its full speed, and does not lose its
      Dexterity bonus to AC when doing so. At 18th level, it may use Escape
      Artist to squeeze through any space large enough to fit one of its
      fists.</p>
