      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>Any magical effect which would detect lies or force to speak the truth
      requires a magical skill check to affect the target. Failure means the
      effect does not detect your target&#8217;s lies or force it to speak only
      the truth. In addition, you may force the creature to speak only lies;
      this word is only a [curse] effect if you do. Unless the target succeeds
      on a Will saving throw, they cannot speak the truth as they understand it.
      They are always aware of this word being placed on them and the caster
      always knows if the target made its saving throw. An affected target may
      still be evasive, refuse to answer, or word their responses carefully.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point to grant the target a bonus to
      Bluff checks equal to +5 plus your caster level. This bonus only applies
      to checks made to convince another of the truth of the target&#8217;s
      words. It does not apply to other uses of the Bluff skill, such as
      feinting in combat, creating a diversion to hide, or communicating a
      hidden message via innuendo.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend
      a spell point to allow the effect to endure for 1 minute per caster level
      without concentration.</p>
