      <p>When you reanimate a corpse or corpses, they remain for 1 hour per
      caster level instead of 1 minute per caster level. You may reanimate a
      single corpse as a sustained undead without spending a spell point, but
      the duration of the reanimate effect is changed to
      &#8216;concentration&#8217;. A sustained undead only counts as half their
      Hit Dice (rounded up, minimum 1) against the total amount you may have
      reanimated at once. You can never have more than 1 sustained undead.</p>

      Reanimation; any references to those refer to this talent.</p>
