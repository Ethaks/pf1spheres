      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Discern Individual
      (sense)), caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>You may divine the presence of individual auras. When divining in a
      location, you sense which creatures have recently been in that area. This
      does not reveal any information about those creatures other than the
      strength of their aura, but each aura possesses a unique signature; if you
      sense the same creature more than once, you can easily connect that they
      are the same creature.</p>

      <p>It is also possible for someone to adopt an alias, as the same aura is
      detected multiple places, but may be more difficult to identify as the
      same person. If you possess a secret identity, such as with the vigilante
      class or in another way with GM approval, your secret identity and primary
      identity will detect as different people.</p>

      <p><strong>Vigilantes, Fugitives, and Divine Identity:</strong> While it
      is very easy to identify lower level creatures individually, their auras
      do not last very long, which is why many petty thieves can go undetected,
      even in settlements that have access to this ability. However, thieves of
      great skill or renown can quickly become easy to spot, becoming
      celebrities in their own right as their deeds are easily identified, even
      if they themselves are difficult to capture.</p>
