      <p>You can cause the bodies you control to respond in gruesome and
      disgusting manners.</p>

      <p>As a (still), you can cause a creature under your blood control to
      develop cysts and engorged pustules across their body. When another
      creature confirms a critical threat against your target, one of these
      cysts bursts. When a cyst bursts, the target immediately suffers damage
      equal to your blood loss, and any adjacent enemies are exposed to a single
      disease the target is suffering from (of your choice), and must
      immediately succeed at a save against that disease or become afflicted by
      it.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If using the optional ruleset for Called Shots,
      any creature can attempt to burst a cyst by making an easy called
      shot.</p>

      <p>As a (blood art), you can cause a single creature within range to
      suffer blood loss and suddenly manifest a large cyst, which immediately
      bursts. Creatures adjacent to your target must attempt a saving throw
      against any diseases your target was suffering from. If your target was
      suffering from a disease, they must succeed at a Fortitude save or else be
      overwhelmed and disoriented by pain. On a failed saving throw, the target
      is sickened for 1 round and suffers 1d10 damage, plus an additional 1d10
      damage per 5 caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> When you expel a disease with the Manipulate
      Health talent, you can deal blood loss to the creature to cause any
      creature within 5 feet of them to attempt a save against the disease.</p>
