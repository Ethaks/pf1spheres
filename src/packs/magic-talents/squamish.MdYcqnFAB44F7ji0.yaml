    value: >
      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, creating a constant strong
      wind that pushes the target back. When you place this shroud on the
      target, choose a direction for the wind to blow from. Each round this
      shroud makes a bull rush attempt from this direction against the target.
      Your CMB for this check is equal to your caster level + your casting
      ability modifier.</p>
