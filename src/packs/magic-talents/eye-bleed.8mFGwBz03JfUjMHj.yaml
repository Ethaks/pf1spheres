    value: >
      <p>When using the Bleed ability, you may increase the target&#8217;s blood
      pressure, rupturing vessels in the affected creature&#8217;s eyes for the
      duration of the bleed damage. The creature suffers a 20% miss chance from
      concealment against all creatures for the duration of the bleed damage. If
      you spend an additional spell point, the creature is instead blinded for
      the duration of the bleed damage as blood streams from around its eyes.
      Creature&#8217;s without eyes or equivalent sensory organs are immune to
      this effect.</p>
