    value: >
      <p>Whenever you succeed a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect,
      you may spend 1 spell point as a free action that can be taken outside of
      your turn to terrify the source of that effect, provided you can identify
      and see the effect&#8217;s source.</p>

      <p>This causes the creature to be shakened for 1 round per caster level. A
      successful Will save negates this effect. At 10th caster level, the
      creature is instead frightened for 1 round per caster level, and on a
      successful save the creature is still shaken for one round per caster
      level. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you may spend 1 spell point as a standard action to ready
      your mind, and grant yourself a +2 morale bonus to all saving throws made
      against mind-affecting effects for the next 24 hours. This bonus is
      doubled against fear effects. This bonus increases by +1 at 8th caster
      level and every 8 levels thereafter.</p>
