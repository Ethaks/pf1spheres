      <p>When creating a glamer on a target you may have the target use their
      action to maintain concentration of the glamer instead of yourself. In all
      other ways the glamer still behaves as if cast by you. You may only have
      one creature concentrating in your place at any time. The number of
      creatures that can simultaneously concentrate in your place improves by an
      additional 1 per 10 caster levels.</p>
