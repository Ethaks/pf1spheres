      <p>Your glows may be composed of multiple colors, allowing you to outline
      or highlight specific portions of a glowing object or create art. When you
      cause your glow to shed light, you may also create patterns and different
      colors in the light it sheds, casting intricate designs on surfaces. These
      patterns may be highly detailed and complex, though creating art of high
      craftsmanship requires you to succeed on an appropriate Craft check,
      usually Craft (painting). You determine and create the pattern as part of
      making the glow or light, but may change it as a free action once per
      turn.</p>

      <p>As a standard action you can cause one of your glows that is shedding
      light to stain a surface with its light, painting its current pattern on
      any portion of the glow&#8217;s area. The ability to stain a surface is an
      instantaneous effect, so the resulting stain is non-magical and functions
      as a mundane dye that cannot be dispelled, though it may be cleaned off or
      painted over. Unwilling targets may attempt a Reflex save to avoid being
      stained, and a 5-foot cube may be cleaned of these stains with a full
      minute of work.</p>

      <p>If you also possess the Dancing Lights talent, you may alter the shape
      and appearance of your light. It may be as large as a full 5-foot cube, or
      as small as a mote of dust, though its size has no impact on the light it
      sheds. Regardless of how intricate or well shaped your Dancing Light is,
      it is impossible to mistake as anything other than a magical light.</p>
