    value: >
      <p>You may enhance a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or as many as 50
      pieces of ammunition grouped together (in the same container or quiver),
      granting it a +1 enhancement bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4
      caster levels possessed (maximum +5). This does not stack with any
      enhancement bonus already possessed by the item.</p>

      <p>Some talents are marked (enhance). These talents grant you new
