      <p>You may fill an area with the influence of an alignment type you are
      connected to (good, evil, lawful, or chaotic). You must possess this
      alignment type. Creatures of that alignment&#8217;s opposite (good for
      evil, lawful for chaotic, etc.) within this area suffer one of the
      following detriments, chosen at random (Fortitude negates):</p>

      <ol>

      <li>blind 1 round</li>

      <li>deaf 2d4 rounds</li>

      <li>staggered 1d4 rounds</li>

      <li>sickened 1d4 rounds</li>

      <li>dazed 1 round</li>

      <li>shaken 1d4 rounds</li>

      </ol>

      <p>As this power is cosmic in origin, it can affect undead, even though
      undead are usually immune to some of these conditions.</p>

      <p>If you are true neutral, you may choose neutrality with this
      consecration, in which case all creatures at the extremes of the alignment
      spectrum (chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good) suffer
      the ill effects. This is an instantaneous effect.</p>
