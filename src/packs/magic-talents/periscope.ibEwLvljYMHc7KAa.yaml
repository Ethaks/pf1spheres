      <p>By altering the path of light you can see from unusual positions. You
      may place and see from a sensor in any unoccupied space within your glow
      range that you can draw an unobstructed line to. You may see from the
      position of the sensor as if you stood in the space it occupies, and may
      shift your perspective to or from that sensor as a free action. These
      sensors can be detected (Perception DC 20 + your caster level) and
      dispelled.</p>
