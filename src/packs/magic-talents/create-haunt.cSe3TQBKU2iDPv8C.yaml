      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Haunting Apparition),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 1 minute and 5 spell points to create a haunt with a CR
      equal to or less than 1/2 your Death sphere caster level. These haunts
      share your alignment. Haunts created through this talent have a
      destruction condition of being successfully affected with the Break
      Enchantment talent from the Life sphere or other effects that would
      counter a curse.</p>
