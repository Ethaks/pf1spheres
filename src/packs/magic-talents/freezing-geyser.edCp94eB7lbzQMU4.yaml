      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((fire) and (water)
      package, Create Nature (geomancing), Temperature (fire, geomancing)),
      caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>This creates a burst of boiling water that snap-freezes once it has
      covered its targets. As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell
      points to create an eruption coming from a 10- foot square of solid ground
      within range. This deals 1d6 fire damage per caster level per round to all
      creatures within the 10-foot square and up to 30 feet above it. A
      successful Reflex save halves the damage, but creatures with evasion still
      suffer 3d6 fire damage on a successful save.</p>

      <p>Starting in the second round of the geyser&#8217;s eruption, the
      rapidly cooling water begins raining down on all targets within 30 feet of
      the geyser, lasting for the length of the effect +1d3 rounds. Any creature
      caught in this freezing downpour takes 10d6 points of cold damage each
      round and is entangled by the layer of frost and ice forming on it. Even
      creatures affected by the main geyser who failed their Reflex save but
      left the area of cold rain find themselves entangled as the water on them
      freezes.</p>

      <p>A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the entangled
      condition, but still deals 2d6 cold damage to creatures with evasion who
      successfully save. While a creature outside the affected area finds their
      entangled condition leaves after 1 round as the ice melts, creatures who
      remain within the affected area are affected each round, with each
      additional failed save causing its speed to be reduced by 10 feet. If the
      creature&#8217;s speed reaches 0 feet, it is completely encased in ice, as
      the (water) package geomancing ability, with ice thickness determined as
      usual for the caster. At this point the creature continues taking damage
      from the freezing water&#8212;automatically failing any saving
      throws&#8212;plus an additional 3d6 points of cold damage each round until
      freed from the ice.</p>

      <p>If an entangled creature steps into the burning geyser, they suffer
      fire damage as normal and are no longer entangled, as the boiling water
      melts the ice.</p>
