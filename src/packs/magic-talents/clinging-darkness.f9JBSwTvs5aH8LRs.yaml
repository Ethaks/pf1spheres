      <p>You may center an area of darkness or blot on a creature or item rather
      than an area, causing it to cling to and move with that creature or item.
      If targeting a creature or its attended item, it is subject to spell
      resistance and that creature may attempt a Will save to negate the effect
      initially and again each round at the end of its turn. A successful save
      ends the darkness or blot immediately.</p>
