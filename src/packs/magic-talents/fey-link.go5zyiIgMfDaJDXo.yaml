      <p>As a swift action, you change your creature type to fey for 1 minute
      per caster level. You are treated as a fey and no longer count as your
      previous creature type for all purposes including spells, magic items,
      etc., but you do not gain any of the benefits of the fey type or lose the
      benefits of your previous creature type, and still possess any subtypes
      you previously possessed (thus, an elf using this ability would be treated
      as a fey with the elf subtype).</p>

      <p>Whenever fey-link is active, you may spend 1 spell point as a free
      action to gain the benefits of a fey-blessing until the end of the
      fey-link. There is no limit to the number of fey-blessings you may have
      active at a time, but each one must be activated separately, and all only
      endure until the end of the fey-link. Renewing a fey-link does not
      increase the duration of a fey-blessing, and ends all fey-blessings you
      currently possess.</p>

      <p>When you gain the Fallen Fey sphere, you gain the following
      fey-blessing:</p>
