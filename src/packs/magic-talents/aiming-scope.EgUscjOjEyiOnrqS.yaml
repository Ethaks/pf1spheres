      <p>The target of this lens fires with more precision. They treat targets
      of their ranged attacks as being one range increment closer for all
      effects, such as when determining penalties for firing at a longer range.
      In addition, they gain a +1 competence bonus to all ranged attack
      rolls.</p>

      <p>For every ten caster levels you possess, the target ignores an
      additional range increment and their competence bonus to ranged attack
      rolls increases by 1.</p>
