    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you may pretend to cast an Illusion sphere effect
      and attempt a Bluff check. Making a Bluff check in this manner does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as casting a spell. Any
      creature observing you must attempt a Sense Motive or Spellcraft check
      (whichever skill that target has a higher bonus with) against a DC equal
      to your Bluff check or be convinced you cast an illusion. For the next 10
      minutes, the next time a creature who failed its check would make a saving
      throw against one of your illusions, they must roll twice and take the
      lower result. For every 8 caster levels you possess, creatures must roll
      twice on an additional saving throw against your illusions during this
      duration. Creatures who succeed at their check know you were bluffing and
      are unaffected.</p>

      <p>This is an extraordinary effect; you can only attempt to deceive the
      same creature with this talent once every 24 hours.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If it would be impossible for the caster to cast
      magic, such as while in an anti-magic field, creatures automatically
      succeed their Sense Motive or Spellcraft check to see through your
      deception.</p>
