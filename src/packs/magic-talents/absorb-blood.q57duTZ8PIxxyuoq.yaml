    value: >
      <p>When a creature within blood control range takes bleed damage to their
      hit points, as a free action that may be taken even when it is not your
      turn you may choose a different creature under the effects of your blood
      control to gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to the bleed
      damage taken by the first creature. These temporary hit points last for 1
      minute per caster level. Each creature may only provide temporary hit
      points to one other creature.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to inflict 1d2 points
      of Constitution damage to a creature under the effects of your blood
      control, then choose a different creature under the effects of your blood
      control to heal a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the first
      creature times the amount of Constitution damage dealt. If you possess
      Mass Blood Magic, you may spend an additional spell point as per that
      talent to inflict the Constitution damage on multiple creatures and heal
      multiple creatures. The total number of affected creatures cannot exceed
      your Mass Blood Magic limit and no creature can be targeted by the
      Constitution damage more than once per round. A single creature can be
      healed multiple times.</p>
