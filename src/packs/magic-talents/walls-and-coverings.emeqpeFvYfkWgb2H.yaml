      <p>When creating walls, coverings, or other objects that are particularly
      thin but cover a large area, a section of 20-foot-by-20-foot cloth is
      considered a Small object (1 hit point), while a wall 10-foot-by-10-foot
      and 1 inch thick counts as a Small object. Adding spikes or other such
      decorations to a 10-foot-by-10-foot wall makes it count as a Medium
      object, and doubling the thickness of a wall or covering counts as
      doubling its size. When dropping a wall or covering onto an area, damage
      is dealt to all spaces the wall or covering strikes, but damage is
      determined by the thickness, rather than the overall size, of the object
      (dropping a spikeless wall 1-inch thick onto a target counts as striking
      them with a Small object, no matter how large the wall may actually be in
      total). Additionally, you cannot target specific creatures with a wall or
      covering; only splash damage can be dealt over the affected area.
      Coverings made of soft materials such as cloth dropped less than 30 feet
      do not deal damage.</p>
