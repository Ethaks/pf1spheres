      "value": "<p>Your glows may be composed of multiple colors, allowing you to outline or highlight specific portions of a glowing object or create art. When you cause your glow to shed light, you may also create patterns and different colors in the light it sheds, casting intricate designs on surfaces. These patterns may be highly detailed and complex, though creating art of high craftsmanship requires you to succeed on an appropriate Craft check, usually Craft (painting). You determine and create the pattern as part of making the glow or light, but may change it as a free action once per turn.</p>\n<p>As a standard action you can cause one of your glows that is shedding light to stain a surface with its light, painting its current pattern on any portion of the glow&#8217;s area. The ability to stain a surface is an instantaneous effect, so the resulting stain is non-magical and functions as a mundane dye that cannot be dispelled, though it may be cleaned off or painted over. Unwilling targets may attempt a Reflex save to avoid being stained, and a 5-foot cube may be cleaned of these stains with a full minute of work.</p>\n<p>If you also possess the Dancing Lights talent, you may alter the shape and appearance of your light. It may be as large as a full 5-foot cube, or as small as a mote of dust, though its size has no impact on the light it sheds. Regardless of how intricate or well shaped your Dancing Light is, it is impossible to mistake as anything other than a magical light.</p>\n",
