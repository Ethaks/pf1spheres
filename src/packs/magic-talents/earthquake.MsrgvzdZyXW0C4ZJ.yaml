      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((earth) package,
      Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>As an instantaneous effect, you may spend 3 spell points to create an
      earthquake, affecting an 80-foot radius area. The powerful shockwave
      created by this ability knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens
      cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which
      time creatures on the ground cannot move or attack. A caster on the ground
      must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 the caster level) or
      lose any spell or sphere effect they try to cast. The earthquake affects
      all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The
      specific effect of an earthquake depends on the nature of the terrain
      where it is created.</p>

      <p><strong>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:</strong> The roof collapses, dealing
      8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC
      15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An
      earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger
      those outside the actual area who are below the falling debris and
      rubble.</p>

      <p><strong>Cliffs:</strong> The earthquake causes cliffs to crumble,
      creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls
      vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see
      below).</p>

      <p><strong>Open Ground:</strong> Each creature standing in the area must
      succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth
      and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex
      DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of
      the earthquake, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if
      they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see
      Suffocation rules in Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide for more details).</p>

      <p><strong>Structure:</strong> Any structure standing on open ground takes
      100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry
      building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
      Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to
      objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure
      takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned
      beneath the rubble (see below).</p>

      <p><strong>River, Lake, or Marsh:</strong> Fissures open under the water,
      draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy
      marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of this effect,
      sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must
      succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand.
      After the earthquake ends, the rest of the body of water rushes in to
      replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p>

      <p><strong>Pinned Beneath Rubble:</strong> Any creature pinned beneath
      rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a
      pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must attempt a DC 15
      Constitution check each minute thereafter until freed or dead, suffering
      1d6 points of lethal damage for each failed save.</p>
