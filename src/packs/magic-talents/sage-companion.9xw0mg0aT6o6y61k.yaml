      <p>Your companion&#8217;s Intelligence increases by 2, +1 per 2 Hit Dice
      and gains a bonus on skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses
      of creatures equal to half its Hit Dice (minimum 1). This increase stacks
      with the Skillful Companion talent. Your companion gains additional skill
      points from this increased Intelligence as usual.</p>
