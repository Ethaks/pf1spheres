      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms. A single form cannot
      possess traits that grant opposed subtypes (for example, a target cannot
      possess both the Celestial Form and Fiendish Form traits), and some traits
      have specific requirements before they can be granted to a target.</p>

      <p><strong>Anarchic Form:</strong> The target gains the chaotic subtype,
      and gains a chaotic outsider&#8217;s aura for the purpose of detecting
      alignment. The target gains DR 2/lawful, which improves by +1 per 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Axiomatic Form:</strong> The target gains the lawful subtype,
      and gains a lawful outsider&#8217;s aura for the purpose of detecting
      alignment. The target gains DR 2/chaos, which improves by +1 per 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Celestial Form:</strong> The target gains the good subtype, and
      gains a good outsider&#8217;s aura for the purpose of detecting alignment.
      The target gains DR 2/evil, which improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Fiendish Form:</strong> The target gains the evil subtype, and
      gains an evil outsider&#8217;s aura of the purpose of detecting alignment.
      The target gains DR 2/good, which improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Angel Body:</strong> (Requires good subtype) The target gains a
      protective aura as a supernatural ability. The target and all creatures
      within 20 feet gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus
      on saving throws, but only against attacks and effects that originate from
      evil creatures. These bonuses increase by +1 per 5 caster levels you
      possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Daemon Body:</strong> (Requires evil subtype) The target
      festers with disease as a supernatural ability. Choose one natural attack
      the target possesses. When the target successfully strikes a creature with
      that natural attack, that creature must pass a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2
      Hit Dice + Constitution modifier) or be inflicted with the fleshweep
      disease (injury; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1 Con damage and
      1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves).</p>

      <p><strong>Inevitable Body:</strong> (Requires lawful subtype) The target
      counts as both its own creature type and a construct, such as when
      determining what magic can affect it. The target gains a +2 racial bonus
      to all Fortitude saves, except against effects that also work on objects.
      This bonus increases by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Protean Body:</strong> (Requires chaotic subtype) The target
      becomes supernaturally resistant to blockage. The target gains a +2 racial
      bonus to all saving throws vs. paralysis and the entangled or stunned
      conditions. This bonus increases by +1 per 5 caster levels. The target
      also gains a racial bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level to Escape Artist
      checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple or pin.</p>
