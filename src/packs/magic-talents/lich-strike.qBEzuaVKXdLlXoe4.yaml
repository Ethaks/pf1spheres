      <p>You may make a ghost strike that emulates the power of a lich&#8217;s
      touch, incapacitating the target. The target is staggered for 1 round plus
      1 round per 4 caster levels (Fortitude negates). If you spend 2 additional
      spell points, the target is instead paralyzed for 1 round per caster level
      (Fortitude negates). On a successful save to avoid paralysis, the target
      is instead staggered for 1 round. A target paralyzed by this ghost strike
      is allowed a new Fortitude save each round to end this effect early. This
      is a fullround action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>A creature paralyzed by the Lich Strike talent seems dead, though a
      Perception check (DC 15 + caster level) or Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 caster
      level) reveals that the creature is still alive.</p>
