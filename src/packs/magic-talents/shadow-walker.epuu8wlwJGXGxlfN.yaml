      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Step Through Darkness
      (meld)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>A target must be within an area of dim light or darkness for you to
      apply this meld to them. When this talent is applied, the target
      temporarily steps out of the Material Plane and into the place where it
      borders the Plane of Shadow. While within this region of shadow, the
      target may move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, seeing their relative
      place in the Material Plane, although it appears blurry and lacking in
      details. At any time, the target may step back into the Material Plane, at
      which point the effects of this (meld) talent immediately end.</p>

      <p>Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the
      Material Plane, the target cannot make out details of the terrain or areas
      you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your
      travel will end. It is impossible to judge distances accurately, making
      this ability ill-suited for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when stepping
      back into the Material Plane, the target is shunted 1d10 x 100 feet in a
      random horizontal direction from the desired endpoint. If this would place
      the target within a solid object, they are shunted 1d10 x 1,000 feet in
      the same direction. If this would still place them within a solid object,
      they are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of
      this activity renders the creature fatigued (no save).</p>
