    value: >
      <p>Your companion gains wings and a 30 feet fly speed with a
      maneuverability of average. This increases by 10 feet per 2 Hit Dice.
      Alternatively, your companion may gain flight through magical means: it
      does not gain wings, instead gaining a maneuverability of perfect. This
      then becomes a supernatural ability, and is subject to anti-magic fields
      and other such limitations.</p>
