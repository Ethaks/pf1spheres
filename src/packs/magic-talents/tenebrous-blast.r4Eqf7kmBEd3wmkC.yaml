      <p>Your destructive blast deals negative energy damage. Any creature
      struck by the attack or that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was
      required suffers a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1d4 rounds. Undead
      creatures take no damage, but are instead sickened for 1 round. This
      bypasses the immunities of the undead type.</p>
