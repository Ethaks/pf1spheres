    value: >
      <p>Your destructive blast spews forward a torrent of flesh, organs, blood
      and other bodily fluids. A gore blast deals bludgeoning damage, but
      ignores spell resistance, spell turning, and can penetrate a globe of
      invulnerability, antimagic field, or other forms of antimagic, and is not
      treated as a spell or magical for the purpose of bypassing damage
      reduction, damaging incorporeal creatures or for creatures or classes that
      gain a bonus to saving throws against magic. Creatures struck by your gore
      blast or that fail their Reflex saving throw if one was required suffer a
      -1 penalty to Fortitude saves for 1d4 rounds. This penalty increases to -3
      against saves made against diseases or poisons.</p>
