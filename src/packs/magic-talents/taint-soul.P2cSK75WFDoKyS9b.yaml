    value: >
      <p>Whenever a target fails their saving throw against your ghost strike,
      the creature affected has all healing effects used on it halved for 1
      round per 2 caster levels. If you spend an additional spell point, it
      cannot heal hit point damage by any means for the duration, including fast
      healing and regeneration. In addition, you can touch a willing creature as
      a standard action to cause them to be healed by negative energy and harmed
      by positive energy for 1 minute (Fortitude negates if unwilling); as
      normal, fast healing is unaffected.</p>
