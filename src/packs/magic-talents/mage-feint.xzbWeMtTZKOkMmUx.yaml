      <p>As a trick, you may force a target to succeed at a Will save or lose
      their Dexterity bonus to armor class until their turn. This trick is
      treated as a feint for feats, talents, and effects that trigger off of a
      feint.</p>

      <p>As a trick, you also may use the aid another action on attack or
      defense within range of your illusions. Instead of an attack roll the
      target is allowed a Will save to ignore this effect.</p>
