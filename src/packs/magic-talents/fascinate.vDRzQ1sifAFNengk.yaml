      <p>You distract the target from the world around them.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> The target suffers a -2 penalty to
      Perception checks for 1 round per caster level. This penalty increases by
      1 per 5 caster levels you possess (Will negates).</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> The target is fascinated for 1 round
      per caster level (Will negates). The fascinated creature does not
      immediately break from this condition if they see an obvious threat, but
      instead receives a new saving throw against this effect. If the creature
      is damaged while fascinated, the creature immediately breaks free from
      this effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This is the same as the greater charm,
      except that the target is instead fascinated for 1 minute per caster level
      (Will negates). Additionally, whenever the fascinated creature would
      receive a new saving throw due to hostile actions or threats directed
      towards them, the saving throw is made at a -4 penalty. If the creature
      would be damaged while fascinated, the creature instead receives a new
      saving throw against this effect.</p>
