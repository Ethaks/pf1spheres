      "value": "<p>As a move action, you may summon one masterwork musical instrument, be it percussion, string, or wind, of a size no greater than 1 size smaller than your own size. The instrument is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level.</p>\n<p>If the instrument is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you may summon it into your possession as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You can never have more than one such instrument summoned at one time.</p>\n<p>Starting a song requires a standard action and maintaining one requires a move action. Starting a new song ends any previous songs. A creature can only be under the effects of one song at a time; should a creature affected by one be subjected to another, the caster (not necessarily the performer, if using the Share Link talent) of the second effect must attempt a magic skill check against the MSD of the existing effect&#8217;s caster. All options are sonic mind-affecting effects with medium range unless noted.</p>\n<p>You may perform, singing or playing (either on the summoned instrument or another that you possess) the songs listed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Bewitching Melody:</strong> You may perform a haunting melody that opens the minds of those who hear it to outside influence, inflicting a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter) against charm effects on all hostile creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Dancing Tune:</strong> You play a bouncy jig that compels any creature within close range to dance and caper. A creature can resist by attempting a Will save. Creatures that fail are compelled to dance and shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered as long as you continue to play. Once a creature succeeds at the save against this song, it is immune to further instances originating from you for 24 hours. This is a compulsion effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Distracting Cacophony:</strong> You may fill the air with discordant notes, granting all creatures within medium range a +2 (+1 per 7 caster levels) bonus on saves against sonic effects, but imposing an equal penalty on hearing-based Perception checks and concentration checks. The penalty portion of this ability is not a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Lullaby:</strong> You may play a peaceful lullaby to inflict a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels thereafter) against effects that cause sleep or the staggered condition on all hostile creatures.</p>\n<p>Performing one of these songs will occupy limbs and voice appropriate to the instrument (if any) such that they cannot be used to for other performances (such as bardic music) at the same time.</p>\n",
