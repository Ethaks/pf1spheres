      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Aura of Shattered Loyalties:</strong> Any hostile creature
      within 30 feet of you that is shaken, frightened, panicked or cowering is
      unable to benefit from aid another bonuses, flanking, or teamwork feats
      and does not count as a willing target of its allies&#8217; spells. This
      lasts for as long as the creature remains within this aura. You may
      suppress or resume this effect as a free action. This is a mind-affecting
      fear effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Fear Aura:</strong> Any hostile creature entering within 30
      feet of you must succeed on a Will save or be shaken for as long as they
      remain in the aura and for 1d4 rounds afterwards. Once a creature succeeds
      on the save against this effect, it is immune to any instance of it
      originating from you for 24 hours. You may suppress or resume this effect
      as a free action. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
