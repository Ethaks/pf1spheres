    value: >
      <p>Creatures with this aegis or within this ward appear unremarkable and
      unimportant to those around them. Creatures must succeed at a Will save to
      be able to notice their presence, even if they succeeded on a relevant
      Perception check. A successful save allows them to see the obscured
      creatures normally (assuming they can see the creatures normally), until
      they have left the sight of the creature by either moving out of
      line-of-sight or succeeding at a Stealth check. Creatures who are
      specifically looking for the protected creatures and are aware of their
      identity (like those who have been told you are there by someone else), or
      who are engaged in combat with them automatically pass this saving throw.
      Creatures with this aegis do not leave behind tracks or other signs of
      their passage.</p>
