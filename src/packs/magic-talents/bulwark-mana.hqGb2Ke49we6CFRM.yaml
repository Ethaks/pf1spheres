      <p>You may manipulate your magic around a creature, spending a spell point
      to form a bulwark of magic around the target that absorbs damage. The
      target of this talent gains a temporary spell point, and they gain DR 4/-,
      but this damage reduction only persists for as long as they retain
      temporary spell points from this talent. If the target would suffer damage
      more than twice the amount of damage the bulwark absorbs from a single
      attack, the bulwark is damaged and the target loses a temporary spell
      point granted by this talent. For every 12 points of damage absorbed by
      the bulwark in one round, the target loses a temporary spell point granted
      by this talent. If the creature has no more spell points granted by this
      talent, the shell shatters at the end of the creature&#8217;s next turn,
      ending the effect. You may spend an additional spell point as part of
      casting this ability for every 4 caster levels you possess, granting the
      target an additional temporary spell point for every extra spell point
      spent and allowing the shell to suffer more damage before shattering.</p>

      <p>At 5th caster level, this damage reduction increases to 8/-, and the
      amount of damage a bulwark can reduce each round before losing a spell
      point increases by 12. These bonuses increase by 4 and 12 respectively
      every 5 caster levels thereafter.</p>
