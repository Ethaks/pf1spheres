    value: >
      <p>When you cause a creature to glow, you may spend a spell point to
      overwhelm the target of the glow with visual stimulation. The target must
      succeed at a Will save each round the glow is in effect on them or be
      staggered for one round. When causing a glow to shed bright light the
      target must succeed at a Will save every round the bright light persists
      or become dazed for one round instead of staggered.</p>

      <p>Two consecutive successful Will saves against the glow ends the
      effect.</p>
