      <p>As a trait, you may change a creature&#8217;s size. You may enlarge or
      reduce a creature&#8217;s size by one category, +1 additional size
      category per 5 caster levels, enlarging or reducing the size of their
      equipment as well. You cannot enlarge beyond Large size nor reduce beyond
      Tiny size until caster level 10, and can never enlarge beyond Huge nor
      reduce beyond Diminutive.</p>

      <p>Creatures gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and to AC, as well as a +2
      bonus to Fly checks and a +4 bonus to Stealth checks for every size
      category they are reduced, and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls and AC,
      as well as a -2 penalty to Fly checks and a -4 to Stealth checks for every
      size category they are enlarged. (These numbers are doubled when moving to
      or from Diminutive size.) Ability scores are also adjusted according to
      the target&#8217;s new size; the target gains a +2 bonus to Strength and
      suffers a -2 penalty to Dexterity for every size increase, and a -2
      penalty to Strength and a +2 bonus to Dexterity for every size category
      decrease. This cannot decrease an ability score beneath 1.</p>
