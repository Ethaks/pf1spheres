      "value": "<p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>\n<p><strong>Shadow Reaver:</strong> You do not cast a shadow. When you kill a living creature with CR of at least half your Hit Dice that has a shadow, you gain 1 temporary spell point that expires after 1 minute and cast the shadow of that creature until the spell point is lost.</p>\n<p><strong>Steal Shadow:</strong> You may spend a spell point when attempting a Steal attempt against a creature that has a shadow, stealing its shadow instead of any item if successful. Creatures who have their shadows stolen gain 1 temporary negative level and lose 1 spell point. This loss increases by one die size (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.) for every five caster levels. Creatures who would be reduced below 1st level instead suffer a -2 penalty to Constitution per negative level. Creatures that possess spell slots instead lose spell slots, based on the level of the slot, as detailed in the Introduction chapter.</p>\n<p>You gain an equal number of temporary spell points that expire after 1 minute, though cannot gain more spell points than the target loses. These temporary spell points do not stack with spell points from other targets, other instances of this ability, or any other source and expire after one round per caster level. This ability does not grant a way to use spell points to those that lack one.</p>\n<p>You may restore shadows as a standard action, removing the negative level(s). Shadows are restored automatically at the end of your fey-link, or may be reclaimed by a Steal maneuver at any time or as a standard action with a touch if you are helpless or unconscious.</p>\n",
