      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere (Eject (time)), caster
      level 17th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 5 spell points to touch a target and attempt to
      permanently eject a creature from the space-time continuum unless they
      succeed on a Will saving throw. The subject remains there in a state of
      suspended animation unless a freedom spell or Reclamation is cast at the
      locale where the ejection took place. Magical search by a crystal ball, a
      locate object spell, or other similar divinations (including most effects
      from the Divination sphere) does not reveal the fact that a creature is
      ejected, but the discern location spell or advanced talent does.</p>

      <p>A miracle or wish spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal
      where it has been ejected.</p>

      <p><strong>Reclamation:</strong> In addition to ejecting someone from the
      space-time continuum, you may also spend 5 spell points to return a
      creature ejected from the space-time continuum. This ability must be used
      at the location where the target was first ejected. This talent may also
      be used to free a creature from the effects of an imprisonment or maze
      spell, and can be used to instantly dispel any ongoing effect created by
      the Time sphere, such as a Slow effect, Time Bubble, or Time Clone.</p>
