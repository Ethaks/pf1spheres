      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to have your destructive blast deal untyped
      damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points is entirely
      disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated
      creature&#8217;s equipment is unaffected. This blast type does full damage
      to objects and ignores all hardness, energy resistance, and energy
      immunity.</p>

      <p>When targeting a single object, the destructive blast simply
      disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, it
      disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted.
      Attended objects may attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect, but
      still take destructive blast damage.</p>

      <p>The destructive blast effects even objects constructed entirely of
      force, but not magical effects such as a globe of invulnerability, an
      antimagic field, or a barrier from the Protection sphere.</p>
