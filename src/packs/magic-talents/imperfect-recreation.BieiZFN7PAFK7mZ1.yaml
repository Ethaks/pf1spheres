      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Duplicate (advanced),
      Exquisite Detail, Fleshcraft (advanced, material)), Enhancement sphere
      (Animate Object (enhance), Bestow Intelligence (enhance), Bestow Life
      (advanced)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may use the Duplicate talent to create a living duplicate of a
      creature whose body you have access to (you do not need the full body,
      just a portion such as a hair or bone).</p>

      <p>When you use the Duplicate talent to create a duplicate of a creature,
      you may create it such that the duplicate possesses all of the real
      creature&#8217;s Hit Dice rather than half. However, duplicates created
      with full Hit Dice are not faithful companions in the same manner as
      creatures awakened with Bestow Life. Rather, such creatures are initially
      indifferent to their creators and are created with a random alignment
      (roll on the following table to determine alignment). This roll should be
      done secretly, without the caster immediately knowing the alignment of
      their creation.</p>
