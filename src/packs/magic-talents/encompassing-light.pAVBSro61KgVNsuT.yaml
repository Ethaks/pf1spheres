      <p>You may spend a spell point to create bright light that encompasses the
      glowing creature, allowing it to function as if it were larger than it is.
      The glowing creature deals damage and gains reach as if it were 1 size
      category larger than it is. This improves by one size category for every
      10 caster levels possessed.</p>
