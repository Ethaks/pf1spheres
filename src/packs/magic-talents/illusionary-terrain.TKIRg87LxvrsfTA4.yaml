      <p>As a trick, you may designate a single cube (no larger than your
      maximum illusion size) as difficult terrain for one round per caster
      level. A Will save to disbelieve is allowed by all who enter the cube. On
      a successful save they treat the area as normal. This difficult terrain
      applies to all travel through the area regardless of type of movement.</p>

      <p>You may treat the area of your figments as difficult terrain regardless
      of the type of movement for those who fail to disbelieve.</p>
