      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Light sphere (Lingering Glow), caster
      level 1st.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point you can make a glow permanent, so long as it
      is not placed on an unwilling target. This also transfers control over the
      glow effect to anyone who holds the object, or the creature affected,
      allowing them to choose when to shed light or to simply glow. They may
      also turn the glow off completely as a move action, or turn it on again as
      a standard action.</p>

      <p>These permanent glows cannot be caused to shed bright light, and cannot
      have (light) talents applied to them. Any alterations of the glow&#8217;s
      area or other qualities must be applied and determined when it is made
      permanent and cannot be changed; a permanent glow may only possess one
      unchangeable Style that cannot stain its surroundings, and may only have
      one (nimbus) talent applied, which cannot be changed after the glow is
      created, though the direction of talents such as Beam can be altered as a
      free action normally.</p>
