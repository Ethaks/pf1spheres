      <p>As a standard action, you may create a sphere of darkness with a radius
      of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels, centered anywhere within
      medium range. This darkness radiates from a central point, and cannot
      extend through walls. You must concentrate to maintain this sphere, but
      you may always spend 1 spell point as a free action to make the darkness
      last for 1 minute per level without concentration. You must remain within
      medium range of the darkness to sustain it through concentration.</p>

      <p>In this darkness, bright light (including daylight) becomes dim light,
      imposing a 20% miss chance to attacks. Normal light and dim light become
      absolute darkness. Sources of normal light only produce dim light in a
      5-foot radius, and sources of dim light disappear. This is not subject to
      spell resistance, but creatures with darkvision may see in this darkness
      as normal. You may always dismiss one of your darkness effects as a free
      action.</p>

      <p>Talents designated as (darkness) add additional effects to a sphere of
      darkness. Only one such talent may be applied to an individual sphere of
      darkness, but areas of darkness with different effects may overlap.
      Individual darkness effects do not stack with themselves.</p>

      <p>If an effect that creates light is created inside a darkness effect,
      the creator of the light effect must attempt a magic skill check against
      the creator of the darkness effect. If the check succeeds, the light
      effect functions normally. Otherwise, it functions as any other light
      source, as described above.</p>
