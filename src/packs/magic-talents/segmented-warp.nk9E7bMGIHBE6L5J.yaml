    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to split a teleport in two. You cast a
      single teleport on yourself and pay any spell point costs once, but may
      teleport yourself twice in quick succession.</p>

      <p>Between these two teleports you may only take one action of any kind
      you have remaining. Casting the second teleport does not require a second
      action, but provokes an attack of opportunity regardless (though you may
      cast defensively or use other methods to protect yourself from such
      attacks). The total distance covered by both teleports cannot be longer
      than the maximum range of the initial teleport. If your second teleport is
      disrupted by an attack of opportunity or other means, it is lost.</p>

      <p>If used in conjunction with Pouncing Teleport you do not get extra
      attacks, but may make your attack after either half of the split teleport.
      Attacking this way counts as your single action for the purposes of
      Segmented Warp. If you choose to full attack, you may instead use any
      number of your attacks as a single action, and use any remaining attacks
      after your second teleport. Other abilities that would create additional
      effects with your teleport (such as dual sphere feats) only apply to one
      of the split teleports.</p>
