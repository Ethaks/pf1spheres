      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Light sphere (Intensity Control),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When you use the Intensity Control talent you may spend a spell point
      to increase the radius of your normal and bright light (as well as the
      distance at which light is increased by one step) by 25 feet + 5 feet per
      2 levels instead of just by 10 feet. If you exercise this option, you may
      also spend an additional spell point when creating bright light to cause
      the central 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster level radius to be equivalent to
      daylight for all purposes, including for creatures that are damaged or
      destroyed by such light.</p>
