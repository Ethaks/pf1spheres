      <p>You may use your destructive blast to shield a target within range from
      ranged weapons, area effects, or even other destructive blasts for 1
      round, giving them the benefits of evasion, a +2 cover bonus to AC vs.
      ranged attacks, and a +1 cover bonus to their Reflex saves. These bonuses
      increase by +2/+1 respectively for every 5 caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point, you may perform a rebuff as an immediate
      action, or provide the benefits to all targets within 10-foot of you + 5
      feet per 5 caster levels. You may spend 2 spell points to gain both of
      these benefits with the same rebuff.</p>
