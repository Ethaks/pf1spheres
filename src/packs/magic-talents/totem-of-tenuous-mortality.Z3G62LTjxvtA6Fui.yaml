      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> War sphere, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a totem of tenuous mortality.
      Whenever an enemy within this totem&#8217;s area would be reduced to 0 hit
      points or fewer, they must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or
      instantly die. This is a death effect. Additionally, allies within this
      totem&#8217;s area gain regeneration (acid or fire) equal to 1/2 your
      caster level (minimum 1), but only when they are at a negative hit point
      total. Creatures that possess abilities that allow them to stay conscious
      at 0 or fewer hit points still fall unconscious if they would normally die
      from the amount of damage they have received.</p>
