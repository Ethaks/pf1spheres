      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a consecration that dictates the
      actions of all creatures within its area of effect. When you create this
      consecration, you must declare a course of action that is at most one
      sentence long and whether this action is to be avoided or emulated.
      Example strictures include &#8220;No one can attack&#8221;,
      &#8220;everyone must trade fairly&#8221;, etc. If your stricture would
      cause a creature to attack itself or perform another obviously suicidal
      action, they are immune to that stricture. For as long as you maintain
      this consecration, all creatures within this area must obey this
      stricture. Each individual creature is allowed a Will save to negate this
      requirement and allow itself to act normally. If a creature succeeds at
      their saving throw, they become immune to that stricture for the rest of
      its duration.</p>

      <p>You must always follow your own stricture. You must concentrate to
      maintain this consecration, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. You
      may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow this consecration
      to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.</p>
