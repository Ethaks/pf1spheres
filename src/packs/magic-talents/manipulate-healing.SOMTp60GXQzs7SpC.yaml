      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere (Vitality), caster
      level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point to add the following trait
      options to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Block Healing:</strong> You may remove any fast healing or
      regeneration the target possesses. Additionally, any attempt to magically
      heal the target requires a magical skill check against your MSD.</p>

      <p><strong>Regenerate Flesh:</strong> In addition to the normal healing
      from the Fast Healing option of the Vitality talent, the target&#8217;s
      severed body members (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or
      even heads of multi-headed creatures), broken bones, and ruined organs
      grow back. The physical regeneration is complete in 1 round if the severed
      members are present and touching the creature. It takes 2d10 rounds
      otherwise. This is an upgrade to, and does not stack with, the Fast
      Healing trait.</p>
