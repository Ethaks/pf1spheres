      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere.</p>

      <p>You may grant your companion the troop subtype, with constituent
      members of a Small or Medium size. Your companion&#8217;s troop damage is
      1d6 + 1d6 per 3 Hit Dice with an enhancement bonus, reach, and threatened
      area per the companion&#8217;s attacks (thus a companion with the Battle
      Companion (form) talent summoned with a reach weapon threatens as a
      creature of the individual&#8217;s size with a reach weapon). The troop
      gains no benefit from additional natural attacks, but if it possesses at
      least one natural attack may count its troop damage as a natural attack
      for abilities that modify a natural attack, such as the poison option of
      the Monstrous Attacks (form) talent. The companion still counts as a
      single creature for the purpose of being targeted by mind affecting
      effects.</p>

      <p>This talent cannot be applied to a companion with the Swarm Companion
      (form) talent or with a size other than Medium or Small.</p>
