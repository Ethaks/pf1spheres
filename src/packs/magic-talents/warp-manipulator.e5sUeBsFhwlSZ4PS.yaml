      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Plane Manipulator (space),
      Unwilling Teleport), caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a dimensional anchor as an
      immediate action, allowing you to use it in response to a teleportation
      effect.</p>

      <p>In addition, when a teleport fails due to your dimensional anchor you
      may pay a spell point to redirect it, choosing its destination as if you
      had cast the effect instead of the caster. The caster must succeed on a
      Will save to avoid the effect being redirected.</p>

      <p>If you possess Dimensional Lock, you may spend an additional spell
      point to use it as an immediate action.</p>
