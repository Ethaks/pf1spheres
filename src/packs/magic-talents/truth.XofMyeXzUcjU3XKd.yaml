    value: >
      <p>The target cannot speak deliberate or intentional lies (Will negates).
      They are always aware of this word being placed on them and the caster
      always knows if the target made its saving throw. An affected target may
      still be evasive, refuse to answer, or word their responses carefully.
      This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend a
      spell point to allow the effect to endure for 1 minute per caster level
      without concentration.</p>
