      <p>As a standard action, you may make a single ranged or melee attack
      coupled with a Life sphere ability. This casting cannot be reduced below a
      standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as
      usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it
      is also struck by the Life sphere effect. If using a scatter weapon, the
      effect only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack.</p>
