    value: >
      <p>You may establish a ward on the mind of another, one capable of
      providing protection from mental assault.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You create a metaphysical bubble of
      protective insight over the mind of a willing creature. This bestows a
      morale bonus equal to 1 + 1/2 your caster level to mind-altering effects
      for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This mind shield is
      nullified as soon as the target attempts a single Will save vs. such an
      effect, whether or not the save was successful. This does not suppress or
      remove existing magical effects on creatures, it merely protects them from
      further mental attacks. This charm may be used multiple times per day on
      targets.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> You establish a notional cloud of
      ablative thought over the mind of a willing creature. This blur of
      ideological presence bestows a morale bonus to Will saves vs.
      mind-affecting effects equal to your caster level for a number of rounds
      equal to your caster level. This mind shield is halved in effectiveness
      with each Will save made vs. such an effect, whether or not the save was
      successful. This does not suppress or remove existing magical effects on
      creatures, it merely protects them from further mental attacks.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> You impart an adamant shield of
      conceptual certainty upon the mind of a willing creature. This creature
      gains immunity to any mind-altering spell or effect that would require a
      Will save for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. This immunity
      can be overcome with a magic skill check against your MSD. Even if this
      immunity is bypassed, the target receives a bonus to saves against such
      effects equal to your caster level.</p>
