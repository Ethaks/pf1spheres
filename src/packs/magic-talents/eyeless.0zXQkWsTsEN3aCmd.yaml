      <p>You may create an aegis that protects against effects dependent on
      light, dark, or that attack the senses. This grants a +4 morale bonus to
      AC and saving throws against effects from the Light and Dark spheres,
      attacks based on light or from illusionary sources (although this does not
      grant a bonus to saving throws made to disbelieve illusions), as well as
      gaze attacks and attacks and effects with the shadow descriptor.</p>
