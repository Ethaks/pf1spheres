    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point and target a creature within close range,
      allowing you to borrow the target&#8217;s vision as though it were your
      own. An unwilling creature may attempt a Will saving throw to negate this
      effect. At any time during this effect, as long as the target is within
      long range, you may concentrate on this effect as a move action and
      perceive that creature&#8217;s surroundings as if you were standing where
      that creature was, granting you the ability to see, smell, hear and
      otherwise perceive things as though you were the target. A target is not
      made aware when you perceive the target&#8217;s surroundings using their
      senses.</p>
