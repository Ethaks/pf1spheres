      <p>By spending an additional spell point when you create an object, you
      may work with material with basic acidic properties. You may create acidic
      liquids (3 cubic feet equals a Small creature, and is enough to cover a
      5-foot square).</p>

      <p>If used to coat an object, this deals 1d6 acid damage per round to any
      target that is touching the object. If used to coat the ground, this
      counts as a form of hazardous terrain, and deals 1d6 acid damage per 5
      feet of movement a creature makes across the affected ground. If applied
      to an object that is dropped on a target or used to make attacks, this
      deals +1d6 acid damage. You may coat an object in acid with the same
      action used to create that object.</p>

      <p>When creating acid, you may attempt to spray or drop the acid in a way
      that covers a target. Attempting to cover a target in acid requires acid
      equal to the target&#8217;s size, or double if you wish to spray both the
      target and cover the ground underneath it. Targets may attempt a Reflex
      save to avoid being covered in acid, and if they fail, suffer 1d6 acid
      damage +1d6 per 2 caster levels, per round. Targets may attempt one new
      Reflex save every round as a move action to clean away the acid and end
      the effect. They may also clear away the acid as a full-round action that
      provokes an attack of opportunity without requiring a saving throw.</p>

      <p>Acid loses its potency and deals only minimum damage after 1 round per
      caster level. If you possess Lengthened Creation, this improves to 10
      minutes per caster level.</p>

      <p>If you possess Gaseous Generation you may create acidic gases. These
      follow the rules of Gaseous Generation for determining volume, but at half
      the normal size. This acidic gas deals 1d6 acid damage per round, and an
      additional 1d6 damage for every four caster levels beyond 1st. When an
      acidic gas loses its potency it is dispersed entirely.</p>
