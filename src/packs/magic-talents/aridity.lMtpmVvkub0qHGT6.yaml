      <p>As Heat is the opposite of Cold, Aridity is the opposite of
      Precipitation. If the Precipitation is lowered below step 1 of
      Precipitation, it becomes step 2 of Aridity. If the Aridity is lowered
      below step 1 of Aridity, it becomes step 2 of Precipitation. Water left in
      open air loses about an inch of height per day for every level of combined
      severity between Heat and Aridity</p>

      <p>This becomes 2 inches per combined level at Aridity severity level 6,
      and 4 inches per combined level for Aridity severity level 7.</p>

      <p>In normal conditions, a character can go without water for 1 day plus a
      number of hours equal to his Constitution score. After this time, the
      character must succeed at a Constitution check each hour (DC 10, +1 for
      each previous check) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Characters
      that take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to their total hit points
      begin to take lethal damage instead.</p>

      <p>Beginning at severity level 2, all creatures suffer a penalty equal to
      the Aridity severity level to all saving throws against effects that would
      cause fatigue or exhaustion, as well as to saving throws made against
      thirst. At Aridity severity level 3 creatures must drink twice as much
      water per day to stay healthy.</p>

      <p>At severity level 4, the amount of time a character can go without
      water before they must begin attempting checks, as well as the time
      between checks, is cut in half (12 + 1/2 Constitution modifier hours,
      checks every 30 minutes). This time is cut in half again for each severity
      level above 4.</p>

      <p>Even if they are drinking enough water, targets in areas of extreme
      magically-enhanced aridity still suffer terrible effects as the water in
      their bodies is constantly sucked up by the environment around them.
      Targets in areas of high aridity suffer the same chance of suffering
      nonlethal damage (from desiccation) and suffering fatigue (but not fire
      damage) as if they were in Heat of the same severity level. This does not
      stack with the penalties provided by Heat or Cold. However, if combined
      with Wind or Heat of severity level 4 or higher, the combined effects
      drain the energy from all living creatures, rendering them sickened for as
      long as they are within this environment.</p>

      <p>Characters who have taken nonlethal damage due to desiccation or from a
      lack of food or water are fatigued. Nonlethal damage from thirst or
      starvation cannot be recovered until the character gets food or water, as
      needed, or until they receive magical healing.</p>
