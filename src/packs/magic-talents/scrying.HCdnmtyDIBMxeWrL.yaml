      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Greater Divine
      [range], Viewing (divine)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points and 1 hour to observe a creature or object
      as if using the Viewing talent, but over any distance. If targeting a
      creature, the target is allowed a Will save to resist being viewed, which
      is subject to the following modifiers depending on your knowledge and
      connection to the desired creature. Creatures or objects on a different
      plane receive an extra +5 bonus to their Will save. If viewing an object,
      the object may attempt a save (if intelligent), or any creature holding
      the object, or that could be considered to &#8216;possess&#8217; the
      object is allowed to attempt this save on its behalf. If no such creature
      is available, assume a default Will save of 15.</p>

      <p>If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its
      surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject) as
      if you were present. If the saving throw succeeds, you cannot scry on the
      target again for 24 hours. If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a
      speed of up to 150 feet.</p>
