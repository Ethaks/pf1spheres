      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fallen Fey sphere, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>If you are slain while under the effects of this fey-blessing, you
      immediately reincarnate as the reincarnate spell at the start of your next
      turn (based on when your next turn would be, if you were not dead). You
      return in the same space, or the nearest space that is not intrinsically
      dangerous, though your equipment remains in the place you died. You may
      choose to delay your reincarnation by up to 1 hour. Upon your return, all
      spell slots and spell points you possessed are lost and you gain 1
      negative level until you rest to regain spell points (this negative level
      replaces the negative levels normally incurred by the reincarnate spell).
      If you are slain by an effect that would prevent reincarnation, you may
      attempt a magic skill check against that effect to return regardless. You
      gain a +2 on this check if in a natural setting (not in a settlement or
      artificial structure). Once you have been reincarnated by this ability,
      you cannot benefit from it for 1 week.</p>
