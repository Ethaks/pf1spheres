      <p>This archetype may only be applied to bipedal companions. Your
      companion loses all natural attacks granted by its base form and never
      gains multiattack, but gains the benefits of the Battle Creature (form)
      talent taken twice. A companion with this archetype may never benefit from
      (form) talents that modify or grant natural attacks, though may still make
      unarmed strikes and benefit from feats and abilities that affect unarmed
      strikes as normal.</p>

      <h3 id="toc13"><span>Conjuration Talent Types</span></h3>

      <p>Some talents are marked (form). Whenever you select a (form) talent,
      apply its effects to only a single companion. You may select (form)
      talents multiple times, but no more than once per companion, unless the
      talent says otherwise.</p>

      <h3 id="toc14"><span>Type Talents</span></h3>

      <p>A (type) talent counts as a (form) talent in all ways, except that an
      individual companion may only benefit from a single talent with the (type)
      descriptor (though an individual (type) talent may still be taken multiple
      times if so noted). A (type) talent might change the companion&#8217;s
      creature type to a creature type stated in the talent, although it retains
      the (extraplanar) subtype. This does not change Hit Dice, skills, or grant
      any other benefits associated with the creature type in question, but the
      creature does count as the new type for all interactions such as what
      magic can affect it.</p>
