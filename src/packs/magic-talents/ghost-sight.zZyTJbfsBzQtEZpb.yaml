    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to gain a sense that adds your caster level
      to Perception checks made to notice invisible or ethereal creatures. If
      you succeed at this check, the creature&#8217;s outline becomes visible to
      you. This negates both the usual penalties you would suffer attacking an
      invisible creature, and the bonuses the creature would normally gain
      against you. This continues until you lose line of sight to the creature,
      in which case you must succeed at a new Perception check to see them.</p>
