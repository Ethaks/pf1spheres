      <p>You can spend one spell point to manipulate how rigid an object is. You
      cannot alter an object that is larger than you can create and the normal
      restrictions apply. This talent has no effect on gases or liquids, or
      creatures without hardness as a defensive ability.</p>

      <p>Increasing an object&#8217;s rigidity improves its hardness by up to 1
      per two caster levels (minimum +1), but decreases its hit points by 2 per
      inch per point of hardness increase, as the object&#8217;s structure
      becomes harder, but is in turn more prone to shattering. Objects cannot be
      reduced to less than 1 hit point (walls cannot have less than 1 hit
      point/inch of thickness), and the bonuses to hardness stop when the
      minimum amount of hit points is reached.</p>

      <p>Decreasing an object&#8217;s rigidity lowers its hardness by up to 1
      per 2 caster levels (minimum -1), but increases its hit points by 2 per
      inch per point of hardness lost, as the object&#8217;s structure becomes
      more flexible, but it is no longer as able to resist damage as the
      original. Objects cannot be reduced to a hardness lower than 0, and the
      bonuses to hit points stop when the minimum hardness is reached. This
      effect lasts for one minute per caster level.</p>

      <p>If you possess Lengthened Creation you may use it to extend the
      duration as normal. You may affect a created object with rigidity with the
      same action used to create the object.</p>
