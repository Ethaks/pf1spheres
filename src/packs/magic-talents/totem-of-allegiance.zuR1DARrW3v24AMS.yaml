      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a totem of allegiance. Choose an
      end of the alignment spectrum (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you
      create this totem. Creatures within the area of this totem who possess
      that alignment gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and
      attack rolls. This bonus increases by 1 per 10 caster levels.</p>

      <p>You must select an alignment that you possess. If you are true neutral,
      you may select neutrality with this totem. This only benefits true neutral
      creatures; chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good
      creatures are unaffected.</p>
