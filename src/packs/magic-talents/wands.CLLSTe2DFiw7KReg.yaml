    value: >
      <p>You actualize the target&#8217;s abundant energy and passion. When
      granted as a motif, the target gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. This
      bonus increases by +1 for every 10 caster levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect as an immediate action to cling to
      momentary advantages and make the most of them. For the next minute per
      caster level, whenever a circumstance, competence, insight, or luck bonus
      or bonus due to battlefield positioning, such as flanking, higher ground,
      or cover, would end, the target retains the benefits of that bonus until
      the end of their next turn.</p>
