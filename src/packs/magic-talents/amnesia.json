A reminder of the events, such as witnessing a similar action taken by one of the involved creatures or distinctive items being used in the same fashion or someone spending a free action to inform the person about the event, allows the target to attempt a new Will save to recall the forgotten moment, or the target may have their memory restored through the Life sphere&#8217;s Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, any effect that removes the confused condition, or the use of the Inception talent&#8217;s lesser, greater, or powerful charms being used to specifically make the target remember what was forgotten.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> The target loses all awareness of the immediate past (Will negates). This affects all memories from up to 1 minute per caster level. Alternatively, a target may lose all memory of just a single person, location, item, or event, such as the identity of someone they talked to, or a robbery they participated in. No matter what in their memory is targeted, no more than 1 minute per caster level can be altered or removed from the target&#8217;s memory. A target&#8217;s memory may be restored through the Life sphere&#8217;s Break Enchantment talent, the break enchantment spell, or through the Inception talent&#8217;s greater or powerful charms being used to specifically make the target remember what was forgotten.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> The target loses all memory of events that transpired in the recent past (Will negates). This may erase memories going back 1 day per caster level. The caster may erase all or part of the subject&#8217;s memory of this time. A target&#8217;s memory may only be restored through the Life sphere&#8217;s Break Enchantment effect if the caster also possesses the Restore Senses talent, or through the miracle or wish spells. The target&#8217;s memory may also be replenished through the Inception talent&#8217;s powerful charm being used to specifically make the target remember what was forgotten.</p>\n",
