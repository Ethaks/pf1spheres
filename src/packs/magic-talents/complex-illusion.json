      "value": "<p>When creating a figment, you may spend an additional spell point to divide the figment into multiple, independent components. The combined size and range of these figments must still be within your maximum illusion size, but each component can appear differently and behave differently. While each component can be given its own set of programmed instructions, you can only actively control one component at a time. For example, when creating an illusion of a tavern, a creature with this talent could create a bustling group of people inside the tavern as part of the same illusion.</p>\n<p>The caster could only control one such illusionary person at a time though; and the rest would only perform their last set of instructions. Giving a component a new set of instructions is a move action. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw against a complex illusion, it sees through the entire figment rather than only one component part.</p>\n<p>When creating glamers, you may spend an additional spell point to affect multiple different targets with the same glamer so long as they are all within your illusion range and the combined size of affected targets does not exceed your maximum illusion size. For example, if your maximum illusion size is Large, you could affect with this talent 2 Medium-sized targets or 4 Small-sized targets with your glamer. Once created, each glamer is considered a separate sphere effect.</p>\n",
