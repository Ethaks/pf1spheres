      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>Your destructive blast ignores energy resistance equal to your caster
      level. You may spend a spell point to increase this effect to become twice
      your caster level. If a creature has immunity to your destructive
      blast&#8217;s damage type, treat that immunity as if it were
      &#8216;resistance 40&#8217; instead of &#8216;immunity&#8217; and
      calculate as normal.</p>
