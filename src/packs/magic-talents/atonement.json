      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 10th.</p>\n<p>You may act as an intermediary on behalf of your alignment. If you are connected to a deity or another source of power, you may also intercede on its behalf.</p>\n<p>By spending 2 spell points, you may allow the target to change its alignment or make amends for indiscretions in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost.</li>\n<li>A paladin, cleric, druid, or any other caster whose casting tradition dictates their power comes from an aligned source may lose their powers through indiscretions or alignment changes. You may use this ability to restore that character&#8217;s class levels or magic powers. Sometimes you or the deity you represent may require the target to undertake a quest, make a sacrifice, or perform some other action to prove its desire to atone before it can have its power restored in this fashion.</li>\n<li>You grant the creature the chance to instantly change its own alignment to match yours. The target may freely choose whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to abandon its old alignment. Unless specified by the GM, this cannot work on outsiders or any other creature incapable of changing its alignment naturally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Normally, changing alignment is up to the player. This use of atonement offers a method for a character to change his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.</p>\n",
