      <p>When you create an object, you may create the object anywhere within
      close range, and the object needs to be completely contained within medium
      range. When you alter a target, you may do so with a ranged touch attack
      with a maximum range of close. You may select this talent multiple times.
      Each time it is taken, increase all of these ranges by 1 step (close to
      medium, medium to long).</p>
