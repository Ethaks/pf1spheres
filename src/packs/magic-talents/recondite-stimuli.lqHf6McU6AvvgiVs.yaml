      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere, caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>You can reach the minds of creatures thought, by some, to be
      untouchable by the mental arts. When you gain this talent, you may choose
      plants and oozes, or one creature type from the following list:
      constructs, vermin, or undead.</p>

      <p>Once selected, you may affect creatures of that creature type with your
      charms and other mind-affecting effects, bypassing any type-based immunity
      to mind-affecting effects these creatures may have, and treating mindless
      creatures as having an Intelligence score of 1 for the purposes of Mind
      sphere talents.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This talent may be selected more than once.
      Each time, a different creature type must be selected.</p>
