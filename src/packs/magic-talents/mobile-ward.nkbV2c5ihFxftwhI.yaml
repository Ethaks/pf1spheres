      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>When you move, you may have any ward that you have cast move so that it
      remains centered on you. Forcing a ward against creatures that the ward
      keeps at bay immediately ends the ward.</p>

      <p><strong>Errata:</strong> Mobile wards cannot benefit from the Permanent
      Ward talent.</p>
