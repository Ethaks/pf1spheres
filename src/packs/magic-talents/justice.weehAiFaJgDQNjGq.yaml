    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that enforces balance. Any time a hostile
      creature deals damage to the target, the target gains a +2 insight bonus
      to attack and damage rolls against that enemy for one round. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels. The target may discharge this
      effect when an enemy deals damage to them to shift up to half the damage
      to the enemy who dealt the damage. A successful Fortitude save negates
      this effect and the target still takes the full damage. The target may
      discharge this effect even if the damage they take would normally reduce
      them below 1 hit point, and even if it would kill them outright. Damage is
      transferred after the effects of damage reduction, energy resistance,
      immunity and similar effects.</p>

      <p>The damage transferred is empathic in nature and cannot be further
      reduced, divided, or transferred.</p>
