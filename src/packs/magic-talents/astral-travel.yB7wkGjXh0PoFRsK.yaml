      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Astral Projection
      (advanced), Project Spirit (advanced)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When projecting yourself and/or your allies into the Astral Plane, you
      may spend an additional spell point (bringing the total to 3) to allow you
      and your allies to travel astrally to any of the other planes that border
      the Astral Plane. If you choose to enter one of these planes, you form a
      new physical body (and equipment) on that plane of existence, exactly like
      your true form, although the silver cord remains invisibly attached to
      this new body, and magic items used still count against the item&#8217;s
      total uses. You are still subject to the weaknesses of an astral form (you
      may be dispelled, your cord may be broken, etc.). If your new form is
      killed, you are returned to your original body, gaining 2 permanent
      negative levels as normal.</p>
