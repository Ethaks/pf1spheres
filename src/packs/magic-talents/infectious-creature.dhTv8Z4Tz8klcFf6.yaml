      <p>Choose one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic
      plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or
      slimy doom. When a creature takes damage from a manufactured or natural
      weapon attack made by your companion, it must succeed on a Fortitude save
      with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your companion&#8217;s Hit Dice + Constitution
      modifier or contract the disease immediately (the onset period does not
      apply). Use the disease&#8217;s listed frequency and save DC to determine
      further effects. Regardless of the success or failure of this save, the
      creature is immune to further applications of this ability by your
      companion for 24 hours.</p>
