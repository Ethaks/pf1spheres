    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point and make a melee or ranged touch attack
      against a target within range, causing them to experience a massive amount
      of time in a single instant, rendering them exhausted unless they succeed
      at a Fortitude saving throw. Targets who are already fatigued or exhausted
      fall asleep.</p>

      <p>Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens a
      sleeping creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a
      standard action (an application of the aid another action), and the target
      awaken exhausted if it got less than 1 hour of sleep, or fatigued if it
      got less than roughly 8 hours.</p>
