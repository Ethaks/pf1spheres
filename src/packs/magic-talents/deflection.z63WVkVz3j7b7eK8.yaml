      <p>You grant the target a +1 deflection bonus to AC, +1 per 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <h2 id="toc2"><span>Ward</span></h2>

      <p>As a standard action, you may create a ward centered on yourself with a
      radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per caster level, but can also be made so
      small as to only cover yourself. Wards remain as long as you concentrate,

      caster level without concentration. Wards remain in the location they were
      created, even if you move (however, if the ward is created entirely on top
      of a vehicle, it will move with that vehicle). If a ward affects targets
      inside it, its effects are subject to spell resistance.</p>
