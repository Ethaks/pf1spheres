    value: >
      <p>When a creature with an aegis you created becomes the target of a spell
      or sphere ability that affects only them, you may spend a spell point and
      sacrifice an aegis they are bearing as an immediate action to attempt to
      counterspell the ability and redirect the effect. You attempt a magical
      skill check against the magical skill defense of the caster, and if
      successful, the sphere effect affects the caster as if they had been the
      original target. Any bonuses you or the other sphere caster have to
      counterspelling apply to this roll. The decision to do this must be made
      before any attack roll or saving throw is made.</p>
