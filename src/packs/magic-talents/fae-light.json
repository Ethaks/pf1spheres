If you possess the Light sphere, you may count as being under the effects of your own glow while this fey-blessing is active.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you may create a light that sheds light like a torch within medium range. You may move this light 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels per round as a move action, though it must stay within range of you. This light persists for the duration of the fey-link or until you create another one.</p>\n<p>You may choose to have either your light or the moveable light shed an enchanting glow. Creatures within a 30-foot radius of the light must succeed on a Will save or be fascinated. A creature that successfully saves is immune to your use of this ability for 24 hours. If a creature fails its saving throw, it approaches to stand adjacent to the light and follows it if it moves. As normal, fascinated creatures suffer a -4 penalty to Perception, but cease to be fascinated if attacked or approached with an obviously hostile intent, such as someone drawing a weapon. This is a mind-affecting effect. You may alter the color or dismiss the light as a free action.</p>\n",
