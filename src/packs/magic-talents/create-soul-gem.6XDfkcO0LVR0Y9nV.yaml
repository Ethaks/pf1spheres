      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You draw forth the ebbing life force of a dying creature or one that
      has died in the past round, transforming it into a soul gem. The target
      must be within range of your ghost strike in order for you to use this
      ability on them (or within close range if you do not possess the ability
      to use ghost strike). If the creature is dying but alive and fails its
      saving throw, it dies and you capture its soul in the gem.</p>

      <p>If the creature is dead, it can still resist this effect by attempting
      a Will save as if it were still alive. The value of the soul gem created
      depends on the nature of the creature it is made from (see below). Soul
      gems created by this effect crumble to dust after 1 day per caster level,
      releasing the trapped soul to travel on to the afterlife.</p>

      <p>Only one soul gem can be created from a dying creature. Any attempt to
      resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a magical
      skill check against your MSD. Failure results in the resurrection having
      no effect, while success shatters the target&#8217;s soul gem and returns
      the creature to life as normal. If you possess the Death sphere Soul Trap
      advanced talent, you may transfer a soul contained in a soul gem into an
      appropriate gemstone as a standard action by spending 3 spell points.</p>

      <p>If a creature does not possess a soul, they are unaffected by this
      talent. If a creature&#8217;s soul is already pledged to another entity
      such as a god or outsider, said entity may seek to reclaim the soul
      somehow.</p>
