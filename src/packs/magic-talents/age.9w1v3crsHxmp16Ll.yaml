      <p>You may spend a spell point to increase or decrease a target&#8217;s
      age by 1 category (unwilling creatures attempt a Fortitude save to
      negate). This adds or removes penalties to physical ability scores but
      does not add or remove bonuses to mental ability scores. You may move the
      target 1 age category older or younger, plus an additional category for
      every 5 caster levels possessed.</p>

      <p>This cannot cause the target to die of old age, nor become so young
      they were never born. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but
      you may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect
      to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. The
      effects of different age categories are cumulative (thus, a target moved
      from young adult to venerable would suffer a -6 penalty to all physical
      ability scores).</p>

      <p>You may also target an object instead of a creature.</p>

      <p>Attended objects are permitted a Will save by their holder to negate
      this ability. Unless noted, the chosen effect persists for as long as you
      concentrate, or for 1 minute per caster level if you spend an additional
      spell point. Choose from the following effects:</p>

      <p><strong>Restore:</strong> As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a
      spell point when targeting an object with the broken condition to restored
      it to the form it previously had, removing the broken condition. This does
      not restore any charges to limited use items nor restore expended
      single-use items. This option can also be used to counter or dispel the
      other applications of this talent with requiring a magic skill check.</p>

      <p><strong>Spoilage:</strong> As an instantaneous effect, you may cause an
      amount of food sufficient to feed 1 Medium creature per caster level to
      spoil or cause an equal amount of spoiled food to return to a palatable
      state. This does not remove other changes made to the food, such as adding
      poison or magical effects unless you spend a spell point and succeed on a
      magic skill check against the poison or effect&#8217;s DC. Restoring the
      food does not prevent future spoilage.</p>

      <p><strong>Weather:</strong> The object is shifted to its future state,
      reducing its hardness by your caster level.</p>
