    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to lift an unwilling creature with
      telekinesis. The target is allowed a Will save to negate this effect, plus
      an additional Will save each round the effect is maintained. Telekinesis
      used in this way is subject to spell resistance.</p>

      <p>If a Hostile Lift is sustained with Sustained Force, it only lasts
      until the target succeeds at its save. A creature may suffer falling
      damage if they successfully save while floating high in the air.</p>
