      <p>As a concentration effect, you may use a limited form of Reforge that
      can even affect attended objects. When targeting an attended object, you
      may apply one of the following effects.</p>

      <p><strong>Reforged Edge:</strong> You may target a weapon and affect its
      critical hit threat range, increasing or decreasing it by 1, +1 per 10
      caster levels. This bonus or detriment is applied after abilities and
      feats such as Improved Critical or the keen weapon special ability, and
      cannot be doubled. If this would decrease a weapon&#8217;s critical hit
      threat range below 1, the weapon instead has its critical hit multiplier
      decreased by 1 for every point it is reduced below 1 (minimum x1 crit
      multiplier).</p>

      <p><em>Author's Note:</em> This sphere effect can increase the critical
      threat range of a weapon to be higher than normally possible (such as
      12&#8211;20 with a sufficiently high caster level). By GM discretion, a GM
      can adjust this talent to not increase the critical threat range of an
      altered weapon higher than 15&#8211;20.</p>

      <p><strong>Reforged Reach:</strong> You may target a weapon and increase
      the weapon&#8217;s reach by up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Chill Metal:</strong> If you possess the (water) package, you
      may target a piece of metal or mostly-metal equipment and decrease its
      temperature. Any creature who begins their round touching the chilled
      metal takes 1d6 cold damage per 2 caster levels. If the chilled metal is
      something they are holding such as a sword or coin, they may attempt a
      Reflex save to drop the item to take only minimum damage, otherwise, the
      creature may attempt a Fortitude save for half damage. Worn equipment such
      as armor cannot be dropped in this fashion. If the object is used as a
      weapon, it deals an additional 1d6 cold damage. If this ability is used on
      a metal object with moving parts (such as a door&#8217;s hinges), those
      pieces become non-functional as they freeze together, requiring a Strength
      check to beat your MSD to break loose and restore functionality.</p>

      <p><strong>Heat Metal:</strong> If you possess the (fire) package, you may
      heat metal. This functions the same as chill metal, except dealing fire
      damage instead of cold damage, and moving parts cease functionality due to
      being slightly welded rather than frozen.</p>
