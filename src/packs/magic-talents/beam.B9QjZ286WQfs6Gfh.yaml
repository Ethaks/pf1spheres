      <p>When you cause a glow effect to shed normal or bright light, you can
      focus this light into a cone (doubling the affected distance) or a line
      (quadrupling the affected distance). This also doubles or quadruples the
      distance to which light is increased one step to a maximum of normal
      light. You may change the direction the light projects as well as switch
      whether the light is a cone, line, or an emanation each once per round as
      a free action.</p>
