    value: >
      <p>You may create bright light that partially assimilates a glowing
      creature and its carried equipment, allowing them to momentarily shed
      their physical form. A creature under this effect can choose to move
      through solid objects as long as there are no factors that block normal
      sight (such as concealment from darkness or fog). This allows them to pass
      through transparent barriers like glass or through impossibly small gaps
      (such as a keyhole), but not objects affected by Fenestrate.</p>
