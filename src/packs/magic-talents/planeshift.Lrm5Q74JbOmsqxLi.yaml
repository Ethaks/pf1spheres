      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Distant Teleport, True
      Teleport (advanced), Unseeing Teleport), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 additional spell points to teleport to an alternate
      dimension or plane of existence. You must know the plane you are trying to
      reach, as well as where within that plane you would like to appear (if you
      do not know a specific location to appear on that plane you may still use
      this ability, but you run the risk of appearing anywhere on that plane).
      Even if you do have a specific location in mind, you always appear 5 to
      500 miles (5 x d100) from your intended destination.</p>
