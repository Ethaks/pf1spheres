      "value": "<p>Choose either animals or vermin. You may take this talent twice to gain both options.</p>\n<p>You may spend a spell point as a standard action to cause the chosen creature type to treat you as a friend for 1 minute per caster level. Indifferent creatures (such as domesticated animals or domesticated honeybees) become friendly to you, while unfriendly creatures (such as wild animals) become indifferent to you. This means that wild creatures will not attack unless provoked, and you may make requests of these creatures, provided you may communicate with them (if you cannot communicate with a creature, only basic commands such as &#8216;go&#8217;, &#8216;come&#8217;, &#8216;fight&#8217;, or &#8216;stay&#8217; may be communicated). This has no effect on animals or vermin who are hostile to you (such as those already in combat), and a creature with a master (such as an animal companion) will still attack if commanded to by its master.</p>\n<p>Once during the duration of this ability, you may call the nearest animal or vermin (depending on the type chosen when this talent is taken) of a particular type you designate to seek you out. The creature&#8217;s CR cannot exceed your caster level, though if you choose vermin you may summon a swarm with a CR no more than 1/2 your caster level. The creature moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive depends on how close a creature of the desired type is when you cast the spell. If there is no animal or vermin of that type capable of reaching you within this effect&#8217;s duration, you are aware of this fact.</p>\n",
