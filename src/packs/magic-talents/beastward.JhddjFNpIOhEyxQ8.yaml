      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Animal Affinity:</strong> Wild animals have a default
      disposition toward you of neutral and domestic animals have a default
      disposition of friendly. Creatures of the animal type will not attack you
      unless compelled to do so by a Handle Animal check or a compulsion
      effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Repel Beast:</strong> Creatures of the animal type will not
      approach closer to you than than 30 feet unless compelled to do so by a
      Handle Animal check or a compulsion effect. Creatures of the animal type
      within this range are shaken as long as they remain within it. This does
      not apply to animal allies such as animal companions, summoned creatures
      of the animal type, or creatures that are tame per the <a
      href="/beastmastery">Beastmastery</a> sphere (see Spheres of Might).</p>

      <p><strong>Repel Vermin:</strong> Creatures of the vermin type will not
      approach closer to you than than 30 feet unless compelled to do so by a
      Handle Animal check or a compulsion effect. Creatures of the vermin type
      within this range are shaken as long as they remain within it. This
      ignores the immunity to the shaken condition granted by the vermin type.
      This does not apply to vermin under your control such as vermin
      companions, summoned vermin, or creatures that are tame per the <a
      href="/beastmastery">Beastmastery</a> sphere (see Spheres of Might).</p>

      <p><strong>Vermin Affinity:</strong> Vermin have a default disposition
      toward you of neutral. Creatures of the vermin type will not attack you
      unless compelled to do so by a Handle Animal check or a compulsion
      effect.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point, the chosen effect extends to
      all allied creatures within 30 feet. You may not have the affinity and
      repel options for the same creature type active at the same time;
      attempting to do so ends the previous effect.</p>
