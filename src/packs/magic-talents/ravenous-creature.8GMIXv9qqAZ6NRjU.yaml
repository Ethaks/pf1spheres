    value: >
      <p>You companion gains the swallow whole ability, allowing it to make a
      grapple attempt to swallow a creature that it has grappled at the start of
      its turn as a standard action. If the companion possesses a bite attack, a
      successful grapple check to swallow whole deals bite damage.</p>

      <p>Each round the creature remains swallowed, it is dealt 1d6 bludgeoning
      damage plus an additional 1d6 acid damage per 3 Hit Dice (minimum 0d6).
      Your companion may swallow creatures up to one size smaller than itself.
      This trait may be taken twice; the second time allows your companion to
      swallow creatures up to their own size and grants a bonus to CMB and CMD
      equal to 1 plus 1 per 3 Hit Dice on grapple checks made to swallow
      creatures or to prevent them from escaping once swallowed. More than one
      creature may be swallowed at a time, but you may not exceed the maximum
      total size that can be swallowed, counting two Tiny creatures as one Small
      creature, two Small creatures as one Medium creature, etc.</p>

      <p>A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light
      slashing or piercing weapon, or it can try to escape the grapple. The
      amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 the
      companion&#8217;s total hit points. This damage is inflicted on the
      companion as normal.</p>

      <p>The armor class of the interior of a creature that swallows whole is 10
      + 1/2 its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If
      a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the swallowing creature cannot use
      swallow whole again until the companion receives healing equal to the
      damage dealt. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts
      it back in the attacker&#8217;s mouth, where it may be bitten (if the
      companion possesses a bite attack) or swallowed again.</p>
