      <p>The target suffers debilitating pain. The target suffers 1d4 + 1/2 your
      caster level in nonlethal damage (no save). You may spend a spell point to
      cause this target to suffer this damage each round for a total number of
      rounds equal to your caster level. For 1 round (or as long as this word is
      in effect) the target suffers a -4 penalty to all mental skill checks
      (such as Bluff, Spellcraft, Sense Motive, or Survival), and must succeed
      at a magic skill check (DC 10 + 1/2 the damage dealt + 1/2 the caster
      level) to use a sphere effect or spell.</p>
