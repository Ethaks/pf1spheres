      <p>The companion grows spines, quills, or thorns. These may be treated as
      armor spikes of their size (1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, 20x2, piercing) but may
      be enhanced as natural weapons and may be wielded as a secondary natural
      weapon if beneficial. The companion is automatically proficient with these
      spikes. This talent may be taken a second time, allowing the companion to
      launch spines as a thrown weapon (1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, 20x2, piercing)
      with a range increment of 20 feet. The companion may draw the spines as a
      free action and throw them for any attacks it is entitled to normally.
      Launched spines regenerate at the end of its turn.</p>
