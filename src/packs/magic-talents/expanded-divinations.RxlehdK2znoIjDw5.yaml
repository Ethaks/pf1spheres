      <p>Pick any three alternate divinations which you do not currently
      possess. You gain access to those alternate divinations as if you
      possessed the requisite spheres. If the alternate divination has an
      additional prerequisite such as the Nature sphere&#8217;s Divine Elements,
      you pick which one you gain access to upon acquiring it. This talent may
      be taken multiple times. Each time you may pick three alternate
      divinations which you do not possess.</p>
