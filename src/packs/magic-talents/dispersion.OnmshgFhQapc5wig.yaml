      <p>You imbue a creature or object with a field of refracting cognitive
      energy that makes it difficult to focus on what or where the field
      masks.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Cloud:</strong> The creature or object becomes difficult
      to locate intentionally and almost impossible to stumble across
      accidentally. Perception checks made to recognize a creature or locate
      such an object or person have their DCs increased by 1 + 1 for every 2
      caster levels, and any creature with this ability placed upon them may
      immediately attempt to hide even if observed or without cover or
      concealment. Loud noises, sudden actions, or other typically noticeable
      events allow creatures near such an effect to attempt a Perception check
      (still modified by the lesser cloud&#8217;s boost to DCs) to notice the
      creature. This effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster
      level. If the creature makes an attack against another creature, the
      effect automatically ends.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Cloud:</strong> In addition to the effects of the
      lesser cloud, a magic skill check may be rolled at the time of casting,
      prompting a Will save from anyone in the cloud&#8217;s line of sight. If
      the check result is higher than any given observer&#8217;s Will save, then
      when the target is successfully hidden from direct observation the
      observer will forget about their active presence in the environment. If
      the observer is reminded about the target by being told of its presence or
      directly observing it, the observer gains another Will save to recall the
      target and the target&#8217;s significance to the current situation.
      (Successfully hiding again may, however, cause the observer to forget the
      target again.)</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Cloud:</strong> In addition to the effects of the
      lesser and greater cloud, the warded area, object, or creature becomes
      supernaturally difficult to observe. Even if a creature is aware of the
      target, they must succeed at a Will save every round to actively engage
      with the target, such as through conversation, attacking, searching, or
      medical treatment. Skill checks that are carried out over the course of
      minutes, hours, or days (or similar unit of time) instead of rounds impose
      a Will save for every unit of time involved instead of every round due to
      the increased intentional focus of the people performing such tasks (up to
      the duration of the Dispersion effect).</p>
