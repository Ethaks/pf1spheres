    value: >
      <p>When a creature within range fails a saving throw, skill check, or
      ability check, or misses with an attack, you may spend a spell point as an
      immediate action to allow them to reroll the saving throw, skill check,
      ability check, or attack roll. However, starting after the reroll, they
      take a -4 penalty to that category of roll until they fail another such
      saving throw or check or, if they reroll an attack roll, until they miss
      with another attack.</p>

      <p>Failing the rerolled saving throw or check or missing with the rerolled
      attack does not end this effect, nor does deliberately failing a saving
      throw, failing a saving throw against a harmless effect, or attacking an
      object or ally.</p>
