      <p>You may create a ward that suppresses one energy type of your choice
      (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). Any damage of that energy type
      dealt within this area is reduced by 10 + your caster level. You may also
      create an aegis that grants energy resistance 10 + your caster level to
      either acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. These effects only absorb
      damage and may not protect from other side effects of an attack.</p>
