      "value": "<p>You imbue an area, creature or object with a field of disruptive cognitive energy, making it difficult to communicate or convey expression and meaning. Additionally, whenever a creature benefiting from a sphere effect granting them additional languages or insights into language would enter the cloud, you may attempt a magic skill check against the effect&#8217;s magic skill defense. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled; if you fail, the effect is not affected and cannot be dispelled by the same cloud for 24 hours. If you possess the Mass Charm talent, you may choose to have the cloud ignore any amount of creatures you designate, which can be changed as a free action.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesser Cloud:</strong> Creatures within the cloud suffer a -2 penalty to all Charisma-based skills checks, in addition to a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against language-dependant effects. These bonuses and penalties increase by 1 per 3 caster levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Cloud:</strong> As the lesser cloud, except that they lose all languages that they possess that require verbal speech (this excludes telepathy or non-verbal languages) for as long as they remain within the cloud. These creatures can still shout and act out simple concepts, but the capabilities of speech are lost to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Cloud:</strong> As the greater cloud, except that they lose all ability to communicate in all forms, including non-verbal languages and telepathy, for as long as they remain within the cloud. This also means that these creatures cannot act out simple concepts or emote in any way, except for volume.</p>\n",
