      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Mass Teleport [mass],
      Ranged Warp [range]), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>By spending 2 spell points, you may teleport any number of targets
      within your Ranged Warp range. If you possess Unwilling Teleport, you only
      need to spend one spell point no matter how many unwilling targets are
      affected. If an unwilling target succeeds at their saving throw, other
      targets are still affected as normal. If you possess Teleport Object, you
      may also teleport any number of objects so long as each individual object
      is within your weight limit (or size limit if you possess Teleport
      Structure).</p>
