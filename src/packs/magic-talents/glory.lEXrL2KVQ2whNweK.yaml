    value: >
      <p>As a free action you may cause any glow placed on yourself or an item
      in your possession to shed bright light in a 5-foot radius, activating the
      effects of (light) talents and other abilities that require bright light.
      You do not need to concentrate to maintain this smaller area of bright
      light, nor do you need to spend a spell point. You may still follow the
      normal rules for causing your glow effects to shed bright light in order
      to shed bright light in a larger area. If you have multiple glow effects
      that could benefit from this talent, you may only cause one of them to
      shine bright light this way, but may switch which one Glory affects as a
      free action once per turn. An item that leaves your possession (such as by
      being thrown or disarmed) loses the benefits of this talent until you
      recover it.</p>
