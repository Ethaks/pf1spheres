      <p>By activating this fey-blessing, you gain a pouch of fairy dust. This
      pouch has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. The pouch is
      weightless and may not be used to hold anything other than the fairy dust
      it contains. If the pouch is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends. Destroying
      the pouch fills a 10-foot radius with the chosen fairy dust, affecting all
      creatures in the area, including the caster. A successful saving throw
      against any effect that allows it grants the affected creature immunity to
      that effect from that caster for 24 hours. You gain knowledge of two types
      of fairy dust when you gain this talent; you may activate any one type of
      dust that you know when activating this fey-blessing. Choose from the
      following options:</p>

      <p><strong>Amnesia:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will
      save or forget the past minute. This otherwise functions as the Amnesia
      talent greater charm of the Mind sphere. You must spend an additional
      spell point for this option.</p>

      <p><strong>Bleed:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude
      save or bleed profusely when wounded. The next time the creature takes hit
      point damage, it begins taking bleed damage equal to your caster level.
      These bleed damage may be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or by receiving
      any amount of healing. If this dust is applied to a weapon, the weapon
      attack triggers the bleed damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Blind:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Reflex
      save or treat all other creatures as having concealment for 1 round per
      caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Charm:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save
      or have its disposition toward you increase by 1 step to a maximum of
      friendly for 1 minute.</p>

      <p><strong>Fear:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save
      or be shaken for 1 round per caster level. You may spend an additional
      spell point as part of activating the fey-blessing to instead have
      affected creatures be frightened for 1 round per caster level on a failed
      save and shaken for 1 round on a successful save.</p>

      <p><strong>Glitter:</strong> For 1 round per caster level, affected
      creatures take a penalty to Stealth equal to caster level and do not gain
      concealment from any effect that provides invisibility.</p>

      <p><strong>Poison:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude
      save or suffer from itching poison, being compelled to scratch at the
      wound for 1 round (treat this as being dazed) and taking 1d2 Strength
      damage per round. This effect ends after 1 minute, but targets are allowed
      a new saving throw each round to end the effect early. You must spend an
      additional spell point for this option.</p>

      <p><strong>Sleep:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save
      or fall asleep for 1 round per caster level. Slapping or wounding awakens
      an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a
      standard action (an application of the aid another action). You must spend
      an additional spell point for this option.</p>

      <p>If you possess Fairy Flight, you also gain the following option:</p>

      <p><strong>Flight:</strong> For 1 minute per caster level, affected
      creatures gain the benefits of your Fairy Flight fey-blessing. This flight
      speed requires maintaining the proper frame of mind; if an affected
      creature is under the effects of an emotion or fear effect while flying,
      its fly speed from this ability is suppressed and it falls at a rate of 50
      feet per round until it lands (taking falling damage as normal) or the
      emotion or fear effect ends.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may fill a 5-foot cube within close range
      with the dust, affecting any creature in that space. As a move action, you
      may apply fairy dust to a weapon, natural weapon, or piece of ammunition
      you possess, or as a standard action you may apply it to a number of
      weapons or pieces of ammunition equal to your casting ability modifier
      (minimum 2) within close range. A creature that is struck by the weapon
      within 1 round per caster level of it being so treated suffers from the
      effects of the dust, ending the effect on the weapon. You may choose to
      end this fey-blessing early, drawing and throwing the pouch to create a
      20-foot radius spread of fairy dust within close range, affecting all
      creatures within the area.</p>

      <p>The duration of multiple applications of dust stack. The pouch
      replenishes itself as a free action for the duration of the fey-blessing,
      then disappears when it ends. You may have multiple instances of this
      fey-blessing active at once; select a different option you know for each.
      Each instance creates a separate pouch. If the pouch is not in your
      possession at the start of your turn, you can summon it to yourself as a
      move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You may select this
      talent multiple times; each time you gain two more types of fairy
      dust.</p>
