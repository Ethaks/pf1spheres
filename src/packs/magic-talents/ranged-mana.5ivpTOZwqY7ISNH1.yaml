      <p>Your manabond, expunge, and (manipulation) abilities have a range of
      medium instead of close.</p>

      <p>If a creature is beyond close range for your manabond, but still within
      their maximum range, the creature may attempt a concentration check
      against your Mana sphere DC at the end of each of their turns in order to
      end the manabond.</p>

      <p>You can take this talent a second time, increasing the range from
      medium to long.</p>
