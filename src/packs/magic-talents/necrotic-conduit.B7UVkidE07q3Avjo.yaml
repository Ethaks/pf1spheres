      <p>You gain the following abilities which allow you to direct, manipulate,
      and command undead creatures you control within your dominion range:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Command Attack:</strong> As a standard action, one undead
      within your dominion range makes an attack against a creature within its
      threatened reach (or range, if the undead can use a ranged weapon). If you
      possess the Mass Death Magic talent, you may spend an additional spell
      point to grant an attack to 1 additional undead per 2 caster levels
      (minimum 1). If a creature would be attacked by more than one undead with
      this effect, choose one undead to be the primary attacker. Each additional
      undead attacking that same target instead uses the aid another action to
      assist the primary attacking undead&#8217;s attack roll, even if those
      undead could not normally use the aid another action to assist against
      that target. If you possess the Reanimated Warriors talent, you may use
      this ability to allow your undead to assist your own efforts. As an
      immediate action after you make a weapon attack roll, you may choose one
      undead within your dominion range. That undead either uses the aid another
      action to assist your attack roll or is granted an attack of opportunity
      against the target of your attack, provided that your attack hits the
      target. An undead granted the ability to use the aid another action or
      granted an attack of opportunity this way must be able to take the action
      normally, such as being in a position to aid another you normally or by
      having the target of your attack within their threatened area.</li>

      <li><strong>Siphon Life:</strong> Whenever you or an undead within your
      dominion range reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, you may use
      this talent as an immediate action to grant yourself or an undead within
      range a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your caster level
      which last for 1 minute. You may use this effect as a free action that can
      be taken even when it is not your turn by spending an additional spell
      point.</li>

      <li>Creatures within your dominion range of you or an undead with
      temporary hit points from this effect take a -2 penalty on their saving
      throw against the Necrotic Feeding (ghost strike) talent.</li>

      <li><strong>Unnerving Pulse:</strong> As a standard action, one undead
      within range releases an unnerving wave of energy. Creatures within 5 feet
      + 5 feet per 5 caster levels are shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will negates).
      This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Mindless undead under your control are always considered willing
      targets of these abilities. An unwilling undead may attempt a Will save to
      negate this talent&#8217;s effects and not be manipulated.</p>
