      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, causing it to be veiled in
      plasma that leaps to strike its allies. Each round at the beginning of its
      turn, one of the target&#8217;s allies, chosen at random, within close
      range takes electricity damage equal to 1d6 + your caster level. The ally
      can attempt a Reflex save to halve this damage.</p>
