      <p>When you teleport, you may choose to delay the effect for up to a
      number of rounds equal to your caster level. The teleport does not come
      into effect immediately and instead takes place at the start of your turn
      after the chosen number of rounds occur. You must decide on any variables
      and pay any additional spell points for this teleport effect (e.g.
      distance, direction, etc.) when you delay the effect. When the delayed
      teleport occurs, if the target location is not valid, the effect fails and
      does not occur. For example, a teleport can fail if you do not pay an
      additional spell point for Unseeing Teleport and, when the delayed
      teleport occurs, the teleport would move you to a space you do not have
      line of sight for.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point when delaying a teleport with
      this talent, you may cast and delay a second teleport effect which must be
      delayed at least one additional round longer than the first teleport you
      delayed.</p>
