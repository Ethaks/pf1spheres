      <p>You may enhance creatures or objects, protecting any other magic they
      might be subject to. Whenever a creature attempts to Counterspell or
      otherwise dispel a magical effect on the target, they must first roll
      their check against your magic sink, only rolling against the intended
      magical effect if this first check was a success. While Magic Sink can be
      countered when first cast, it is not considered its own magical effect
      once applied to a target and cannot be dispelled; instead, it is
      considered an augment to the other magical effects the target is affected
      by.</p>
