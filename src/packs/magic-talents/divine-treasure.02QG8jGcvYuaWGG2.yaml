      <p>You may divine the presence of valuable items within range. Items exude
      an aura depending on their gold piece value and collections of material
      (such as piles of gold coins, a bushel of exotic fruit, or chests full of
      gemstones) radiate their auras as a single aura. You gain an insight bonus
      on Appraise checks equal to half your caster level to discern the value of
      objects you divine with this sphere effect. Utilize the following chart
      when determining value:</p>
