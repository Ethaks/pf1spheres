      <p>When creating a figment, you may spend an additional spell point to
      divide the figment into multiple, independent components. The combined
      size and range of these figments must still be within your maximum
      illusion size, but each component can appear differently and behave
      differently. While each component can be given its own set of programmed
      instructions, you can only actively control one component at a time. For
      example, when creating an illusion of a tavern, a creature with this
      talent could create a bustling group of people inside the tavern as part
      of the same illusion.</p>

      <p>The caster could only control one such illusionary person at a time
      though; and the rest would only perform their last set of instructions.
      Giving a component a new set of instructions is a move action. If a
      creature succeeds at its saving throw against a complex illusion, it sees
      through the entire figment rather than only one component part.</p>

      <p>When creating glamers, you may spend an additional spell point to
      affect multiple different targets with the same glamer so long as they are
      all within your illusion range and the combined size of affected targets
      does not exceed your maximum illusion size. For example, if your maximum
      illusion size is Large, you could affect with this talent 2 Medium-sized
      targets or 4 Small-sized targets with your glamer. Once created, each
      glamer is considered a separate sphere effect.</p>
