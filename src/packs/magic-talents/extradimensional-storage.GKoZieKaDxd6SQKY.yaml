      <p>You gain a permanent extradimensional space that may hold up to 10
      pounds per caster level of non-living material. You can create a portal to
      this extradimensional space within arm&#8217;s reach at will. Placing an
      object in this space or calling an object from this space requires a
      full-round action, but may be done as a swift action by spending a spell
      point. Living things and attended objects cannot be placed in your
      extradimensional storage. If you die (or are destroyed, if you lack a
      Constitution score), all contents of your extradimensional space appear in
      your square or the nearest unoccupied space.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent two times; when taken a second time your
      extradimensional space may hold an additional 15 pounds per caster level,
      for a total of 25 pounds per caster level. In addition, you may place or
      withdraw an object from your extradimensional space as a move action
      instead of a full-round action, which counts as drawing the equipment
      normally. If the object would normally be worn or have to be donned in
      some way (such as armor or a magic ring), you may remove or don it as part
      of the same action as placing or withdrawing it from storage.</p>
