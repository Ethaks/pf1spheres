    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you bind the target with their own blood,
      constricting the target with chains, vines, or tattoo-like stains. On a
      failed Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss and is bound. A
      creature bound by this effect is entangled. You may concentrate to
      maintain this effect each round, or may spend a spell point as a free
      action to allow this effect to persist for 1 round per caster level
      without concentration. A creature is allowed a new saving throw each round
      as a move action to end this effect.</p>

      <p>When you cast this blood art, you may spend an additional spell point
      to entwine your health to the target&#8217;s blood for the duration of
      this effect. If you do, whenever you take damage, you may choose one
      creature bound by this blood art who you have entwined your health to.
      That creature takes damage equal to the amount of damage you suffered (to
      a maximum of your caster level).</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> You may only deal damage to another
      creature by suffering damage with this effect once per round.</p>
