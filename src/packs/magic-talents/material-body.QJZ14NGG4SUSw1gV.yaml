      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (any (material) talent,
      Change Material (alter)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to change a willing, touched
      creature&#8217;s skin into another solid material you can create as long
      as you maintain concentration to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level.
      You may spend an additional spell point to maintain this effect without
      concentration. If you possess Lengthened Creation, the duration of this
      ability is increased to 1 hour per caster level.</p>

      <p>The creature gains damage reduction equal to the material&#8217;s
      hardness. This damage reduction is bypassed by adamantine as long as the
      material&#8217;s hardness is less than 20. Once this damage reduction has
      prevented a number of points of damage equal to the material&#8217;s hit
      points per inch per 3 caster levels the effect ends.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Fleshcrafting advanced talent, the effect increases,
      granting the target a +4 bonus to saving throws against diseases and
      poisons, and a 50% chance that any critical hit or sneak attack against
      the target is treated as a normal hit, as if the target were wearing
      medium fortification armor.</p>
