      <p>Your companion mimics the properties of oozes. The companion gains the
      ooze creature type. Your companion can move through an area as small as
      one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when
      squeezing. The companion gains moderate fortification.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice for a given companion. If taken twice,
      your companion gains heavy fortification, and your companion can engulf
      creatures in its path. As a standard action, the companion may move up to
      its speed and attempt to engulf any creature smaller than itself that is
      in its path. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it
      engulfs. The companion merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as
      many as it can cover.</p>

      <p>Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the
      companion, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw
      against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity
      can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Strength modifier) to
      avoid being engulfed&#8212;on a success, they are pushed back or aside
      (companion&#8217;s choice) as the companion moves forward. Engulfed
      creatures gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are
      trapped within the companion&#8217;s body until they are no longer pinned,
      and take slam damage from the companion each round (1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small
      if no slam attack is possessed). An engulfed creature may attempt to
      escape as if escaping a pin.</p>
