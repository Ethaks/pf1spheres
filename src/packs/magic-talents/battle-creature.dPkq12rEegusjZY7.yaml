      <p>Your companion is learned in the ways of war. It gains proficiency with
      all simple weapons and when summoned, appears with up to 2 weapons it is
      proficient with (masterwork, but of unremarkable composition). These
      weapons gain a +1 enhancement bonus for every 3 Hit Dice possessed to a
      maximum of +5. A companion may gain this form talent twice. If gained a
      second time, it gains proficiency with all martial weapons and treats its
      Hit Dice as fighter levels when meeting the prerequisites for feats.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If using Spheres of Might, companions with
      Battle Creature (form) may take <a href="/martial-traditions">martial
      traditions</a> instead of proficiency with all martial weapons.</p>
