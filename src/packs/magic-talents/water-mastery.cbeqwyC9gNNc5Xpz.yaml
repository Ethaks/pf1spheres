      <p>Your mastery of water is delicate and intricate. You may manipulate
      snow as if it were liquid water.</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain the following geomancing abilities:</p>

      <p><strong>Air Bubble:</strong> Concentration, requires both water and
      air, meaning it usually must be used at the water&#8217;s surface. You may
      fold water in such a way that it traps air inside of it. This can take one
      of two forms: You may create either an individual air bubble around a
      creature&#8217;s head, or create a large bubble measuring up to 5 feet + 5
      feet per 5 caster levels in radius. You may move this bubble as if it were
      a Vortex. An individual air bubble allows a creature to breathe underwater
      for 1 hour normally, but otherwise does not impede swimming. A larger air
      bubble traps significantly more air, and allows those inside to remain dry
      and walk on the ground at the bottom of the body of water as if it were
      ground. A large air bubble contains enough air for a Medium creature to
      breathe normally for 6 hours per 5 feet in the bubble&#8217;s radius.</p>

      <p><em>Slow Suffocation:</em> A medium character can breathe easily for 6
      hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that time,
      the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15 minutes. Each
      additional medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for
      example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. Once rendered
      unconscious through the accumulation of nonlethal damage, the character
      begins to take lethal damage at the same rate. Small characters consume
      half as much air as medium characters.</p>

      <p><strong>Push Swimmer:</strong> Instantaneous. You may move creatures
      and objects within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area that
      are surrounded or submerged in water up to 5 feet per 2 caster levels in
      any direction that ends with them still in water (Reflex negates if
      unwilling). A target slammed into a solid object suffers 1d6 falling
      damage per 10 feet of movement.</p>
