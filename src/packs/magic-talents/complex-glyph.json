      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere (Glyph), caster level 5th.</p>\n<p>When you create a glyph, you may substitute an ability that you possess from another sphere in place of a ward.</p>\n<p>This ability must either target an area, or must have the ability to attack creatures. When triggered, the glyph activates the ability. For an ability with a duration, it lasts for 1 round per caster level (even if the original duration of the ability was longer), while an instantaneous ability activates once against whomever triggered the glyph, or a random target within range if that is not applicable. You must pay the full spell point cost of the sphere ability the glyph contains. You do not need to pay a spell point to maintain an effect without concentration - the glyph maintains the effect as if it were concentrated on. A glyph cannot discern automatically between allies and enemies; only those who trigger them and those who have not. This extends to the substitute effects which normally would be able to distinguish between allies and enemies.</p>\n<p>If you possess the Cantrips feat, you may use any simple magical effect the Cantrips feat can create (such as a simple alarm, or having an illusionary mouth appear and deliver a short message) with the glyph instead of a sphere ability. Counterspell may also be substituted for a sphere ability. Similarly, you may add a non-magical trap (such as those constructed with the Craft skill) to a glyph in place of a sphere ability.</p>\n<p>A complex glyph uses your caster level with the sphere of the sphere ability to determine the effect of the sphere ability, but uses your Protection caster level to determine its own properties.</p>\n",
