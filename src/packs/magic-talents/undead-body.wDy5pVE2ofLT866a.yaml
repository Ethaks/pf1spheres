      <p>You may grant the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Undead Form:</strong> The target counts as an undead creature
      when determining if it is healed or harmed by positive or negative energy,
      such as from a cleric&#8217;s channel energy class feature or the Life
      sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Undead Resistances:</strong> The target gains a +2 racial bonus
      on saving throws against death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects,
      paralysis, poison, sleep, and stunning, increasing by +1 per 10 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Undead Skin:</strong> The target gains DR 5/bludgeoning or DR
      5/slashing. This improves by 1 per 5 caster levels. At 10th caster level,
      this may be changed to DR/silver or magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Blood Drain:</strong> At 10th caster level, the target may be
      granted the blood drain special quality (1d2 Constitution; this improves
      by 1 die size for each 5 caster levels beyond 10th).</p>

      <p><strong>Fear Aura:</strong> At 10th caster level, the target may be
      granted the fear aura special quality (30 feet, always active, creatures
      entering the area must succeed at a Will save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 Hit
      Dice + Charisma modifier or be shaken for as long as they are inside the
      aura; once a creature saves against this effect, they are immune for 24
      hours).</p>

      <p><strong>Incorporeal:</strong> You must spend an additional spell point
      and have at least 15th caster level to apply this trait. The target may be
      made incorporeal with the following modifications: The target retains all
      worn equipment not exceeding his maximum load as well as the benefits from
      any magic items that grant a continuous effect, but gains no benefit from
      physical armor or shields, and cannot make attacks against corporeal
      creatures unless using a weapon with the ghost touch special ability. The
      target takes half damage from non-magic weapons instead of no damage, and
      non-force effects originating from corporeal sources that do not deal
      damage have a 20% chance to fail instead of the normal 50%. The target
      uses normal movement speeds (treat moving through solid objects as ground
      movement), and in open air the target falls slowly, and may glide with a
      speed of 30 feet with maneuverability (perfect), falling 1 foot for every
      5 feet traveled (unless possessing a fly speed).</p>
