    value: >
      <p>You may create totems attached to objects. A totem attached to an
      object is called a totemic emblem. This functions as a regular totem,
      except that it has a radius of 30 feet, it moves with the object it is
      attached to, and is dispelled if the object is destroyed. totemic emblems
      continue to function if they go beyond long range of their creator, but
      the creator can only rally those within that totem if they are within long
      range.</p>

      <p>The recipient object must be within range (adjacent to you, or in close
      range if you possess the Ranged Totem talent). An unwilling creature can
      have a totem attached to its equipment as a touch attack; no saving throw
      is allowed, but the Break Enchantment talent from the Life sphere or a
      similar effect can dispel the totem before its natural duration
      expires.</p>

      <p>An object with a totem attached to it still receives any saving throws
      the totem allows to avoid being affected. A successful save means it is
      unaffected by the totem, but it remains attached to it and it still
      affects those within range of the totem.</p>

      <p>Spell resistance can prevent a totemic emblem from being attached to an
      object. Failing to bypass the intended target&#8217;s spell resistance in
      attempting to attach the totem dispels the totem.</p>
