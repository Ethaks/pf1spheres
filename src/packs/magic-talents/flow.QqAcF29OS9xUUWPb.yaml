      <p>As a manabond, you can create a magical stream between yourself and the
      recipient. Each round, as part of maintaining your manabond, you may
      choose to either funnel or sap the recipient of this manabond.</p>

      <p>When you funnel, you spend a spell point in order to grant the
      recipient a single spell point. If the creature is unwilling to be granted
      a spell point, you must succeed at a magic skill check. If you fail, no
      spell points are spent and the target does not gain spell points.</p>

      <p>When you sap, you must attempt a magic skill check against the
      recipient. On a success, they lose 1 spell point, as if you had used the
      Spellburn expunge, and you gain 1 temporary spell point. This does not
      grant you a spellpoint if the target did not lose a spellpoint.</p>

      <p>As long as a creature is a recipient of this manabond, you may choose
      to pay any spell point costs that a recipient may incur from using their
      class features or casting sphere effects with your own spell points,
      either partially or in whole. Any spell points granted from this talent
      stack with themselves.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Magical Conduit talent, you can grant any spell
      points gained from sapping to any other creature that is a recipient of
      your manabonds.</p>
