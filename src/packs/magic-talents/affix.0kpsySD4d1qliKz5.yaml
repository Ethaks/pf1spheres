      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere (Effortless
      Telekinesis (advanced), Idle Concentration), caster level 10th</p>

      <p>By spending two spell points, you may permanently affix a single object
      you are lifting with your telekinesis to a specific point in space. This
      is an instantaneous effect that binds the object to that specific point,
      preventing it from moving in any direction even due to gravity.</p>

      <p>An unwilling creature lifted through the use of Hostile Lift gains an
      immediate opportunity to break your telekinetic hold with a Will save. If
      the save fails they remain held by your telekinesis, and must attempt a
      Reflex save to avoid being fixed in place permanently with no further
      saves. A creature affected by Affix can still take actions and can freely
      move their limbs, but cannot move away from the point they have been
      affixed to, even with teleportation effects.</p>

      <p>Since this is an instantaneous effect, it cannot be dispelled. However,
      a successful application of telekinesis or brute force can break an object
      free with a magic skill check or Strength check against your MSD + 4. If
      applying your own telekinesis against an object you have affixed, you
      automatically succeed on your magic skill check. This effect can also be
      ended by the Make Whole advanced talent from the Life sphere, the Freedom
      (word) from the Fate sphere, or the freedom of movement spell.</p>
