      <p>You may divine the presence of any diseases, poisons, or radiation
      within range. You determine whether any creature, object, or area has been
      poisoned, is poisonous, carries any sort of disease or infestation, or
      possesses any abilities which can inflict the sickened or nauseated
      conditions. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Wisdom
      check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft
      (alchemy) check if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy)
      check prior to the Wisdom check. If there is a disease present, you know
      what disease it is and its effects. You gain an insight bonus on Heal
      checks equal to half your caster level to treat a disease you divine with
      this sphere effect.</p>
