      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You gain the ability to allow a character to completely retrain the
      last class level they gained by returning them to an earlier point in
      time. You must spend 10 spell points and remain in physical contact with
      the target for 1 minute, at the end of which they may immediately retrain
      the last class level they gained, choosing a new class, feats, spells,
      skills, or other class options as appropriate. The target of this ability
      must still rest to regain any bardic performance rounds, rage rounds,
      spell points, spell slots, or other limited use abilities granted by this
      new class level.</p>
