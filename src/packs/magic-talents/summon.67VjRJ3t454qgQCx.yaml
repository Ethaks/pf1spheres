    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to summon a creature
      you have made a contract with (called a companion) causing it to appear in
      an adjacent square, ready to act on your following turn. You must
      concentrate to maintain the companion&#8217;s presence, but may always
      spend an additional spell point to allow the summoned creature to remain
      for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>Companions can take many forms; a caster could contract with
      sympathetic angels or demons, elemental spirits, or primordial beings only
      given form after the contract is made. Thus, a companion could have the
      form of a knight in armor, a demonic dog, a flying anthropomorphic cat, or
      indeed virtually any other form. You cannot choose a companion with the
      exact same appearance as another creature.</p>

      <p>When you gain the Conjuration sphere, you automatically gain a single
      companion of your choice. If a companion is conjured multiple times during
      a day, they do not regain hit points or other resources spent. If a
      companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they instantly disappear and cannot
      be summoned until the following day.</p>

      <p>A companion only recovers hit points and resources (unless restored
      through the Heal skill or magical means) when the caster rests to recover
      spell points. A companion may be dismissed as a free action.</p>

      <p>Companions may not carry equipment or items back and forth when
      summoned and so cannot be used to store items in their home plane or bring
      items to the caster&#8217;s plane. The exception to this rule is equipment
      gained through Conjuration talents, which automatically accompany the
      companion. Whenever you gain a companion, they immediately gain 1 (form)
      or (type) talent of your choice.</p>

      <p>Every companion comes with one of the following base forms, chosen by
      the caster. Once made, this choice cannot be altered. Companions also gain
      power as their caster&#8217;s power grows, according to Table:
      Companion.</p>

      <p>(Note: A companion does not gain power from temporary increases to
      caster level; i.e., from a thaumaturge&#8217;s forbidden lore ability or
      from certain boons.)</p>

      <p>Avian creatures are birds and bird-like magical beasts and outsiders.
      An avian companion has a head, 2 legs, and 2 wings</p>

      <p>*This fly speed only functions on the companion&#8217;s turn. If the
      companion is not on a surface that can support it on the end of its turn,
      it glides to the ground, taking no falling damage. If the companion gains
      a natural fly speed from the Avian Creature (form) talent, increase the
      maneuverability of that speed by 1 step.</p>

      <p>Orb creatures are lantern archons, will-o-wisps, gibbering orbs, and
      other mystical fey, outsiders, constructs, or aberrations with a floating
      sphere-like appearance and supernatural movement. An orb lacks any limbs,
      but may treat its body as a head for the purpose of adding natural
      attacks. An orb companion may not be tripped unless gaining legs from
      another source.<br>

      *An orb may float up to 5 feet plus 5 feet per 5 Hit Dice above the
      ground, with a horizontal movement speed of 30 feet. When floating this
      way, Fly checks are not required to hover or change direction. When
      falling the orb may choose to descend at a slower rate to control its fall
      and to negate all falling damage it would take. Each round it descends 30
      feet, and may move in another direction for 30 feet. It may choose to
      drift sideways, gliding forwards while descending, or down, safely
      increasing its rate of descent. It may even choose to drift
      &#8216;upwards&#8217; to reduce its rate of descent, even allowing it to
      negate it entirely and hover midair (though cannot move horizontally if it
      begins its turn doing so). This is a supernatural ability.<br>

      ^The Skillful Companion (form) talent increases Int to 13 if taken.</p>

      <h3 id="toc1"><span>Companion Features</span></h3>

      <p>You may choose to make a companion Small-sized instead of Medium-sized.
      In this case, the companion gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity, a -2 penalty to
      Strength, as well as the usual changes for being Small (+4 Stealth bonus,
      +1 AC, +1 to-hit, decreased damage size, etc.).</p>

      <p>A companion gains 2 skill points per level (reduced to 1 for low
      Intelligence) and gains the following class skills: Climb (Str), Fly
      (Dex), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str). They possess a
      d10 Hit Die and gain 2 good saves and 1 bad save dependent on the
      creature&#8217;s form. A companion begins understanding and speaking one
      language that the caster also speaks.</p>

      <p><strong>Feats:</strong> A companion begins with one feat, and gains
      another feat at every odd Hit Die. A companion may gain any PC or monster
      feat for which it qualifies. While a companion may gain casting abilities
      through feats such as Basic Magic Training or Advanced Magic Training, a
      companion can never possess the Conjuration sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Evasion:</strong> At 2 Hit Dice, a companion gains evasion,
      taking no damage on a successful Reflex save against an effect that grants
      half damage on a successful Reflex save. At 11 Hit Dice, they gain
      improved evasion, only take half damage on failed Reflex saves against
      effects that grant half damage on a successful Reflex save.</p>

      <p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Just like PCs and monsters, a
      companion gains a permanent +1 bonus to an ability score of the
      caster&#8217;s choice for every 4 Hit Dice possessed.</p>

      <p><strong>Devotion:</strong> At 5 Hit Dice, a companion gains a +4 morale
      bonus on Will saves against charm and enchantment effects, such as
      enchantment school spells or the Mind sphere.</p>

      <p><strong>Multiattack:</strong> At 7 Hit Dice, a companion gains
      Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has 3 or more natural attacks and does
      not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more
      natural attacks (or it is reduced to less than 3 attacks), the companion
      instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a
      &#8211;5 penalty. If the companion later gains 3 or more natural attacks,
      it loses this additional attack and instead gains Multiattack.</p>
