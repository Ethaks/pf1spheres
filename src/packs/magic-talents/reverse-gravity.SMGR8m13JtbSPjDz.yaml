      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere (Lighten (enhance)),
      caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to enhance an area of up to 1&#160;10-foot
      cube per caster level, arranged contiguously. Unlike most enhancements,
      you can only maintain this effect through concentration for up to 1 round
      per caster level. Spending an additional spell point to allow it to become
      self-sustaining lasts for 1 round per caster level, not 1 minute per
      caster level, and is unaffected by Deep Enhancement.</p>

      <p>Within this area, gravity reverses. Unattached objects and creatures in
      the area fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If a solid
      object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects
      and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal
      downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area
      without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until
      the effect ends. At the end of the duration, affected objects and
      creatures fall downward.</p>

      <p>Provided it has something to hold onto, a creature caught in the area
      can attempt a Reflex save to secure itself and not fall upward. Creatures
      who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling.</p>
