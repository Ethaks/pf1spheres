      <p>You may place a ghost strike of your choice onto an adjacent,
      unoccupied area up to one 5-foot square per two caster levels (minimum one
      5-foot square), that lashes out at the first creature who enter its area,
      similar to a haunt.</p>

      <p>The first creature who steps onto an affected square is affected by
      your ghost strike. If the ghost strike does not allow a saving throw, the
      creature affected is allowed a Will save to negate its effects. After
      activation, this haunt disappears.</p>

      <p>A haunting apparition lasts for 10 minutes per caster level before
      becoming inert. It shares your alignment, and its Perception DC and hit
      points are equal to its save DC. You may only have one active haunt
      apparition at a time; placing a second haunting apparition deactivates the
      first. You may select this talent multiple times. Each time it is taken,
      increase the number of haunting apparitions you may have active at once by
      1.</p>
