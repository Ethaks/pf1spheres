      "value": "<p>You may create a darkness effect that has a chance to disorient anyone who enters it. When a creature within this area attempts to move, or when a creature first enters this area, they must succeed at a Will save or become disoriented. A creature must attempt this Will save every time they enter the area of darkness. If the creature fails this saving throw, they must roll a d8 to determine direction: 1 is their intended direction, with 2-8 rotating around the creature in a clockwise direction. The target moves that direction as if it were their intended course. The target does not realize they are off-course until their next turn or until they leave the area of darkness.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent a total of three times. If taken twice, you gain a portion of control over your targets&#8217; delusions. When a creature that has failed it save against your disorienting darkness attempts to move, you may spend an immediate action to choose their direction of travel instead of rolling randomly.</p>\n<p>If taken three times, you gain even more influence over your victims. When a creature that has failed its save against your disorienting darkness makes an attack, casts a targeted spell or spell-like ability, or uses a supernatural or extraordinary ability with a specified target, the attack or ability is randomly directed to another legal target within range (excluding the attacker itself). If there is no other legal target within range, the attack or ability is not affected. If the affected spell or ability has more than one target, all its targets are randomly chosen from among the legal targets within range. Alternatively, you may select the new target or targets as an immediate action instead of determining them randomly. Chosen targets must be legal and you must be able to perceive them.</p>\n",
