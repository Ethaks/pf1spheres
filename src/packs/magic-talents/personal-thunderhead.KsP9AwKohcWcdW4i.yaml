      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, causing a small cloud to
      follow it and periodically strike it with lightning. Every time the target
      attempts to take a standard or full-round action, it takes electricity
      damage equal to 1d6 + your caster level (Reflex negates). This counts as
      taking place during the casting of a spell or the use of a sphere ability
      for the purpose of concentration checks. Each time the target fails a
      Reflex save against this shroud&#8217;s effects they must succeed at a
      Fortitude save or be deafened for one round.</p>
