      <p>You may plant thoughts into a target&#8217;s mind.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You may plant a suggestion in a
      target&#8217;s mind, which they obey as if the thought had been their own
      (Will negates). The suggested course of activity must be limited to a
      sentence or two and must be a very simple request. The creature performs
      the suggested action until it finishes, or for 1 hour per caster level,
      whichever comes first. If you choose, you can instead specify conditions
      the creature should look for, (i.e., &#8220;you should search the next
      person who enters this room, looking for weapons.&#8221;) If the condition
      is not met before this duration expires, the activity is not
      performed.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> This works as the lesser charm, but may
      be up to a basic request. Very simple requests cause the save to be made
      with a -2 penalty. The target cannot be asked to do anything it would not
      normally do.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This works as the lesser charm, but
      the creature obeys any course of action given, so long as the suggestion
      is not obviously fatal or against the target&#8217;s nature. Basic
      requests cause the save to be made with a -2 penalty, while very simple
      requests cause the save to be made with a -4 penalty.</p>
