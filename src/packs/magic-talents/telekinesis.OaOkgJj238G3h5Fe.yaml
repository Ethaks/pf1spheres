      <p>As a standard action, you can use telekinesis to lift one willing
      creature or unattended object within close range and move it up to 20 feet
      + 5 feet per 5 caster levels (its telekinesis speed). The creature or
      object levitates as long as you concentrate, have line of effect, and the
      object remains within close range. The objects and creatures you may lift
      are restricted by size; the largest creature or object you can lift is
      given in the chart below. This assumes the creature or object is made from
      a dense material, such as flesh creatures or stone objects.</p>

      <p>Creatures or objects made of lighter materials, mostly open space, or
      reduced to 1/2 weight with the Lighten talent of the Enhancement sphere
      count as being one size category smaller, while weightless creatures or
      objects count as being 2 size categories smaller for this purpose.</p>

      <p>Your telekinesis is simple and cannot perform dexterous actions (tying
      a knot, opening a book, turning a key, etc.). Any object you control with
      telekinesis has a touch AC of 10 + your casting ability modifier + any
      size modifier, and a CMD of 10 + your caster level + your casting ability
      modifier + the object&#8217;s size modifier. If ever a Strength check is
      required (such as a creature trying to battle you for control of an item),
      you may use your casting ability modifier as your Strength modifier for
      that purpose. If another target attempts to use telekinesis on something
      you are already affecting with telekinesis, they must overcome your MSD
      first, or the attempt fails.</p>

      <p>The following special rules apply to certain activities you may perform
      with telekinesis:</p>
