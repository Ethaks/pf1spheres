      "value": "<p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>\n<p><strong>Collateral Damage:</strong> Whenever a creature misses you with a melee attack, you may redirect the attack to another creature within the attacking creature&#8217;s reach as an immediate action. Make a new attack roll with the original bonus to determine the result.</p>\n<p><strong>Jinx:</strong> As a standard action, you can place a curse on a single creature within close range. A Will save negates the effect. On a failed save, the target is cursed for the duration of your fey-link. The victim of the curse takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill and ability checks until the curse is removed. This penalty increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. A creature can only be affected by a single jinx at one time. This is a curse effect. A creature that succeeds on the save against this effect is immune to that caster&#8217;s use of it for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Pugwampi&#8217;s Aura:</strong> All hostile creatures within 30 feet of you take a -1 penalty to all saving throws. This penalty increases by -1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. A creature benefiting from any luck bonus ignores this penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Stymie Channeling:</strong> Any hostile creature that attempts to channel energy within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Will save or be unable to channel for that round. The use is not lost, but the action is wasted.</p>\n",
