    value: >
      <p>Whenever you would have damage dealt to you that is completely negated
      through damage reduction, energy resistance, or energy immunity, you may
      use a Life sphere ability as an immediate action on any willing creature
      within range. This sphere ability costs spell points as normal. You cannot
      benefit from this talent as a result of an effect dealing damage to you if
      you have previously used that effect to trigger this talent within the
      last minute (for example, if you negated fire damage from
      alchemist&#8217;s fire, you would only activate this ability the first
      time that particular instance of alchemist&#8217;s fire damaged you. You
      could activate this talent again if you negated damage from another vial
      of alchemist&#8217;s fire or a breath weapon that deals fire damage next
      turn).</p>
