    value: >
      <p>Choose one of the following creature types: animal, plant, or vermin.
      As a standard action you may command one creature of that type within 30
      feet of you whose CR does not exceed your caster level. If the creature
      fails a Will save, its disposition toward you increases to helpful for the
      duration of the fey-blessing. Mindless creatures and creatures of animal
      intelligence (Intelligence 2 or lower) can be given simple commands as a
      swift action and will obey your orders even if dangerous or suicidal.
      Creatures of higher intelligence will fight for you and defend you, but
      will not obey suicidal orders. You may have multiple instances of this
      fey-blessing active simultaneously, but you may only command a single
      creature at a time; attempting to command a new creature, even of a
      different type, dismisses your influence on any previous creature,
      returning it to its previous disposition. This is a mind-affecting
      compulsion that bypasses the type-based immunity to mind-affecting effects
      granted by the plant and vermin types. A creature that succeeds on its
      save against this ability becomes immune to that caster&#8217;s use of it
      for 24 hours.</p>
