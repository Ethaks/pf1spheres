    value: >
      <p>You may create an aegis that grants the target a +4 morale bonus to
      saving throws against all fear, emotional and mind-affecting abilities,
      both magical or mundane. When the target is affected by a magical ability
      this bonus applies to, they are always granted a save to completely negate
      the effect, even if one is not normally allowed. The improved composure of
      the subject also grants them a +4 morale bonus to Bluff checks to conceal
      emotions or relay secret messages, and to Diplomacy checks to influence
      attitudes to make creatures calm.</p>
