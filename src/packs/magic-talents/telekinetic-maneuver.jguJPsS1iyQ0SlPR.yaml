      <p>You can use telekinesis to manipulate a target with more finesse than a
      Hostile Lift. You may target a creature with telekinesis to perform a bull
      rush, drag, reposition, trip, dirty trick, or grapple (upgrades to pin if
      the target is already grappled) combat maneuver against a target, ignoring
      size limitations. Use your caster level plus your casting ability modifier
      as your CMB. If grappling, your CMD is your telekinesis CMB + 10 and the
      target is allowed to attempt a Will save each round after the grapple is
      initiated to negate the effect, just as they can with Hostile Lift. These
      maneuvers do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target. If
      grappling, you do not gain the grappled condition, and you cannot be
      knocked prone by failing a trip check.</p>
