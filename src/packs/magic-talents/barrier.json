      "value": "<p>You may create a ward that creates a mostly-transparent wall of force at its perimeter. While this barrier does not block line of sight, it does block line of effect; thus, while you could still target a creature through the barrier (such as for an attack that attempts to break the barrier and still deal damage to the creature on the other side), the barrier does stop attacks, movement, breath weapons, and any spells or sphere effects that rely on line of effect until the barrier is destroyed. Ethereal creatures are technically stopped by the barrier, but can usually find a way around it (as the barrier does not cut through objects, and so usually stops at ground level). Creatures inside a space where a barrier is created are shunted to the nearest empty space on the outside.</p>\n<p>A barrier has hit points equal to twice your caster level and a Break DC of 15 + 1/2 your caster level. A barrier can hold weight, up to 2,400 lbs. + 250 lbs. per caster level; beyond that, a barrier simply shatters as if broken with a Strength check. If a barrier is broken anywhere, the entire effect ends.</p>\n<p>If an attack is directed at a target through the barrier, the attack first deals its damage to the barrier itself. If this damage is enough to destroy the barrier, the attack continues on to its intended target, although damage dealt to the barrier is subtracted from any damage done to the target or targets. Burst-effect attacks such as splash weapons, fireball spells, or others attempting to travel through the barrier explode at the barrier&#8217;s edge and also must overcome the barrier&#8217;s hit points to damage targets on the other side. If you maintain your barrier through concentration, its hit points are renewed each round on your turn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span>Protection Talent Types</span></h3>\n<p>Certain protection talents grant you additional aegises or wards, and are marked (aegis) or (ward) respectively.</p>\n",
