      "value": "<p>As a standard action you may spend a spell point to have a target&#8217;s shadow split off from them and form a shadow lurk that acts as an independent creature unwaveringly loyal to you for 10 minutes per caster level. A shadow lurk appears as a shaded, obviously spurious version of the target. It is weightless and its equipment is entirely illusionary. It has the same skills, feats, and attributes as the target, except that its Strength score is 3, and only has a number of hit points equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p>The shadow lurk cannot attack, use extraordinary or supernatural abilities, cast spells or use spell-like abilities, or employ its target&#8217;s class features, though it can manipulate objects and use skills. A shadow lurk must remain within long range of its original source or it ceases to exist. The target lacks a shadow while this effect is active.</p>\n<p>Retracting a shadow lurk is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Either the target or the shadow lurk may spend this action. If a shadow lurk is killed or exceeds its range, it winks out of existence and the target&#8217;s shadow returns to them with a surge of energy that causes them to be stunned for 1 round. In either case, the target immediately gains the knowledge of everything their shadow lurk observed and did while it was detached.</p>\n<p>You may gain this talent a total of twice. If gained a second time, you may weave shadowstuff into your shadow lurks, giving them and their equipment increased substance. Your shadow lurks use the full Strength score of their source, have 2 hit points per caster level, and possess non-magical versions of their sources&#8217; equipment. It may flank, threaten, and make a single attack per turn using non-magical versions of whatever weapons or natural attacks its source possesses. It attacks using its source&#8217;s full base attack bonus, Strength score, feats, and proficiencies, but deals only half damage. A shadowstuff-imbued shadow lurk may not attempt non-attack combat maneuvers, cast spells, or use its source&#8217;s class features. Alchemical items created as part of your shadow lurks do not function.</p>\n",
