    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that imposes 1
      temporary negative level on the target for one hour per caster level (no
      save). This increases by 1 die size per 5 caster levels (1d2, 1d3, 1d4,
      and 1d6). Unlike with other ghost strikes, negative levels stack. While
      normally negative levels have a chance to become permanent and can kill a
      target whose negative levels equal its Hit Dice, these negative levels do
      not last long enough to become permanent, and if a negative level from
      this ghost strike would reduce the creature to 0 Hit Dice, the creature
      instead takes 4 points of Constitution drain for the duration of the
      effect. If a negative level lasts longer than 1 day, the target must
      succeed at a Fortitude save per negative level or have the negative level
      become permanent. If this ability is used on an undead creature, it
      instead grants the creature 5 temporary hit points per negative level,
      which last for 1 hour.</p>
