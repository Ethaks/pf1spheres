      <p><strong>Affect Fire:</strong> Concentration, requires fire. You may
      affect a normal, non-magical fire, increasing or decreasing its size by
      one category, plus one per 5 caster levels. This is only a temporary
      change; once the effect ends, the fire returns to its normal size.
      Reducing a fire smaller than Fine extinguishes it, in which case it does
      not return to normal size after the effect ends. The fire consumes fuel
      and deals damage as appropriate for its new size, according to Table:
      Maximum Fire Size. Creatures caught in the fire's area are allowed a
      Reflex save for half damage. The minimum caster level required to affect a
      fire is also given in the chart. If two casters are affecting the same
      fire in the same direction (increasing or decreasing) only the strongest
      change occurs. If two casters attempt to Affect Fire in opposite
      directions (one making it bigger, one making it smaller), the second
      caster must succeed at a magic skill check. On a success, their ability
      functions normally, overlapping the first caster&#8217;s effect. The fire
      counts as its altered size for determining if the second caster can affect
      it.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span> If multiple
      fires overlap, or if a Large or larger creature is affected by multiple
      smaller fires within its area at once, these fires combine to determine
      the effective size of the fire when determining damage (2 Small fires make
      1 Medium fire, 2 Medium fires make 1 Large fire, etc.).</p>

      <p>If a creature has caught on fire, treat that fire as being Tiny-sized
      for the purpose of this effect. When you affect a fire on a creature, you
      also raise or lower the Reflex save DC to put the fire out by 1/2 your
      caster level (minimum 0).</p>

      <p><strong>Create Fire:</strong> Concentration, no requirements. You may
      produce a Diminutive-sized magical fire that burns without fuel. This fire
      may be 1 size category larger per 5 caster levels, and may be used to
      ignite flammable materials to create self-sustaining, non-magical fire. If
      a target is within the area of the created fire, they suffer damage as
      normal for that fire&#8217;s size and catch fire. A successful Reflex save
      halves the damage and negates catching fire.</p>

      <p><strong>Manipulate Lava:</strong> Instantaneous or concentration,
      requires lava. You may manipulate lava. This is exactly the same as the
      Freeze and Vortex powers from the (water) package, except you must spend
      an additional spell point for each ability, and you must target lava.
      Frozen lava becomes obsidian, with a hardness of 5 and 3 hit points per
      caster level and does not deal damage per round to trapped creatures.</p>
