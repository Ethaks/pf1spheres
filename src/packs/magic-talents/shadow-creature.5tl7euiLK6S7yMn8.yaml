      <p>Your companion is a being made of shadow. It gains darkvision 60 feet,
      low-light vision, and a +8 racial bonus to Stealth checks made in dim
      light or darkness. Your companion takes half damage from attacks and magic
      originating from corporeal creatures and only deals half damage to
      corporeal creatures with its own attacks and magic. However, your
      companion deals full damage to incorporeal creatures and suffers full
      damage from incorporeal creatures.</p>
