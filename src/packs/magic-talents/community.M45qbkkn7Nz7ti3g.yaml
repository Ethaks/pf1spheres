      <p>So long as you are on the same plane and are aware of it happening,
      whenever a creature under one of your aegises takes damage, you may spend
      a spell point as a free action (usable outside your turn) to transfer up
      to half of that damage to any other creature under one of your aegises.
      Damage transferred by this talent may not be resisted or redirected
      further.</p>
