    value: >
      <p>Your companion gains either darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, or
      the scent ability. If your companion possesses darkvision from another
      source, increase its range by 30 feet. If it already possesses the scent
      ability, it may either increase its range to 60 feet or gain the keen
      scent ability.</p>

      <p><em>Keen Scent:</em> The companion can notice other creatures by scent
      in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at
      ranges of up to a mile.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if you or your companion possesses any of the following
      spheres, you may choose the following special senses instead of one listed
      above:</p>

      <p><strong>Dark Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain the see in
      darkness ability. You must spend 1 additional spell point as part of your
      summon to grant your companion the benefit from this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Life Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain lifesense 30
      feet. The creature notices and locates living creatures within range, just
      as if it possessed the blindsight ability. You must spend 2 additional
      spell points as part of your summon to grant your companion the benefit of
      this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Mind Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain thoughtsense 30
      feet. This ability functions similarly to blindsight. Nondetection, mind
      blank, and similar effects can block thoughtsense. Thoughtsense can
      distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and nonsentient
      (Intelligence 1-2) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about
      the creatures it detects. You must spend 2 additional spell points as part
      of your summon to grant your companion the benefit of this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Nature Sphere ((earth) package):</strong> Your companion may
      either gain the ability to see through up to 5 feet of dirt and stone or
      gain tremorsense 30 feet. You must spend 1 additional spell point as part
      of your summon to grant your companion tremorsense. A companion with
      tremorsense is sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically
      pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground.
      Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of
      creatures moving through water.</p>

      <p><strong>Nature Sphere ((fire) package):</strong> Your companion may
      gain the ability to see through both magical and mundane smoke, ignoring
      the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of
      vision.</p>

      <p><strong>Nature Sphere ((metal) package):</strong> Your companion gains
      the scent metal ability. This ability functions much the same as the scent
      ability, except that the range is 90 feet and the companion can only use
      it to sense metal objects (including creatures wearing or carrying metal
      objects). If the companion already has the scent ability, increase the
      range of this ability by the companion&#8217;s scent range.</p>

      <p><strong>Nature Sphere ((plant) package):</strong> Your companion can
      see through thick plant matter as though it were transparent, with a range
      of 30 feet. Leaves, vines, greenery, and undergrowth offer no concealment
      to the companion&#8217;s sight, though solid wood still blocks its line of
      sight.</p>

      <p><strong>Nature Sphere ((water) package):</strong> Your companion may
      see through fog, mist, and murky water as if they were perfectly clear,
      ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of
      vision.</p>

      <p><strong>Telekinesis Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain touchsight
      30 feet. You must spend 2 additional spell points as part of your summon
      to grant your companion the benefit from this ability. Your companion may
      ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment, though it must have line
      of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. It does not need to
      attempt Perception checks to notice creatures; it can detect and pinpoint
      all creatures within 30 feet.</p>

      <p>A companion may gain this talent multiple times. Each time it gains
      this talent, select a new sense or increase the range of their darkvision
      by 30 feet. If a selected ability requires an additional spell point cost,
      the caster must choose to grant the ability and pay the cost each time the
      companion is summoned.</p>
