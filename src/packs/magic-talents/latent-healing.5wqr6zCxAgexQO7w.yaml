      <p>When you use cure or invigorate on a target, you may choose to delay
      its effects. You may apply effects that add additional hit points of
      healing at the time of the initial cure, such as additional hit points
      from Fount Of Life. At any point within 1 hour per caster level, the
      subject of the effect can trigger its effects as a swift action. A target
      can only be under the effects of one latent healing at a time.</p>
