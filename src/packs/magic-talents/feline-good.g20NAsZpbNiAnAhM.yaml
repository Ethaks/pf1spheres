      <p>The recipients of your life magic are momentarily protected by your
      affection and care, the harsh effects momentarily stalled as your magic
      gently caresses them.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere (Lingering Resilience),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>As a special application of restore, instead of removing a condition
      from the target, you grant the target a protective mark for 1 minute per
      caster level. The next time the target would be affected by a negative
      condition, the protective mark&#8217;s duration immediately ends and the
      target delays the onset of the negative condition for a number of rounds
      equal to 1/4 your caster level (minimum 1). A negative condition delayed
      by this effect must be one that could be removed with a restore sphere
      effect or the Break Enchantment talent; rounds spent delaying the negative
      condition do not count toward the negative condition&#8217;s duration (for
      example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds,
      even if the target delayed its effect several rounds). A creature cannot
      have more than one protective mark from this talent at one time.</p>

      <p>The spell point cost of a restore effect modified by this talent is
      reduced by 1 sp (minimum 0). If you spend an additional spell point, you
      may use this talent as an immediate action; however, the duration of a
      protective mark applied as part of a swift or immediate action is reduced
      to 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Life sphere Resurrection
      advanced talent, this talent may delay an effect which would immediately
      kill the target through non-hit point damage (such as some death effects);
      the target dies normally after this effect&#8217;s duration ends.</p>
