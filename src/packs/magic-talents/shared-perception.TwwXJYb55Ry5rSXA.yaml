    value: >
      <p>You may spend 2 spell points, instead of 1, to grant a special sense to
      two touched creatures. The maximum number of targets increase by +1 per 5
      caster levels. As long as the targets remain within long range of each
      other, the first target shares perception with the second, and vice versa.
      This grants the targets the ability to see, smell, hear, etc. whatever the
      other targets do. This sense, while not requiring line of sight, is
      blocked by dense materials just like the divine ability. Once created,
      each character is considered to be under a unique sense effect.</p>
