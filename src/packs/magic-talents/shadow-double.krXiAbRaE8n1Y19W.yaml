      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Animated Shadow (advanced,
      shadow), Shadow Lurk (shadow)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 3 spell points as a standard action to split off your
      shadow to act as an independent creature unwaveringly loyal to you for one
      hour per caster level. Your shadow double has the same attributes and
      statistics as you do, but half as many hit points, and its copies of your
      equipment are entirely non-magical.</p>

      <p>If it removes or drops its copied equipment, it disappears after 1
      round. You may give your shadow double additional equipment to use,
      including magical equipment, but you share one set of magic item slots and
      may not both benefit from an item in the same slot. It casts spells and
      uses spell-like abilities as you do, but you both draw from the same pool
      of spell points, spell-like abilities, spell slots, and memorized spells.
      Your shadow double may move any distance from you as long as it remains on
      the same plane of existence.</p>

      <p>You do not cast a shadow while this ability is active, nor may you use
      or be the target of any abilities or talents that affect your shadow while
      your shadow double is active.</p>

      <p>Reattaching your shadow double is a move action that does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. Either you or your shadow double may spend this
      action. If your shadow double is killed or removed from the same plane of
      existence as you, it winks out of existence and drops any non-copied
      equipment or items it is carrying, and your shadow returns with a surge of
      energy that causes you to be stunned for 1d4 rounds. In either case, you
      immediately gain the knowledge of everything your shadow double observed
      and did while it was detached.</p>
