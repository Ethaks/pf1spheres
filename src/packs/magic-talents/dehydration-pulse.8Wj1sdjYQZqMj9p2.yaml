      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weather sphere (Desert Lord
      (advanced)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>While within an area with Aridity of severity level 2 or higher, you
      may as a standard action (but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds)
      spend 2 spell points to draw in the moisture from an area in a 20-foot
      radius surrounding yourself. Plantlife within the area dies, beds of water
      are drained, and living creatures within range (other than you) take 1d6
      points of damage per caster level and are staggered for 1d4 rounds. A
      successful Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the staggered
      effect. Oozes, plants, and creatures with the aquatic or water subtype
      take double damage from this effect.</p>
