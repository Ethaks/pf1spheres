      <p>When using the bear strength bearacteristic and successfully striking a
      corporeal target, you may spend an additional spell point to compare the
      result of your attack roll to your opponent&#8217;s CMD. If your attack
      roll is higher, the target is knocked flying 10 ft. in a single direction
      of your choice and falls prone. The target cannot move closer to you than
      its starting square, and if an obstacle prevents the completion of the
      target&#8217;s move, it strikes the obstacle and each take 1d6 points of
      damage before the target falls prone in an adjacent space.</p>
