      <p>You may alter or create non-magical fires with your normal limitations
      on size, as if it were an object. When creating objects, you may create
      the object already on fire. Flaming objects deal 1d6 fire damage to any
      creature who touches the object, such as by having it dropped on them or
      used as a weapon against them. You may also light the terrain on fire or
      summon burning materials as a form of hazardous terrain. This behaves and
      deals damage as a fire created by the Nature sphere instead of as normal
      for hazardous terrain. A fire that has insufficient fuel quickly burns
      itself out if not maintained through concentration.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may spend a spell point to create non-magical
      electricity. However, with no battery or other way to store electricity,
      the energy quickly dissipates. Electricity must be generated directly on a
      creature or object (not simply in a square) and instead of being
      calculated by size, is instead calculated by its charge, with 1 charge
      being equal to a Medium object. If used on a battery or other electrical
      storage object, the charges are stored safely. If used on any other
      creature or object, it instead deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per
      charge to the creature or object (Reflex negates). If the creature or
      object is made from a conductive material such as flesh or metal, targets
      touching the electrified creature or object (including touching the same
      body of water) are also affected, but the electricity loses 1d6 for every
      10 feet the electricity must travel to reach these targets from the
      specific square designated as the center of the electricity (for example,
      if electrocuting a metal floor, all targets touching the floor would be
      affected, so long as they are close enough the damage is not reduced to
      0).</p>

      <p>The charge deals damage again each round at the beginning of your turn,
      with the charge reducing by 1 each round. If affecting a creature or their
      attended objects, they may ground themselves or the object as a move
      action, harmlessly dissipating any charges that remain. Creating
      electricity is an instantaneous effect, and you cannot create an object
      charged with electricity as you can create an object on fire.</p>

      <p>Repairing plasma restores it to the size (for fire) or stored energy
      (for electricity) it had in the previous round. This allows a fire to
      retain its size indefinitely without fuel so long as it is repaired every
      round. Destroying a plasma reduces its size or stored energy by 1 size
      category or 1d6 points of damage for every 5 points of damage dealt to
      it.</p>

      <p>If you use Change Material to turn an object into a plasma which
      dissipates entirely before the duration expires, then the object is
      destroyed when it regains its normal form. Otherwise, when the duration
      expires, the object reverts to its previous form with no apparent
      difference or damage that was not preexisting.</p>
