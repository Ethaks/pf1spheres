      <p>You may bend the light produced by your glows, allowing you to create
      spaces untouched by their light. When you cause a glow to shed normal or
      bright light, you may choose a number of 5-foot cubes in the area of light
      it produces, up to a maximum of 1 +1 per 2 caster levels. These cubes do
      not need to be contiguous. The selected area is unaffected by your glow;
      its light level does not change, and it is not subject to the effects of
      any (light) talents applied to the glow. If the glow moves, this omitted
      area moves with it. You may alter what areas are affected and unaffected
      by your light as a free action.</p>
