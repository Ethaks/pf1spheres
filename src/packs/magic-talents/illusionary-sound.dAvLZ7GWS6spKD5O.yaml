      <p>You may add whatever sounds you desire to an illusion. You cannot make
      more sound than four normal humans per caster level could make. (A horde
      of rats running and squeaking is equal to eight humans running and
      shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a
      roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans.)</p>

      <p>As a trick, you may create effects of non-specific noises (feet
      marching, laughing and muttering of a party) or throw your voice, making
      it appear as if it comes from somewhere else within your range. Targets
      are allowed a Will save as usual to disbelieve these sounds, or recognize
      your voice is not actually coming from where it appears to be.</p>
