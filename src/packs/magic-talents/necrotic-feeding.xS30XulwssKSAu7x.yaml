    value: >
      <p>You may make a ghost strike that causes a living creature that is below
      0 hit points but stabilized to resume dying. You may also spend a spell
      point to make a ghost strike that, when it strikes a target below 0 hit
      points, kills it instantly (Will negates).</p>

      <p>If the target fails their saving throw, you gain temporary hit points
      equal to twice the target&#8217;s Hit Dice, as well as a +2 enhancement
      bonus to Strength and Dexterity, which increases by +2 for every 8 Hit
      Dice the target possesses. These effects last for 10 minutes per Hit Die
      of the slain creature. Bonuses from multiple creatures do not stack; only
      the highest bonuses apply.</p>
