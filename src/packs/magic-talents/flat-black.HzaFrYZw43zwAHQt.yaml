    value: >
      <p>Your blot causes its area of effect to appear as a flat, featureless
      plane of blackness, masking any terrain, traps, or unattended objects
      within at the time it is cast. Some types of terrain may easily be deduced
      from context (e.g., a river flowing in one side and out the other). This
      talent does not hide creatures or hamper attempts at non-visual detection.
      The DCs for all vision- based Perception checks to find something obscured
      by Flat Black are increased by 10. Darkvision does not pierce Flat Black
      unless augmented with the Clearsight meld.</p>
