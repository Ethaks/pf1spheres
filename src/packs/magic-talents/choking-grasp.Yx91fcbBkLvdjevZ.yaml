      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere (Telekinetic Crush),
      caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>As either a stand-alone standard action or as part of maintaining a
      Hostile Lift, you may spend 2 spell points to suffocate a target within
      your telekinesis range. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or
      have its hit points drop to 0 and fall unconscious on its next turn as if
      it had failed a Constitution check against suffocation. Next round, the
      target must succeed at a second Fortitude save or drop to -1 hit points
      begin dying.</p>

      <p>In the round following that they must succeed at another Fortitude save
      or suffocate and die. Succeeding on any of these saves prevents further
      saves and stops the effects from worsening, but does not negate the
      effects of any previously failed saves. This talent only affects living
      creatures that must breathe.</p>
