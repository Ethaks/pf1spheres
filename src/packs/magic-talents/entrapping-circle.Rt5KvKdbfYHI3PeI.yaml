      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere (Call Planar
      Creature (advanced)).</p>

      <p>By spending 2 spell points as a standard action, you may select a
      creature within close range which you could call using Call Planar
      Creature. That creature must succeed at a Will save or become trapped as
      if it had been called using Call Planar Creature. Creatures trapped in
      this way are always considered hostile and may be contained or bargained
      with as normal. If you possess the Diagram advanced talent, you may spend
      an additional spell point to apply its effects to a trap created using
      this talent without spending any additional time.</p>
