      <p>When you cause a creature to glow, you may choose to make that target
      dazzled, giving it a -1 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to create bright light that blinds the
      glowing target and all creatures within the area of bright light. All
      creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. They
      must attempt this saving throw each round they are within this area.
      Creatures who succeed at their saving throw are still dazzled for that
      round.</p>
