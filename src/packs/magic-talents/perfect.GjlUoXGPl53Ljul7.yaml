      <p>You may spend a spell point to place a word on a creature that enhances
      its existing strengths. Choose an ability score. The target gains a +1
      bonus to ability checks and skill checks based on that ability score. In
      addition, the target gains a benefit for the chosen ability score as
      detailed on the table below.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend
      a spell point to allow the effect to endure for 1 minute per caster level
      without concentration.</p>

      bull rush, overrun, or trip maneuver. If the target can already perform
      one of these combat maneuvers without provoking an attack of opportunity,
      they instead gain a +2 bonus to combat maneuver checks to perform that
      maneuver. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 caster levels.</td>

      they move the first square is not considered threatened by any enemy. This

      round by taking a -10 penalty.</td>
