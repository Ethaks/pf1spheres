      <p>You gain a competence bonus on Craft checks equal to your caster level
      for items primarily composed of wood and may craft such objects as if you
      had the appropriate tools.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to turn an adequately
      sized piece of wood (including wood from a living plant) into 50 pieces of
      ammunition, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or a weapon normally
      primarily composed of wood. A weapon that normally would have a metal
      head, spike, or blade has its damage die reduced by one size. You must
      succeed on the appropriate Craft check to make the chosen item as part of
      this action or else the item gains the broken condition, though you may
      attempt to shape it again. The item is considered masterwork and, if a
      weapon or suit of armor, gains an enhancement bonus equal to your caster
      level/5 (minimum 0).</p>

      <p>Equipment made this way returns to its original form when your fey-link
      ends. Using special types of wood imparts the properties of that wood to
      the shaped object. If using wood from a living plant, the plant takes
      damage equal to the hit points of the item (before enhancement), ignoring
      hardness and dealing full damage to objects, which can be restored by
      putting the item back in place and dismissing the effect as a standard
      action. If an entire plant was used, it may be planted in a suitable
      location and the effect dismissed.</p>

      <p>You can spend a spell point as a standard action to restore 1d6 +
      caster level hit points to an object made primarily of wood or to a
      creature of the plant type.</p>
