    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a ward that represses all magic
      within its area of effect. Attempt one magic skill check against each
      magical effect, magic item, or summoned creature within the area. Magic
      items have a MSD of 10 + their caster level. If your check exceeds the MSD
      of the magical effect, item, or caster who summoned the creature, the
      effect is suppressed, the magic item ceases to function, or the summoned
      creature temporarily disappears. Time spent suppressed counts toward a
      magical effect&#8217;s total duration. Any caster attempting to use a
      magical ability in or targeted within this area, or any summoned creature
      attempting to enter this area, must attempt a magic skill check against
      your MSD. On a success, the magical effect is unimpeded, and the summoned
      creature is not banished by that Spell Ward. This counts as an antimagic
      field for effects that interact with them.</p>

      <p>You may also spend 2 spell points instead of 1 to create an aegis that
      grants the target spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level.</p>
