      <p>You may apply the following trait to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Bestial Mind:</strong> The target must succeed at a Will save
      or have their mind become bestial. Their Intelligence is reduced to 2, and
      they are treated as an animal for skills such as Handle Animal and
      Diplomacy. While the target has an Intelligence score of 2 or less they
      cannot use any spells, skills based on mental ability scores, or magic
      sphere abilities, although they retain other aspects of their class levels
      such as base attack bonus and any other abilities.</p>
