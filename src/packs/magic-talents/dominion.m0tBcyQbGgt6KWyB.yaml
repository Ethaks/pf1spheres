      <p>New to The Gravecaller&#8217;s Handbook is an update and errata to a
      number of talents that previously used or interacted with the
      Master&#8217;s Presence talent, primarily to use its range if you
      possessed the talent, or a default range otherwise. This change
      standardizes the range of these talents to close range and taking the
      Ranged Death talent can increase this range, instead of needing to take
      Master&#8217;s Presence additional times.</p>

      <p>This handbook has added the (dominion) descriptor to the following
      talents and advanced talent in addition to other minor changes:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Dark Sacrifice (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 269)</li>

      <li>Master&#8217;s Presence (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 270)</li>

      <li>Reanimated Warriors (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 270)</li>

      <li>Shroud (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 270)</li>

      <li>Undead Whisperer (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 271)</li>

      <li>Corpse Forge (advanced talent) (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg.
      393)</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Some Death talents are designated (dominion), which grant you new ways
      to interact with your raised and controlled undead. (Dominion) talents
      have a range of close.</p>
