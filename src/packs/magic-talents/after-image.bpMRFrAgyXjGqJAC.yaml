    value: >
      <p>You may cause a target to bleed through time, blurring their image so
      that they appear to be in multiple places at once. This grants the target
      concealment (20% miss chance) against attacks, +5% per 3 caster levels to
      a maximum of 50%. This is a blur effect, and may be counteracted by
      abilities that specify they can see through them. Opponents that cannot
      see the subject ignore this penalty, although fighting an unseen opponent
      carries penalties of its own.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, although you may spend a
      spell point as a free action to allow this effect to remain for 1 minute
      per caster level without concentration.</p>
