      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Precipitation of
      severity level 3 or higher, they gain fire resistance 10, plus 5 for each
      category above severity level 3. At severity level 7 they instead become
      immune to fire damage. They can also put out fires of Small or smaller
      size with a touch, increasing by one size category for each severity
      category above severity level 3, and their weapon attacks deal +2 damage
      to creatures with the fire subtype, +1 damage per category above severity
      level 3.</p>
