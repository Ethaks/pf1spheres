      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Project Thoughts (charm)),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>So long as you are personally familiar with the subject, you may spend
      an additional spell point to use your Project Thoughts charm across any
      distance, even across planes (although there is a 5% chance a cross-planar
      sending simply does not arrive). Recipients are allowed to respond in
      kind, but the target must voluntarily receive and send the messages; the
      target may simply decide to block you out, in which case the conversation
      immediately ends.</p>

      <p>You no longer require line of sight or line of effect when using the
      Project Thoughts charm when you are personally familiar with the
      target.</p>
