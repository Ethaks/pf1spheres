      "value": "<p>As a move action, you may cause a creature under the effects of your blood control and suffering from bleed damage to have their lost blood disperse into a mist, filling their space, granting them concealment (attacks made by the creature or targeting the creature have a 20% miss chance). This effect persists until you end it as a free action, the creature stops taking bleed damage, or your blood control ends. Your vision is not impaired by a mist you create.</p>\n<p>If you spend an additional spell point, the radius of the mist increases to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. The mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).</p>\n<p>A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the mist in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the mist in the explosive or fiery spell&#8217;s area. A wall of fire burns away the mist in the area into which it deals damage. If dispersed or burned away, the mist returns at the start of the creature&#8217;s next turn unless the bleed damage or blood control has ended.</p>\n<p>If you choose to take 1 Constitution damage when using this talent, you may treat all creatures within the mist as if they were below half their maximum hit points for the purpose of the save penalty on any instance of blood control targeting such a creature.</p>\n",
