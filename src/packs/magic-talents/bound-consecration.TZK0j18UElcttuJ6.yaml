      <p>When using a consecration, you may choose to have the area remain in
      place rather than move with you. Alternatively, you may apply a
      consecration to an object with a touch. The area of effect is centered on
      the object and moves with it (as normal, choose one corner of the
      object&#8217;s space to be the center of the consecration). You must make
      this choice when you first use the consecration.</p>
