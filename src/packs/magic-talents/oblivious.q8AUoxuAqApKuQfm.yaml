    value: >
      <p>When applying a glamer to a target, you may choose to do so subtly,
      such that they might not even realize they have been affected by one. If
      the target fails their saving throw against the glamer, they must attempt
      an additional Will saving throw. On a failure they do not realize they
      have been glamered. Glamers that damage or impede the target (for example,
      lighting someone on fire with a hostile glamer) cannot be done subtly in
      this fashion.</p>
