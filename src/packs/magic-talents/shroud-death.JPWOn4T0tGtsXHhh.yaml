    value: >
      <p>Whenever you succeed at an attack roll made as part of a ghost strike,
      you can choose to mark the affected creature with necrotic energy as a
      free action. If a marked creature dies within your dominion range within 1
      round per caster level, you can spend 1 spell point as an immediate action
      to reanimate its body. You can only have a number of creatures marked at a
      time equal to your casting ability modifier (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>If you possess Sustained Necromancy, you may use this talent to
      reanimate the body without spending a spell point if you concentrate on it
      with that talent.</p>
