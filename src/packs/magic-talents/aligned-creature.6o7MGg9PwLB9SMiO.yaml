      <p>Your companion is connected to great forces of alignment, such as
      angels, devils, or other extraplanars. Choose one end of the alignment
      spectrum your companion possesses (good, evil, lawful, chaotic). Your
      companion becomes connected to that alignment, and may smite a target of
      its opposed alignment once per day, as the paladin class feature. Your
      companion may smite its opposed alignment an additional time per day for
      every 7 Hit Dice possessed.</p>
