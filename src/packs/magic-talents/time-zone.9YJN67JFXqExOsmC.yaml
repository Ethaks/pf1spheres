      <p>When activating a (time) effect that targets an area, you may adjust
      the affected area to one of the following shapes:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Globe:</strong> Radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster
      levels centered on your square. This effect radiates from a central point,
      and cannot extend through walls. You may choose to exclude yourself from
      the effect.</li>

      <li><strong>Wall:</strong> You may arrange your alter time as up to three
      10-foot cubes, +1 cube per caster level. You must be able to perceive all
      areas your alter time will inhabit. You must occupy a space in or adjacent
      to one of the cubes.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If you possess the Ranged Time talent, the selected area may be
      anywhere with range and does not have to be centered on or adjacent to
      you, but the effect cannot extend beyond your Ranged Time range.</p>
