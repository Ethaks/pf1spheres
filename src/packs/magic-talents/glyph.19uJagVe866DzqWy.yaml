      <p>At the time of casting a ward you may choose to shape the ward into a
      glyph: a magical trap whose effects are not immediately active until
      triggered. A glyph is cast upon a 5-foot-by- 5-foot area and takes the
      form of a 6 inch tall symbol, faintly visible on a surface. The glyph
      lasts for 1 hour per caster level or until activated by a trigger
      specified by the caster at the time it is created. When activated, the
      glyph becomes the center point for the ward, and it performs its function
      for a number of rounds equal to your caster level, and then the ability
      ends.</p>

      <p>Once cast, the glyph cannot be moved from its location, unless its
      complete surface is movable (for example, if cast on the deck of a ship).
      Destroying the surface the glyph is on destroys it, but does not end the
      glyph effect once it has been triggered. If you have the Permanent Ward
      advanced talent, you may make a glyph that is permanent, and will activate
      with its trigger, stay active for as long as the trigger is active, and
      shut off afterwards until triggered again.</p>

      <p>Creating a glyph requires a round per caster level and a spell point.
      You must also pay the spell point cost of whatever ward the glyph will
      create, though you do not need to spend a spell point to maintain the
      ward: the glyph can maintain the ward as if it were concentrating. When
      you create the glyph, you may decide what area is covered by the
      glyph&#8217;s effect; this may be up to close range from the location of
      the glyph.</p>

      <p>You set all of the conditions of the glyph when it is created.</p>

      <p>Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded
      object without speaking a password (which you set when creating the glyph)
      triggers the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password
      trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as
      height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be
      set with respect to chaos, evil, good, or law, or to pass those of a
      particular religion.</p>

      <p>They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Glyphs
      respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who
      travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same
      area. However, if, for example, a cabinet has three different drawers,
      each can be separately warded.</p>

      <p>A glyph knows when it has been read, which may be used as part of a
      trigger. A glyph can only have one trigger, but you can always trigger
      your own glyph as a free action, provided you are still on the same plane
      of existence.</p>

      <p>A glyph can be seen by effects that detect or sense magic, and can also
      be detected as a magical trap can be. In order for someone to spot one of
      your glyphs it requires a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + 1/2
      your caster level (minimum 1). Disabling the glyph requires a Disable
      Device check with the same DC. Alternatively, destroying the surface the
      glyph is imprinted on can destroy the glyph, but once activated,
      destroying the glyph does not dispel the effect, and the glyph activates
      when damaged if the damage is not sufficient to destroy it.</p>
