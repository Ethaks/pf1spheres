      <p>You may add up to 10 feet from the radius of your normal and bright
      light, as well as the distance to which light is increased by one step, or
      subtract any distance from the radius of your light. If you possess
      talents that would alter the area of your light such as the Beam talent,
      this increased or decreased radius is added in before the area is
      multiplied. You may alter the area of your light as a free action, but for
      the purpose of (light) talents you may only affect one area per round.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, so long as you do not apply any (light) talents to your
      glow, you may increase the radius of your normal light to 40 feet and the
      radius of your bright light to 60 feet + 5 feet per caster level, and
      change the distance to which light is increased to the same amount.</p>

      <p>You may not alter the area of bright light shed by the Glory talent
      with Intensity Control.</p>
