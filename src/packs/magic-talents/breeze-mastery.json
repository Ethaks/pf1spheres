      "value": "<p>When using Breeze, you may spend a spell point to have it affect an area, granting its benefits to all creatures within a 15-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. Additionally, when you use Breeze, you may add any of the following additional effects depending on what other packages you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Air: Stable Winds:</strong> Requires air. You can create incredibly powerful winds, allowing you to walk upon the air with some difficulty as long as you concentrate. You can spend a spell point to allow yourself to walk on air as if walking on solid ground, with moving upward being similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, which is at a rate equal to half your normal land speed.</p>\n<p>Wind of severity level 3 or higher can blow you away regardless of your size, with any checks required (such as a Strength or Fly check) using your casting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier used for the check. You begin to fall as normal if you stop concentrating on this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth: Stabilizing Dustveil:</strong> Requires sand or loose dirt. You can create winds made up of fine particles of dust and sand, stabilizing the area around you. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to your CMD against bull rush, reposition, trip, and overrun combat maneuvers made against you. Additionally, you treat the first square of difficult terrain you enter every round as if it were normal terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire: Warm Breeze:</strong> Your breeze is heated to ward against the chill. Instead of the normal bonus to saves against very hot conditions or severe heat, Breeze instead grants this bonus to saves against very cold conditions and severe cold. Additionally, when used in this way, creatures affected by your Breeze treat the severity of all cold and precipitation weather effects as one step less severe, plus one per 10 caster levels you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal: Ferrous Zephyr:</strong> Requires metal. You can create a breeze filled with fine filaments of metal. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to your AC and to saving throws against electricity-based effects. Additionally, you ignore the penalties associated with the broken condition with any of your worn or wielded equipment (but is still considered broken regardless) as long as the Breeze is active.</p>\n<p><strong>Plant: Fragrant Flurry:</strong> Requires grass, vines, or weeds. Your breeze smells of pleasant meadows and flowers, and causes vines and flowers to grow where it touches. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze also applies to saving throws against the nauseated and sickened conditions and any harmful effects that rely on smell. Additionally, the DC required to track creatures affected by Breeze increases by an amount equal to the circumstance bonus granted by Breeze.</p>\n<p><strong>Water: Cooling Breeze:</strong> Requires rain, mist, or at least 5 cubic feet of water. Creatures affected by your Breeze treat the severity of all aridity and heat weather effects as one step less severe, plus one per 10 caster levels you possess.</p>\n",
