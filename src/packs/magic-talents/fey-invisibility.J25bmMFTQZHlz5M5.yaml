      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fallen Fey sphere (Fade
      (fey-blessing)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You must spend an additional spell point to use this fey blessing. You
      and all your equipment fade from view, becoming invisible. You gain total
      concealment, as well as a +40 bonus to Stealth checks when stationary,
      which decreases to +20 when moving.</p>

      <p>In addition, since you are invisible, you may attempt Stealth checks
      even while being observed and do not require cover to retain or initiate
      Stealth. Even when detected by another creature, an invisible creature
      gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls against sighted targets and ignores their
      Dexterity bonus to AC. Attacks against creatures with total concealment
      have a 50% chance they will simply miss, even if the attack has targeted
      the correct square. Making yourself invisible also hides any magical auras
      on yourself or your worn or held equipment from such effects as detect
      magic or the base Divination sphere divine ability.</p>

      <p>Making an attack, casting a spell or sphere ability with verbal or
      somatic components or subject to the Magical Signs drawback, speaking, or
      other loud or distracting actions ends this effect.</p>
