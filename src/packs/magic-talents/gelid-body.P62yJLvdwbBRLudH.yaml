      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Cold of severity
      level 3 or higher, they gain cold resistance 5 and DR 5/bludgeoning or
      magic, both increasing by 1 for each category above Cold severity level 3.
      At severity level 5 this damage resistance becomes DR/bludgeoning, and
      they gain vulnerability to sonic. At severity level 7, their damage
      resistance becomes DR/&#8211;.</p>
