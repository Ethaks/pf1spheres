      <p>When you cause a creature to glow, you may choose to grant all
      creatures a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls against that target, +1
      per 10 caster levels. When causing that creature to shed bright light, you
      may increase this bonus to +2, +1 per 5 caster levels. This has no effect
      on other creatures within the area of bright light.</p>
