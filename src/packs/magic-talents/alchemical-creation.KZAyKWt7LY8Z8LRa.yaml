      <p>You may create items that require processing, such as alchemical items
      and poisons. You may spend 1 spell point to create an alchemical item or
      poison worth up to 25 gp per caster level. This functions exactly as the
      normal alchemical item or poison, except that any DC is 10 + your casting
      ability modifier + 1/2 your caster level and any hit point damage it deals
      is increased by your casting ability modifier. These alchemical items or
      poisons remain for the normal duration of a created object, at which point
      they disappear as usual (but any effects inflicted on creatures or objects
      remain). You may also alter mundane alchemical items or poisons up to a
      maximum value of 25 gp per caster level, enhancing their potency in the
      same way for the normal duration, at which point the items return to their
      normal damage and saving throw DC. This does not stack with other effects
      that increase the item&#8217;s DC.</p>

      <p>At 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter, the total
      value you may alter or create increases by an additional 25 gp per caster
      level, according to Table: Alchemical Creation.</p>

      <p>If you possess Divided Creation, you may create any number of
      alchemical items or poisons whose total value is no more than half the
      maximum value you may create and whose total size is less than or equal to
      your maximum size (with each alchemical item or poison counting as a Small
      object), but only one object created this way increases its saving throw
      DC and damage. All others retain their base, non-magical statistics.</p>

      <p>If you possess Plasma Production, then any time you create an
      alchemical weapon that includes a fuse as the method of activating it
      (such as with a fuse grenade and its variants, or fireworks), you may
      create it with the fuse pre-lit. This allows you to treat the weapon as if
      you had used it as provided in its description. (For example, creating a
      fuse grenade with this option causes the grenade to explode in 1d4
      rounds.) You cannot create or alter poisons or formulae from the Alchemy
      sphere (see Spheres of Might), as those mixtures are simply too
      unstable.</p>
