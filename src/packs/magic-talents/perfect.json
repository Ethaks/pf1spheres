The target gains a +1 bonus to ability checks and skill checks based on that ability score. In addition, the target gains a benefit for the chosen ability score as detailed on the table below.</p>\n<p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend a spell point to allow the effect to endure for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.</p>\n<strong>Table: Perfect (word)</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Ability Score</th>\n<th>Bonus</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strength</td>\n<td>The target does not provoke attacks of opportunity when performing a bull rush, overrun, or trip maneuver. If the target can already perform one of these combat maneuvers without provoking an attack of opportunity, they instead gain a +2 bonus to combat maneuver checks to perform that maneuver. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 caster levels.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dexterity</td>\n<td>The target gains a +10 feet bonus to all movement speeds and whenever they move the first square is not considered threatened by any enemy. This bonus increases by +5 feet for every 5 caster levels.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Constitution</td>\n<td>The target gains 1 temporary hit point, plus 1 temporary hit point for every 5 caster levels. These temporary hit points refresh each round, but do not stack.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intelligence</td>\n<td>The target treats all untrained skills as though they had one skill rank in them, and gains a +2 bonus to all trained skills. This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wisdom</td>\n<td>The target can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check as a free action once per round and gains a +1 bonus to initiative checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charisma</td>\n<td>The target may use Intimidate to demoralize as a swift action (or a free action once per round if they can already do so as a swift action) and attempt to influence a creature&#8217;s attitude using Diplomacy in 1 round by taking a -10 penalty.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
