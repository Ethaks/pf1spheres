      "value": "<p>By spending a spell point when you alter or create an object, you may work with gaseous materials. You may create gases or change their composition into any other known substance with Change Material. A 5-foot cube equals a Medium creation. Half a cube equals a Small creature, but this decreases the DC of any created gaseous effect by 2 and halves any damage from harmful gases for any creature within that space. You must have line of sight to accomplish this, and as such cannot alter the air in a creature&#8217;s lungs or other, similar situations.</p>\n<p>As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to make more dangerous gases as detailed in the table below. Vacuums cannot be altered or created, and gases cannot be destroyed by damaging effects. Creatures standing in a square filled with unbreathable air must hold their breath or suffer the effects of suffocation, following the normal rules for doing so.</p>\n<p>A half-filled square of non-transparent gas obscures sight beyond 10 feet. Any creature behind more than 10 feet of squares half-filled with a gas has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). A square filled with a gas obscures sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment and creatures further away have total concealment (50% miss chance and attackers cannot use sight to locate the target). If a square is filled with a condensed gas (by treating a single square as a Large object) it obscures vision as above and is difficult to move in, halving movement speed of all creatures within it as well as imposing a -2 penalty to melee attack and damage rolls, preventing normal ranged attacks (siege weapons and magic attacks function normally), and treats anyone standing in a harmful gas as if they were exposed to it twice. (For example, taking double damage from acidic vapors, or two doses of poison from poisonous fumes.)</p>\n<p>A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses any altered or created gas in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gas in 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is not designed to be a perfect simulation of reality, and attempting to interject real-world physics and chemistry into it is often disastrous. As such, the gases that may be altered or created have been simplified from what their real world counterparts would be. If you wish to create a more specific gas, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with your GM - its effects should not exceed those of the gases normally available at your caster level.</p>\n<strong>Table: Gaseous Generation</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caster Level</th>\n<th>Gaseous Material</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>Breathable air</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>Unbreathable air, gaseous forms of non-harmful objects (for example, steam, smoke)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Non-magical inhaled poisons (using your sphere DC rather than the standard poison DC)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>Highly flammable gases (1d6 fire damage per ignited 5-foot cube of gas to all targets within a 20-foot radius of that ignited cube, Reflex half).</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
