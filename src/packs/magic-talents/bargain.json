      "value": "<p>You may spend a spell point as an immediate action when the target is subject to an attack or effect that deals hit point damage, after attack rolls and saving throws have been rolled but before the damage is determined. The attack or effect&#8217;s damage is delayed for the target for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Any additional effects of the attack or effect, such as poison, inflicting bleed damage, or a saving throw against the effect, are also delayed. When this word ends (or immediately if this word is dispelled), the target immediately takes the delayed damage and incurs any additional effects of the delayed attack or effect, subject to any changes to immunity, resistances, damage reduction, etc. A given attack or effect cannot be delayed more than once. Abilities contingent on taking damage, such as redirecting damage with the Protection sphere Community talent, are resolved as normal when the target takes the delayed damage.</p>\n<p>An unwilling creature cannot be targeted by this word. If a creature is subject to this word while already under the effects of a previous Bargain word, the previous Bargain word ends and the creature takes the delayed attack or effect&#8217;s damage immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Damage delayed by this word cannot be delayed further by the Guardian sphere&#8217;s delayed damage pool or any other effect which delays damage.</p>\n",
