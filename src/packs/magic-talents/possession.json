      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Project Spirit (advanced)), caster level 10th.</p>\n<p>When you project your spirit by use of the Project Spirit advanced Death talent, you may move into the same space as a material creature and attempt to possess it. You must spend a spell point to attempt a possession, and the target is allowed a Will save to negate. If their saving throw fails, the target&#8217;s soul is repressed, and yours assumes control of the body. You may only possess a physical creature with a soul (this includes most living creatures and intelligent undead but not constructs, unintelligent undead, or outsiders).</p>\n<p>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. You may only attempt to possess a creature once during any individual projection of your spirit.</p>\n<p>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, feats, talents, alignment, mental abilities, extraordinary abilities, supernatural abilities, and magical abilities such as spells and sphere abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You cannot choose to activate the body&#8217;s extraordinary or supernatural abilities.</p>\n<p>The creature&#8217;s spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body. You may possess a body for up to 1 hour per caster level, but may always end the effect early as a standard action. If the host body is slain, you return to your body and suffer 2 permanent negative levels. As is usual when projecting your spirit, this effect may be dispelled at either your body or the host&#8217;s body.</p>\n",
