      <p>You may spend a spell point to create an area of darkness as a swift
      action. This darkness is temporary, lasting only for one round before the
      effect ends. You cannot concentrate to maintain it, or spend a spell point
      to maintain it without concentration. Talents and abilities that would
      normally extend its duration (such as Lingering Darkness or Eternal
      Darkness) cannot be applied to areas of darkness created by this
      talent.</p>
