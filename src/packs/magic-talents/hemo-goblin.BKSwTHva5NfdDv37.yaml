    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to target a creature within blood control
      range that is taking bleed damage, under the effects of your blood
      control, or has less than half their hit points remaining. You summon a
      hemo goblin, an otherwise ordinary goblin (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary pg.
      156), into a square adjacent to the target. The hemo goblin gains a bonus
      to its armor class, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks equal to
      your caster level.</p>

      <p>The hemo goblin fights the target to the death, and will relentlessly
      pursue the target if they try to run. The goblin cannot be given commands
      nor can it be convinced to do anything but attack the target. This sphere
      effect lasts for 24 hours, until the hemo goblin is killed, or when the
      target dies, whichever comes first. A hemo goblin disappears when this
      sphere effect ends or when it dies. A hemo goblin does not leave a
      corpse.</p>

      <p>The hemo goblin has an unnatural sense of where the target is as though
      it were constantly locating the target&#8217;s general position as though
      using the Divination sphere Dowsing sphere effect and automatically
      succeeds at Survival checks to follow the target&#8217;s tracks. A hemo
      goblin does not automatically locate the target if they are hidden or
      difficult to find (such as invisibility or a safe house), or traveled a
      large distance in a short period of time (such as using the Warp sphere
      True Teleport advanced talent). If you possess the Mass Blood Magic
      talent, you may spend an additional spell point to summon a goblin for
      each additional valid target.</p>
