    value: >
      <p>If using telekinesis on a projectile or thrown object within your size
      limit (often as a readied action), you may stop the attack from dealing
      damage. The originator of the attack (the creature who threw the
      projectile, etc.) is allowed a Will save to negate this ability. After
      Catching an object, you may move it as normal for your telekinesis.</p>
