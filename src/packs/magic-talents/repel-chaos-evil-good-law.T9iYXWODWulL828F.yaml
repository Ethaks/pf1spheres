    value: >
      <p>You may create a ward that repels creatures of one end of the alignment
      spectrum (chaotic, evil, good, lawful), chosen by you when this ward is
      created. All creatures of that alignment cannot cross the edge of this
      ward unless they succeed at a Will save. Once a creature has succeeded at
      this Will save, they may cross the barrier without trouble and are immune
      to your Repel ward for 24 hours. If a creature is already within this
      warded area when it is created, or if the ward is moved into their space,
      they instantly become immune to the ward, as if they had succeeded at
      their saving throw. You cannot repel an alignment that you yourself
      possess.</p>
