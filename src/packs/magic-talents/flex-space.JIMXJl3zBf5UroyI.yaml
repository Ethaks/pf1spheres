    value: >
      <p>You can choose to either contract or expand space in an area equal to
      three 10-foot cubes, plus an additional 10-foot cube per caster level.
      These cubes must be arranged contiguously, but otherwise may assume any
      shape. Contracted space is easier to move through, allowing you to move 10
      feet per 5 feet of movement. Expanded space is more difficult to move
      through, and 10 feet of movement allows you to only move one 5-foot
      square. These effects multiply and divide all other movement costs (such
      as difficult terrain or poor visibility), and are a specific exception to
      the normal rule for doubling. This area lasts as long as you concentrate,
      but you may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per
      caster level without concentration. If you occupy squares with different
      effects on your movement speed, you move at the slowest rate of all the
      squares. If you attempt to contract an expanded space (or vice versa) you
      must succeed on a magical skill check against the opposing effect. On
      success, your effect functions normally and the opposing effect is
      suppressed for the duration.</p>
