      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Light sphere (Flicker (light)), caster
      level 7th.</p>

      <p>Your Flicker talent becomes more nuanced and refined. Rather than
      allowing someone to simply turn into a single body of light, you give them
      the ability to split themselves into multiple reflections. When a creature
      under the effects of your Flicker takes a move action, they may choose to
      move in two separate directions and end their move in two different
      locations. When they take their next action or the next time they are
      attacked or targeted at one of these locations, whichever is sooner, they
      must decide which of these positions they are actually in.</p>
