      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation, caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>You may spend 10 minutes to create enough bland food and drink to
      sustain a number of Medium-sized creatures equal to your casting ability
      modifier. If you possess Exquisite Detail you may create any normal
      assortment of food or drink using Profession (Cook) and gaining a bonus to
      this check equal to 1/2 your caster level. This is an instantaneous
      Creation effect that costs no spell points. Alternatively, you may use
      this ability as a standard action by spending 1 spell point.</p>

      <p>Additionally, by spending 1 spell point, you may create or alter any
      one object with normal size and material limitations to be edible. The
      object becomes nutritious enough to sustain a number of creatures based on
      its total size, with a Tiny-sized object being enough for a Medium
      creature. The object is treating as having a hardness of 0 against bite
      attacks, and creatures that do not have bite attacks can bite it to deal
      1d3 + 1/2 Strength modifier damage to the object. Objects in this way only
      retain this property for a limited period of time as normal for altering
      objects, but any part of the object that was devoured during this time is
      instantaneously converted into food. If you possess Permanent Change, you
      may make this an instantaneous effect by spending an additional spell
      point.</p>
