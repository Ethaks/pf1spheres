      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Read Omens
      (advanced, divine)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 3 spell points to divine for knowledge, delving the
      universe for the answer to a specific question. Delving in this manner is
      not an exact practice, and the only answers you may receive are
      &#8216;yes&#8217;, &#8216;no&#8217;, &#8216;unclear&#8217;, or
      &#8216;unknown&#8217;. You have a 50% chance + 1% per caster level of
      gaining a true answer. A failed roll produces an &#8216;unknown&#8217;
      answer, while a roll of 90% or higher produces a lie. If you use this
      ability to ask the same question twice, the same answer repeats.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> GMs are fully encouraged to use their own
      numbers and methods for determining when true, untrue, or unknown answers
      are gained. A caster divining knowledge could be asking friendly gods,
      bargaining with the Fates, reading the tablets of life, or using any
      number of alternate methods for gaining knowledge. As such, the specifics
      of this ability can vary widely between campaigns&#8212;friendly gods may
      always answer truthfully, while Fates may require specific bargains to be
      made in exchange for knowledge. It is always possible that the source of
      information being asked simply does not know the answers to certain
      questions.</p>
