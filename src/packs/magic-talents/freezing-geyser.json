      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((fire) and (water) package, Create Nature (geomancing), Temperature (fire, geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>\n<p>This creates a burst of boiling water that snap-freezes once it has covered its targets. As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to create an eruption coming from a 10- foot square of solid ground within range. This deals 1d6 fire damage per caster level per round to all creatures within the 10-foot square and up to 30 feet above it. A successful Reflex save halves the damage, but creatures with evasion still suffer 3d6 fire damage on a successful save.</p>\n<p>Starting in the second round of the geyser&#8217;s eruption, the rapidly cooling water begins raining down on all targets within 30 feet of the geyser, lasting for the length of the effect +1d3 rounds. Any creature caught in this freezing downpour takes 10d6 points of cold damage each round and is entangled by the layer of frost and ice forming on it. Even creatures affected by the main geyser who failed their Reflex save but left the area of cold rain find themselves entangled as the water on them freezes.</p>\n<p>A successful Reflex save halves the damage and prevents the entangled condition, but still deals 2d6 cold damage to creatures with evasion who successfully save. While a creature outside the affected area finds their entangled condition leaves after 1 round as the ice melts, creatures who remain within the affected area are affected each round, with each additional failed save causing its speed to be reduced by 10 feet. If the creature&#8217;s speed reaches 0 feet, it is completely encased in ice, as the (water) package geomancing ability, with ice thickness determined as usual for the caster. At this point the creature continues taking damage from the freezing water&#8212;automatically failing any saving throws&#8212;plus an additional 3d6 points of cold damage each round until freed from the ice.</p>\n<p>If an entangled creature steps into the burning geyser, they suffer fire damage as normal and are no longer entangled, as the boiling water melts the ice.</p>\n",
