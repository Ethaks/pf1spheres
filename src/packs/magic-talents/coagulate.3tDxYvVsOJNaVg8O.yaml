      <p>You may end any bleed damage affecting the target of your blood
      control. For the duration of the blood control, the target reduces any
      bleed damage taken by 1 + 1 per 3 caster levels and any creature using an
      effect that would inflict bleed damage must succeed at a magic skill check
      or have the bleed damage negated. Creatures imposing bleed damage via
      non-magical abilities (such as an attack that deals bleed damage) may
      substitute their base attack bonus for their magic skill bonus on this
      check.</p>

      <h3 id="toc3"><span>Blood Talent Types</span></h3>

      <p>Some Blood talents are marked (quicken) or (still). These talents grant
      you additional blood control abilities.</p>
