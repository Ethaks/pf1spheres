      <p>Your companion gains the ability to use webs to support itself and up
      to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, it can throw a
      web up to once per minute as a standard action. This is similar to an
      attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range
      increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size
      category larger than the companion. An entangled creature can escape with
      a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check.
      Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the
      companion&#8217;s Hit Dice + the companion&#8217;s Constitution modifier.
      Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it take a &#8211;4 penalty.</p>

      <p>The companion can create sheets of sticky webbing in adjacent squares
      up to three times its size (so a Medium companion can create a sheet that
      is 15-foot-by-15-foot.). Doing so requires a full-round action and counts
      as having used its web.</p>

      <p>Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to
      notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though
      by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a
      +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while
      pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section of web has a number of hit points
      equal to the Hit Dice of the companion that created it and DR
      5/&#8212;.</p>

      <p>If the companion possesses a climb speed, it can move across its own
      web at its climb speed. While touching a web it created, the companion can
      pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.</p>

      <p>If your companion is dismissed, any webs it created immediately
      disappear.</p>
