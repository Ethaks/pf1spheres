      <p>You may place charms on creatures. Charms require a standard action to
      use, have a range of close, and are subject to spell resistance. You may
      only use charms on targets that possess your own creature type (humanoid
      for humanoids, etc.) although the Expanded Charm talent changes this. Each
      charm has three strengths; lesser, greater, and powerful. Lesser charms
      are at-will abilities, but you may not target an individual creature more
      than once in a day with any individual lesser charm. Greater charms cost a
      spell point to use and powerful charms cost 2 points to use. You must
      possess the Powerful Charm talent before you may use any powerful
      charms.</p>

      <p>When you gain the Mind sphere, you gain the following charm:</p>
