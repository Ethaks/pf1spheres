    value: >
      <p>When a creature within range succeeds on a saving throw, skill check,
      or ability check, or hits with an attack, you may spend a spell point as
      an immediate action to force them to reroll the saving throw, skill check,
      ability check, or attack roll. However, starting after the reroll, they
      gain a +4 bonus to that category of roll until they succeed on another
      such saving throw or check or, if they reroll an attack roll, until they
      hit with another attack. Succeeding on the rerolled saving throw or check
      or hitting with the rerolled attack does not end this effect.</p>
