      <p>You shapeshift into an animal whose size is Diminutive or Tiny.
      Attacking, using a supernatural ability that requires activation, or
      casting a spell, spell-like ability, or sphere effect immediately ends
      this fey-blessing. You gain the movement modes of the chosen creature as
      well as any of the following abilities it possesses: darkvision 60 feet,
      low-light vision, and scent. The chosen animal may only have climb and
      land speeds; at 5th caster level, it may have a burrow speed, and at 7th
      caster level it may have a fly speed. Your statistics change as described
      in the Size Change talent of the Alteration sphere. This is a polymorph
      effect.</p>
