      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a bright light that binds the
      glowing target inside a prison of light. The target is entangled and must
      succeed at a Fortitude save each round or also be staggered for that
      round. In addition, the target must succeed at a magic skill check to use
      any form of dimensional travel, such as the dimension door spell or the
      teleport ability from the Warp sphere.</p>
