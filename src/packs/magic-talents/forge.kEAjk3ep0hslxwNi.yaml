      <p>You may spend a spell point to shape material. This is an instantaneous
      effect, as you are literally changing the shape of the material in
      question (i.e., it has no duration, and cannot be dispelled once
      finished). You can only affect materials you can create (i.e., you must
      possess the Expanded Materials talent to work with materials other than
      vegetable matter), and you may only make crude changes such as forming
      walls, trenches, doors, coffers and other basic shapes. Detailed work
      (such as forging armor) is not possible, and there is a 30% chance that
      anything with moving parts simply does not work. You may affect targets up
      to your normal creation size, but when working with a mineral (stone,
      metals, gems, etc.) the size you may affect is reduced by half.</p>
