      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((fire) package), Weather
      sphere (Wind Lord (advanced)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When you are using control weather to create or alter Wind of severity
      level 7 you may cause the tornadoes to become alive with fire. Any object
      or creature swept into the funnel cloud takes an additional 6d6 fire
      damage each round and are set on fire once they are expelled. Any
      flammable objects (including grass or other vegetation) in the
      tornadoes&#8217; path that cannot be swept into the funnel cloud take 6d6
      fire damage and are set on fire.</p>
