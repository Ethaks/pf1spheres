      <p>You learn to manipulate the magic of a sphere effect that is currently
      affecting you. You may grant any amount of creatures the effects of any
      harmless sphere effect with a non-instantaneous duration currently active
      on you, ending the effect on yourself and dividing the duration of the
      effect across the creatures you touch (including yourself).</p>

      <p>The duration must be divided in the same increments the original
      ability&#8217;s duration is granted in (for example, an aegis must be
      divided in 1 hour increments). You may also use this ability to transfer
      non-harmless effects on creatures, but you must spend a spell point and
      succeed at a magic skill check on the effect, and your target gets a Will
      save to resist this if they are unwilling. This talent cannot be used on
      curse effects.</p>
