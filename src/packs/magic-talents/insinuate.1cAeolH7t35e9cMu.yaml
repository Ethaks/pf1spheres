    value: >
      <p>You are skilled at slipping your magic into the natural surroundings,
      subtly manipulating natural murk and shadows to fit your purpose. You may
      overlap an area of blot with the natural shadows in an area in such a way
      that it is indistinguishable without magically augmented senses. This
      ability functions in any lighting condition so long as there are shadows
      present, and does not change the prevailing lighting condition. This area
      of blot may be imbued with a Dark sphere talent as normal, though talents
      with obvious or harmful effects will immediately reveal the ruse. If the
      lighting in an area is such as to eliminate the casting of any shadows,
      then Insinuate cannot be used. Otherwise, a blot created using this talent
      covers its normal area of effect.</p>
