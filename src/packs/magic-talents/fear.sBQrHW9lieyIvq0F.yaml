    value: >
      <p>You may warp a target&#8217;s mind with fear.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You cause the target to become shaken
      for 1 round per caster level (Will negates).</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> You cause a target to become frightened
      for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). On a successful save, they
      are still shaken for 1 round per caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This is the same as the greater charm,
      except the target becomes panicked instead of frightened. On a successful
      save, they are still shaken for 1 round per caster level.</p>
