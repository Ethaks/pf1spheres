      <p>You may create glamers that subtly change the way someone is perceived,
      aiding in their social interactions. Choose two of the following skills:
      Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform. You may take this talent a
      second time to be able to choose all four skills.</p>

      <p>As a trick, you may aid another on any target within your illusion
      range with the selected skills.</p>

      <p>As a glamer, you may grant an enhancement bonus to skill checks with
      the selected skills equal to half your caster level.</p>
