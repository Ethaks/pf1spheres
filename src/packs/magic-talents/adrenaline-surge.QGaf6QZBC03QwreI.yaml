    value: >
      <p>When you use a Life sphere talent or ability on an ally other than
      yourself, you may spend one spell point to also give them an adrenaline
      surge. The ally may do one of the following as an immediate action:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Make an attack at their highest base attack bonus</li>

      <li>Move their speed, provoking attacks of opportunity normally</li>

      <li>Make an Escape Artist check with a bonus equal to your caster
      level</li>

      <li>Draw, pick up, or ready a weapon or shield</li>

      <li>Stand up from prone</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You may use this ability to surge multiple allies (other than yourself)
      at a time when you perform a Life sphere ability that affects multiple
      allies by spending a second spell point. Surges are resolved in initiative
      order.</p>
