      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere, caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may touch a target and spend 3 spell points to place it into a
      state of suspended animation (Fortitude negates). For the creature, time
      ceases to flow and its condition becomes fixed. The creature does not grow
      older. Its body functions virtually cease, and no force or effect can harm
      it. When placing this effect on a creature, you may choose to either place
      the target into stasis permanently or to set either a time limit or a
      condition on the ability. When the time limit expires or the condition is
      met, the temporal stasis ends. Temporal Stasis may be dispelled.</p>
