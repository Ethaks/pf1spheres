      <p>You may grant a motif that ensures a glorious dawn after the darkest
      night. Whenever the target is below 50% of their maximum hit points, they
      roll twice on all saving throws and take the better result.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect when they are below 50% of their
      maximum hit points and succeed on a saving throw against a non-harmless
      effect to regain a number of hit points equal to the caster level + your
      casting ability modifier and gain an insight bonus to armor class and
      saving throws equal to your casting ability modifier for 1 round.</p>
