      <p>By increasing the casting time of your glow by one step or by spending
      a spell point you may apply two (nimbus) talents to a single glow effect,
      causing it to shed light in the area defined in both (nimbus) talents.
      Alternatively, you may choose to apply a single (nimbus) talent while also
      shedding light in the normal radius of your glow, or apply a single
      (nimbus) talent twice. Creatures in overlapping areas are still only
      affected by (light) talents and other effects of your glow once.</p>
