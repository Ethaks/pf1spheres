      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere (Lingering
      Transformation), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When applying a shapeshift, you may spend 2 spell points to change your
      shapeshift into an instantaneous effect, permanently changing the creature
      into the new form. Because this is an instantaneous effect, it cannot be
      dispelled once placed. The target is still under the effect of a
      shapeshift, however, and any caster attempting to apply a new shapeshift
      to the target (except the original caster himself) must succeed at a magic
      skill check as usual; the second shapeshift replaces the first instead of
      adding to it. When the second shapeshift&#8217;s duration expires, the
      first shapeshift returns. A second application of a Permanent
      Transformation can be used to counter the first Permanent Transformation,
      returning the target to its original form. The Make Whole advanced Life
      talent, as well as polymorph any object, can also restore the target to
      its original form.</p>
