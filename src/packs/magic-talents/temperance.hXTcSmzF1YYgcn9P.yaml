    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that protects against the whims of luck. When the
      target rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw or attack roll, they may reroll
      it. If the new roll is also a natural 1, this effect does not allow them
      to reroll again, though the motif &#8217;s discharge effect may allow them
      to.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect to reroll a single saving throw
      they have just made but before the results of that roll are revealed. They
      must take the result of the reroll, even if it is worse than the original
      roll.</p>
