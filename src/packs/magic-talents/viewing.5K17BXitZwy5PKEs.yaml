    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to divine, transferring your point of view
      to any point within range. You may see and hear from this location. This
      method of using divine is not blocked by wood or stone, but is still
      blocked by lead. However, the locale must be known&#8212;a place familiar
      to you, or an obvious one such as a distance and direction. Once you have
      selected the locale, the sensor does not move, but you can rotate it in
      all directions to view the area as desired, in all ways as if you were
      standing where your sensor is located. This ability creates a scrying
      sensor, which can be detected (Perception DC 20 + caster level) and
      dispelled.</p>
