    value: >
      <p>You may spend an additional spell point when making a teleport to no
      longer require line of sight to the destination; instead of choosing a
      spot to appear, you may instead indicate a direction and distance.</p>

      <p>If the target arrives in a place that is already occupied by a solid
      body, you may spend a spell point to return the target to its point of
      origin unharmed. Otherwise, the target takes 1d6 points of damage and is
      shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of
      the intended location. If there is no free space within 100 feet, the
      target takes an additional 2d6 points of damage and is shunted to a free
      space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, the
      target takes an additional 4d6 points of damage and the teleport simply
      fails.</p>
