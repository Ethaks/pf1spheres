    value: >
      <p>As a special application of restore, you may cause a creature damaged
      by positive energy to suffer 1d2 temporary negative levels for one hour
      per caster level (with no save instead of the usual Will save to negate),
      even if they are normally immune to negative levels. When used this way,
      this application of restore requires a touch attack or ranged touch
      attack, and is considered a ray.</p>

      <p>The inflicted negative levels increase by 1 die size per 5 caster
      levels (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). These levels stack, but do not destroy
      an undead creature if they have as many negative levels as Hit Dice.
      Instead, if a negative level would reduce the creature to 0 Hit Dice, the
      creature instead takes 4 points of Constitution drain (even if they are
      normally immune to ability drain) or Charisma drain if they have no
      Constitution score for the duration of the effect. A negative energy
      effect that causes negative levels can be used to remove these negative
      levels before they become permanent. If a negative level lasts longer than
      1 day, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save per negative level or
      have the negative level become permanent.</p>
