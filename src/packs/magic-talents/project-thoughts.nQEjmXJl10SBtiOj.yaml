      <p>You can communicate directly into the mind of another.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You may project a telepathic message to
      a target consisting of no more than 25 words. If you and the target do not
      possess a shared language, this form of communication is impossible.
      Unlike other lesser charms, there is no limit to the number of times you
      may use this on a target in a day.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> Your projected telepathic message does
      not have a word limit, although communication is carried out in real time
      and you must concentrate for as long as you communicate. You can
      communicate with the target even without a shared language.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This functions the same as the greater
      charm, except the target may also respond to you with their own projected
      telepathic messages, allowing for two-way communication. However, the
      target is under no obligation to respond in any way and can simply remain
      silent if they so choose.</p>
