    value: >
      <p>You may allow a target to surrender themselves to fate. The target
      takes a -3 penalty to all saving throws, but rolls each saving throw twice
      and chooses the better roll. This penalty decreases by 1 for every 10
      caster levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect to roll a saving throw three times
      and choose the best roll (with the same penalty). The target may also end
      this motif as a free action with no further effect.</p>
