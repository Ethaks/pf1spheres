    value: >
      <p>As an expunge, you may force the target to attempt a Fortitude save. If
      they fail their save, their internal spell point reservoir becomes
      dangerous to tap into. Every time the target expends one or more spell
      points, they take 1d8 nonlethal damage for every spell point they use, up
      to a maximum amount of dice equal to your caster level (though this does
      not cause the caster to attempt concentration checks). At caster level
      3rd, the damage dealt per spell point increases to 2d8, and by an
      additional 1d8 damage every three caster levels thereafter.</p>

      <p>The target may voluntarily release a number of spell points equal to
      your casting ability modifier as a standard action (which does not damage
      them) in order to end this effect, otherwise it lasts for 1 minute per
      caster level.</p>
