      <p>A white cat and black cat both watched on, as the tall ones quibbled.
      They laughed, and played, and so the tall ones experienced both fortune
      and misfortune with a wave of their paws.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You gain the following Fate sphere abilities which manipulate luck and
      rolled dice:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Felicity (consecration):</strong> While this consecration is
      in effect, the success and failure of all creatures in the area is
      manipulated. When you create this consecration, choose &#8220;weal&#8221;
      or &#8220;woe&#8221;. If you chose &#8220;weal&#8221;, all creatures treat
      a naturally rolled 19 on a d20 as though it were a natural 20. If you
      chose &#8220;woe&#8221;, all creatures treat a naturally rolled 2 on a d20
      as though it were a natural 1. This consecration&#8217;s &#8220;woe&#8221;
      effect is considered a curse effect. For every 10 caster levels you
      possess, the range which weal and woe manipulate naturally rolls as 20 and
      1 respectively increases by +1 (e.g. caster level 10 weal would treat a
      naturally rolled 18-20 as a natural 20). You must concentrate to maintain
      this consecration. You may always spend an additional spell point as a
      free action to allow this consecration to continue for 1 minute per caster
      level without concentration.</li>

      <li><strong>Boon (word):</strong> After a creature within range makes a
      d20 roll, as an immediate action, you may grant the target a +1 luck bonus
      to that roll. If you spend 1 additional spell point, this bonus increases
      to +2 + 1 per 10 caster levels. You may use this word after the results of
      the d20 roll are revealed, which may change the results of the d20 roll
      into a success.</li>

      <li><strong>Jinx (word) [curse]:</strong> After a creature within range
      makes a d20 roll, as an immediate action, you may cause the target to
      suffer a -1 penalty to that roll. If you spend 1 additional spell point,
      this penalty increases to -2 - 1 per 10 caster levels. You may use this
      word after the results of the target&#8217;s d20 roll are revealed, which
      may change the results of the d20 roll into a failure. An unwilling target
      may attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> A d20 roll modified by the Felicity
      (consecration) cannot be modified by other effects (such as the Tug Fate
      (consecration)) but can be rerolled.</p>
