    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you may command terrain and natural effects to
      act on your behalf. The effect produced depends on the environmental
      aspect targeted. Each effect must be centered or targeted within close
      range. Because geomancing manipulates natural elements, it is not subject
      to spell resistance, even if a geomancing ability targets a creature
      directly.</p>

      <p>Geomancing effects come in two forms: instantaneous and concentration.
      Instantaneous effects have no duration, while concentration effects
      persist as long as the caster concentrates or they may spend a spell point
      as a free action to allow the effect to continue for 1 round per caster
      level without the need for concentration.</p>

      <p>When a caster gains the Nature sphere, he chooses and gains one of the
      following Nature packages, with its included abilities. A caster may gain
      the Expanded Geomancing talent to gain additional packages.</p>
