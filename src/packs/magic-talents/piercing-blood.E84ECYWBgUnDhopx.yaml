      <p>As a standard action, you briefly impale the target on a solidified
      column, such as a spear or cross, made from their own blood. On a failed
      Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss, takes 1d6 piercing damage
      per 2 caster levels you possess (minimum 1d6), and is staggered for 1
      round.</p>

      <p>Instead of targeting a creature, you may suffer blood loss as a
      standard action to launch a projectile made of blood, such as a spear or
      whirling scythe. Make a ranged touch attack against the target with a
      circumstance bonus on your attack roll equal to the blood loss. On a
      successful hit, the target suffers blood loss and 1d6 piercing damage per
      2 caster levels you possess (minimum 1d6) and must succeed on a Fortitude
      save or be staggered for 1 round.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point when casting this blood art
      either to target a creature or to launch a projectile, creatures staggered
      by this effect are instead staggered for a number of rounds equal to your
      casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p>If you possess Mass Blood Magic, when casting this effect to launch a
      projectile, you may spend an additional spell point to pierce multiple
      foes. Choose a number of additional targets no greater than 1/2 your
      caster level (minimum 1). Make a ranged touch attack against the initial
      target then each additional target in order. No target can be farther than
      10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels from the previous target and no
      target can be targeted more than once. Should any of the targets fail to
      take damage, either by a missed attack, resistances, or other method, the
      projectile stops and no further targets are damaged.</p>
