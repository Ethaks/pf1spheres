      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Enthrall (charm), Powerful
      Charm, Project Thoughts (charm)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When you place a powerful Enthrall charm on a target, you may spend an
      additional spell point to increase the duration to 1 day per caster level.
      In addition, the target obeys all commands you give it, except for
      obviously suicidal ones. Commands that are against the target&#8217;s
      nature grant it a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to throw off the entire
      effect.</p>

      <p>You may communicate your requests telepathically to the target (if you
      do not have a shared language, you can only communicate basic commands
      such as &#8216;go&#8217;, &#8216;fight&#8217;, &#8216;stand still&#8217;,
      etc.). This can be done over any distance once established, but not across
      planes.</p>

      <p>By concentrating fully on the effect (a standard action), you can
      receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, and
      if you possess the Read Mind talent and Greater Communication advanced
      talent, it can communicate with you. You cannot actually see through the
      subject&#8217;s eyes, but it still gives you a general idea of
      what&#8217;s going on.</p>

      <p>If you do not spend at least 1 round concentrating on the creature each
      day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off your
      control.</p>
