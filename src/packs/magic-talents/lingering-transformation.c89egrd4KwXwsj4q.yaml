      <p>Your shapeshift effects linger for 2 additional rounds after you stop
      concentrating. Additionally, when you spend a spell point to continue your
      shapeshift without concentration, the duration increases to 10 minutes per
      caster level. If your duration is already or becomes 10 minutes per caster
      level in certain situations due to another source, it instead increases to
      1 hour per caster level when in those certain situations.</p>
