      <p>You may grant a motif that subtly improves the target&#8217;s ability
      to make their own fate. The target gains a floating pool of bonus points
      they can use throughout the duration of this motif. This pool has 1 point,
      plus 1 point per caster level when you first grant the motif. The target
      may spend up to 1 point for every 5 caster levels (minimum 1) to gain an
      insight bonus to an attack roll, weapon damage roll, skill check, ability
      check, or saving throw equal to the points they spend. The effect does not
      end if they spend all of these points, but they can no longer spend
      them.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect to gain an insight bonus equal to
      +5 plus +1 for every 4 remaining points to any one attack roll, skill
      check, ability check, or saving throw.</p>
