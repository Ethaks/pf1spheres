      "value": "<p>Choose a number of extraordinary or supernatural abilities dependent on your target&#8217;s base form (darkvision, scent, racial breath weapon, etc.). You may choose to allow the target to retain these abilities in place of trait you would normally grant them as part of your shapeshift, at a cost of one trait per ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Catmera Form: [Catgirl HB addendum]</strong> You may spend 1 additional spell point as part of granting a shapeshift to one or more targets, causing the resulting shapeshift effect to blend with the target&#8217;s natural form. The resulting shapeshift causes the target to assume a hybrid form, gaining all limbs, natural attacks, special abilities, and movement moves of the shapeshift without changing the target&#8217;s base form or melding any of their equipment. The target may choose to retain limbs and movement speeds from their base form if the shapeshift lacks them or has lesser versions and may choose to forgo any additional limbs or heads when receiving this shapeshift and are able to effectively choose their body make-up resulting from this shapeshift. A shapeshift effect granted this way does not cause the target&#8217;s equipment to meld with this hybrid form.</p>\n<p>If the shapeshift would grant the target additional legs, the target may instead gain them as arms, although they are treated as arms gained with the Additional Limbs &#8220;two secondary arms&#8221; trait.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> This talent is similar to the Hybrid Transformation feat, allowing a shapeshifted target to pick and choose their resulting form&#8217;s qualities. A humanoid being subject to a shapeshift modified by this talent could choose to keep their arms when assuming a hybrid form based on Serpentine Transformation or add legs to Aquan Transformation. A winged creature could retain their wings under an Animalistic Transformation.</p>\n",
