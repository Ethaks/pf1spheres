      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere (Lingering Illusion,
      Programmed Illusion), caster level 8th.</p>

      <p>By spending an additional spell point, you no longer need to have line
      of sight or spend a standard action to direct, move, or alter your
      figments. This allows your figments to somewhat automatically adapt to
      situations without having to be given new orders or modifying appearances
      to fit the situation.</p>

      <p>Your illusions, when behaving autonomously, act and react more or less
      realistically depending upon your caster level. Use the following table as
      a guideline for what may at most be expected from an illusion acting
      independently.</p>

      <p>Phantom Mind illusions resist casual testing, as they know when they
      should respond and how, and can outsmart less intelligent creatures
      without direction from you. Creatures with an Intelligence score lower
      than half the caster level of the illusion gain no benefits from obvious
      signs of trickery and cannot outsmart them with causal testing.</p>
