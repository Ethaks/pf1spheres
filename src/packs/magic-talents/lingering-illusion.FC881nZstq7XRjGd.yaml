    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to allow the illusion to remain for 1
      minute per caster level without the need for concentration. When a figment
      is not maintained through concentration, it performs whatever set of
      actions it was last commanded to do, and cannot move beyond medium range
      of where it was placed. Giving a figment a new series of programmed
      activities is a move action.</p>
