    value: >
      <p>When causing a glow effect to shed normal or bright light, as a free
      action you may cause it to trail light behind it rather than radiate light
      normally. The glow sheds normal or bright light in any square it passes
      through during the round, and the light 20 feet away from any square of
      this area (or 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels away if shedding bright
      light) is increased by one step to a maximum of normal. If you return the
      light&#8217;s area to normal or change between (nimbus) talents, any trail
      left behind is removed.</p>
