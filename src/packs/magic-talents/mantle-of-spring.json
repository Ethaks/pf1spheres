      "value": "<p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>\n<p><strong>Plant Growth:</strong> A single plant or creature of the plant type that you touch increases its size by one category. This increases by one category per 10 caster levels. This effect persists for as long as you are within 30 feet of the target, until you end it as a free action, you choose to apply it to a different target, or the fey-link ends. Unwilling creatures are permitted a Will save to negate this effect. This effect bypasses the immunity to polymorph effects of the plant type. For creatures of the plant type, see the Size Change talent in the Alteration sphere to see the effects of growing to their new size.</p>\n<p>This ability cannot cause creatures to grow larger than Huge. At 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter, this limit increases by one size category, to a maximum of Colossal at 15th caster level. This is a polymorph effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdant Step:</strong> You may cause flowers, grass, and small vines to spring up wherever you step. The rapid, clinging growth creates difficult terrain in any space you enter until the start of your next turn. You are not hindered by this difficult terrain. This effect may be halted or resumed as a free action. If you spend a spell point as a free action, this growth instead remains for 1 minute per caster level. This ability does not function if you are not touching the ground.</p>\n<p>This growth is considered sufficient to be a target by any abilities of the (plant) package of the Nature sphere that requires plants (but not large growths such as trees) until the start of your next turn or for 1 minute per caster level when using the spell point option. After this time expires, the growth fades away and any ongoing effects requiring it end.</p>\n",
