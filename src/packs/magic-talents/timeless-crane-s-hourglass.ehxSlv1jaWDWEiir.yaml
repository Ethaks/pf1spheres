      <p>You channel the timelessness of the jian crane into a whirling
      prismatic globe of possibilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Time sphere.</p>

      <p>You create a sphere with a radius up to 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster
      levels. This effect remains centered around you as you move. You may spend
      1 spell point to allow this effect to continue for 1 round per caster
      level without concentration.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Ranged Time talent, you may choose to center this
      effect on a square within your Time sphere range, and if you do, can
      include yourself when choosing flow or tumble.</p>

      <p>When you first cast this effect and at the start of your turn each
      round, choose flow or tumble:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Flow:</strong> You may allow any number of creatures
      (excluding yourself) inside this effect&#8217;s radius to take a 5-foot
      step, provided they do not move outside this effect&#8217;s radius. This
      movement does not count against a creature&#8217;s ability to take a
      5-foot step during their turn. At caster level 10th, creatures granted a
      5-foot step by this effect may move up to 10 feet instead.</li>

      <li><strong>Tumble (requires Warp sphere):</strong> You may teleport 1
      creature + 1 creature per 10 caster levels (excluding yourself) inside
      this effect&#8217;s radius to another unoccupied, open area inside the
      effect&#8217;s radius (Will negates). If you possess the Warp sphere
      Unwilling Teleport talent, you can attempt to shift creatures into
      locations that would be directly harmful to that creature as though using
      the Unwilling Teleport talent, but those creatures gain a +4 bonus on
      their saving throw to resist being teleported. You must spend 1 additional
      spell point when choosing this option each round.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>This is a teleportation effect.</p>
