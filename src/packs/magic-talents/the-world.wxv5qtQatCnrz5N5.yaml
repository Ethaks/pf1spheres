    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that enhances the target&#8217;s ability to
      succeed in all their endeavors whenever they commit their efforts.
      Whenever they take 10 or take 20 on a skill check, they gain a +2 insight
      bonus to the result. This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect to take 15 (as if they were taking
      20) on any skill check without spending additional time, so long as they
      could normally take 20 with that skill and are trained in it. At 10th
      caster level, when the target discharges the effect they may take 15 on a
      skill check without spending additional time even if they are not trained
      in the skill. At 20th caster level, when the target discharges the effect
      they attempt the check as though they had ranks in the skill equal to
      their Hit Dice (to a maximum of your caster level). The insight bonus from
      this motif applies to this skill check.</p>
