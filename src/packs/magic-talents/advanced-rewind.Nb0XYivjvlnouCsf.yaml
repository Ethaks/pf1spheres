      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere (Age (time)), caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>You may use the Age (time) talent to not only alter the age of
      creatures or objects, but also enchantments. By spending two spell points
      and succeeding at a magic skill check against the enchantment&#8217;s
      magic skill defence, you may rewind an enchantment on a creature or object
      to before it was placed, removing it from the target. This cannot be used
      to reverse instantaneous effects such as damage, but can be used to remove
      permanent enchantments. If successfully used on a magic item this renders
      the object non-magical. This has no effect on artifacts, but can be used
      to target area spells. Permanent constructs are treated as creatures for
      this effect; you can rewind an enchantment off of a construct, but cannot
      rewind the enchantment that gave life to the construct itself.</p>
