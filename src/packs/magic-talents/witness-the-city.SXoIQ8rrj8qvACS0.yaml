    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to see, hear, smell, feel, and even taste a
      torrent of past scenes and pieces of conversations related to anything in
      a settlement you are currently in. At the end of each of your turns for
      the duration of this divination, attempt a single Diplomacy check to
      gather information as though you had spent 1d4 hours talking to local
      people, without having to use an action to do so. Multiple Diplomacy
      checks made to gather information on the same topic always grants the same
      information as the first check. You can use your Perception bonus in place
      of your Diplomacy bonus if you so wish, but with a -5 penalty.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Settlements range in population size from fewer
      than 20 (thorp) to greater than 25,000 (metropolis). In order to maintain
      the balance of this talent, it is suggested that when working with
      particularly large settlements that GMs restrict the use of the talent to
      districts of the settlement.</p>
