      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Viewing (divine)),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 1 spell point to cast one magic sphere effect through
      your viewing viewpoint, using it as your location for the purpose of
      determining line of sight, line of effect, and range. If an ability
      requires a successful melee or ranged touch attack, use your normal
      bonuses for these attacks. You must pay for the spell point cost of the
      magic sphere effect as normal. Casting a magic sphere effect in this way
      immediately ends the viewing or scrying effect you are using.</p>
