      <p>You gain several abilities which improve your capacity to operate
      underwater.</p>

      <p><strong>Adjust Buoyancy (spirit):</strong> You may spend 1 spell point
      to change your buoyancy to swiftly rising, neutral, or swiftly sinking for
      10 minutes per level (see the aquatic rules section of Pathfinder Campaign
      Setting: Aquatic Adventures for rules on buoyancy). Your buoyancy does not
      change based on what equipment you are carrying. As a standard action, you
      may change your buoyancy again (alongside the buoyancy of any other
      willing creatures affected by this spirit).</p>

      <p><strong>Aquatic Mire (geomancing):</strong> You may create fog effects
      underwater, in which case they function as they normally would in the air.
      Instead of wind, currents can disperse an underwater fog; any current with
      a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a fog in 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Create Current (geomancing):</strong> If you have the (air)
      package, you may use the gust of wind ability underwater, creating a
      current of equal speed and range to the gust of wind you could create (see
      the aquatic rules section of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic
      Adventures for rules on currents).</p>

      <p><strong>Deep Adaptation (spirit):</strong> You adapt incredibly quickly
      to changes in pressure, taking no damage from pressure effects. In
      addition, you can move and attack underwater normally without the usual
      penalties involved with underwater combat, as if under the effects of
      freedom of movement (this does not grant you the other benefits of the
      spell). This benefit lasts for as long as you concentrate or 10 minutes
      per caster level if you spend 1 spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Echoes of the Sea (spirit):</strong> You may spend 1 spell
      point to gain the ability to track creatures through the water as if
      across soft ground as long as they passed through the area less than 1
      week ago (this lets you notice trails that are much older than normal
      underwater trails). You retain this benefit for 1 hour per caster
      level.</p>
