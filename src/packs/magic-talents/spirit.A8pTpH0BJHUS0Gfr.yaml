      <p>Some talents are marked (spirit). These talents give the caster ways
      they have learned to tune their spirit with nature.</p>

      <p>Each (spirit) talent grants the caster a new ability they may use as a
      standard action unless otherwise specified. If a (spirit) talent grants
      multiple options, each one is considered a separate spirit ability. If an
      ability granted by a (spirit) talent affects a target directly, that
      effect is subject to spell resistance.</p>

      <p>If a (spirit) talent uses your geomancing range or references a
      geomancing ability, you may instead use your caster level with (spirit)
      talents to determine the range or strength of its effects.</p>
