    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to gain a sense that reduces the
      distance-based DC adjustment for Perception checks by an amount equal to
      your caster level. (For example, if the DC would normally increase by 10
      due to being 100 feet away and you have caster level of 3, the DC increase
      would only be by 7.) While this sense is active, you also reduce
      environmental and range increment-based penalties to your ranged attack
      rolls by an amount equal to half your caster level. This can only ever
      reduce penalties, and can never grant a bonus.</p>
