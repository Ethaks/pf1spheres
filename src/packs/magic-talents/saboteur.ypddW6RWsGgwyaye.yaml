      <p>You become adept at disassembling machinery, reducing even complex
      devices to trash with shocking speed. You gain a competence bonus on
      Disable Device checks equal to half your caster level (minimum 1) and
      treat all devices as being one category simpler for the purposes of
      determining how long it takes to use Disable Device. Thus, difficult
      devices count as tricky, tricky devices count as simple, and simple
      devices can be dismantled as a free action. Additionally, once per round,
      you may deal bonus damage equal to your caster level on any roll to damage
      unattended objects.</p>
