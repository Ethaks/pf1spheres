    value: >
      <p>When you use a ghost strike, instead of unleashing an attack yourself,
      you may have an undead you control within range deliver the attack as a
      melee touch attack sometime within the next round. This charge is
      &#8216;held&#8217; through the round; if the undead gets multiple attacks,
      it can attempt to deliver the touch attack additional times if the first
      attempt failed. If you spend an additional spell point, you may grant a
      use of this ghost strike to each undead you control, but multiple undead
      cannot affect the same target with the same ghost strike that round.</p>
