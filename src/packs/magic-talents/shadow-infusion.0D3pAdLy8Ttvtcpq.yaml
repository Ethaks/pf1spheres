      <p>When using an Illusion sphere effect you may spend an additional spell
      point to render the illusion quasi-real, granting it the shadow
      descriptor. If you have a shadow pool you may use a shadow point instead
      of a spell point. Illusions that you grant the (shadow) descriptor to with
      the Shadow Infusion talent are modified in the following ways:</p>

      <p>If you possess Illusionary Touch x2, you may transform the damage dealt
      by the illusion to either acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, electricity,
      piercing, or slashing (chosen when the illusion is created but can be
      altered with the illusion), and may make it either lethal or nonlethal. If
      you also possess Illusionary Sound you may create shadow effects that deal
      sonic damage. If you also possess Manipulate Aura you may spend an
      additional spell point each round to create shadow effects that deal
      force, positive energy, or negative energy damage.</p>

      <p>If an illusion would have a negated effect if disbelieved, a shadow
      version of that illusion instead has its effectiveness reduced by half
      (rounded down). For saving throws, this changes the saves to Fort
      (partial) or Will (partial) instead of Fort (negates) or Will (negates) as
      applicable. Creatures with the Stalwart ability (or similar) features may
      choose to treat shadow illusions as normal illusions upon successfully
      disbelieving the illusion.</p>
