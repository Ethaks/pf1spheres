      "value": "<p>Once per turn when lifting a creature or object with telekinesis (referred to as a Bludgeon), you can spend its remaining movement to strike a creature or object within its reach.</p>\n<p>This is considered a ranged attack and can benefit from feats or combat talents related to weapon and ranged attacks, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity except as provoked by the casting of the telekinesis itself. Making the attack is a standard action; if the caster is both maintaining a telekinesis effect via concentration and making a Bludgeon attack, they need only spend a single action to do both, provided it is the larger action of the two.</p>\n<p>When you use a Bludgeon to strike a target, you must succeed at a ranged attack roll against the target, using your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity for the attack roll.</p>\n<p>On a successful hit, the target and the Bludgeon take damage depending on the Bludgeon&#8217;s size. If the Bludgeon is a weapon, the attack deals appropriate damage for that weapon (bolts and arrows are treated as daggers for this purpose). Since weapons are designed to deal damage, they do not suffer damage themselves if used as a Bludgeon. Objects beyond Colossal are still treated as Colossal for calculating damage.</p>\n<strong>Table: Object Damage</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Object Size</th>\n<th>Damage Dealt</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fine</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Diminutive</td>\n<td>1d2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
