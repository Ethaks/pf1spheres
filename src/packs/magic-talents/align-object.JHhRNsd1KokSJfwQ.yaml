      <p>You may spend a spell point to apply this word to an object or weapon.
      If placed on an object, it counts as a divine focus for all purposes. If
      placed on a weapon, it becomes chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, as you
      choose, overcomes that type of damage reduction, and deals an additional
      2d6 damage to creatures of the opposite alignment. This effect lasts as
      long as you concentrate, but you may always spend a spell point to allow
      the effect to endure for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration.</p>
