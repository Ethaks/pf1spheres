      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (any (material)
      talent), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>Add adamantine and any similarly incredibly rare material that is known
      to you, subject to GM discretion, to the list of materials you can create.
      Treat your caster level as 1/2 for determining both size and duration for
      effects involving adamantine and similar extremely rare materials. This
      can be done permanently with Costly Creation, though the penalty from both
      talents stacks when creating permanent incredibly rare materials.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Metals and other materials similar to adamantine
      in rarity or power may not exist in all campaign settings. In these
      situations, the GM is encouraged to add any setting specific extremely
      rare materials not normally able to be affected by create/alter to the
      list of affected materials granted by this talent. The purpose of this
      talent is to allow access to even the rarest of materials, save for those
      that are divine in nature.</p>
