      <p>You may spend 1 spell point and select a kind of creature, material, or
      other effect that you could divine for or that you could distinguish using
      divine (for example, if you possess Divine Alignment, you could select all
      creatures of a specific alignment). You automatically detect the presence
      of entities of the specified kind within the range of your divine. This
      does not tell you the exact location of such entities, just whether or not
      any are within the area. You may change the type of creature, material, or
      effect whose presence you are sensing with this talent as a full-round
      action.</p>
