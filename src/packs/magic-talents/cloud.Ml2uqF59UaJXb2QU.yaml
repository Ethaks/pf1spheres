      <p>Talents marked with the (cloud) tag allow the caster to spend a
      standard action to create clouds of mental energy that emanate from an
      area, object, or creature within close range. When applying a cloud to an
      unwilling creature or an attended object they are allowed a Will save to
      resist, and both placing a cloud and the effects of a cloud are subject to
      spell resistance. A creature is immune to cloud effects placed upon itself
      or its worn and carried equipment.</p>

      <p>An imbued area may either be 10 feet in radius + an extra 5 feet per
      caster level, or a 10-foot wide area that extends for a length of 10 feet
      + 10 feet per caster level (such as would be appropriate to fill a 10-foot
      wide hallway). An imbued item may be no larger than 5 cubic feet per
      caster level in size. A creature may be up to the caster&#8217;s size + 1
      size category for every 5 caster levels. It is possible to imbue a portion
      of an item or creature (a single head of a massive, two-headed dragon or a
      single segment of a lengthy carpet with blood smeared over it, for
      instance) but hiding a portion of an item or creature will not prevent the
      whole of it from being noticed. Unless otherwise specified, a
      cloud&#8217;s radius extends from an item or creature as if the creature
      was the center of an imbued area measured as a radius.</p>

      <p>As with charms, most clouds have three strengths; lesser, greater, and
      powerful. Spell point expenditures remain the same for the three
      strengths, and you may only affect a creature with a cloud if you could
      also affect it with a charm. Similarly, the Powerful Charm talent is
      required to use the powerful versions of clouds and you may only imbue the
      same item, creature, or area with a lesser cloud once per day. With the
      exception of Mass Charm, (cloud) talents are affected by talents that
      affect charms.</p>
