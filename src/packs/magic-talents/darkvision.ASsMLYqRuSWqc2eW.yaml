    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to grant the target darkvision 60 feet for
      1 hour per caster level. If the target already possesses darkvision, this
      instead increases the range of their darkvision by 30 feet.</p>

      <h3 id="toc4"><span>Dark Talent Types</span></h3>

      <p>Some talents are marked (darkness). These talents add additional
      effects that can be added to a sphere of darkness. Only one such effect
      can be added to a single area of darkness, though areas of different
      darkness can overlap, provided they do not have the same (darkness) talent
      effect.</p>

      <p>Some talents are marked (meld). These talents grant you additional
      melds you can grant to targets.</p>
