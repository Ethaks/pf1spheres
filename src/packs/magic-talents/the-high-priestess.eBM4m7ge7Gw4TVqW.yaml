      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere (one (motif) talent),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may grant a motif that extends the benefits of other motifs
      affecting a target to their allies. When you use this ability, choose a
      motif currently affecting the target to link this motif to. The
      target&#8217;s allies gain the normal effect as long as they are within 30
      feet of the target. When the target discharges the chosen motif, they may
      either choose a different motif affecting the target to link this motif to
      or discharge this motif as part of the same action to grant all allies
      within 30 feet of them an insight bonus to saving throws equal to half
      your caster level for one round. If the target discharges the chosen motif
      but it does not end (such as if they also have the Death motif), they may
      not choose a different motif to link to this motif (it instead remains
      linked to the chosen motif), but may discharge this motif.</p>
