    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that helps the target make the most of their
      current circumstances. The target gains a +2 insight bonus to attacks of
      opportunity and untrained skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for
      every five caster levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this motif to roll initiative and take a
      standard action or move action in a surprise round when they would not
      normally be able to or to take a full-round action or a standard action
      and a move action in a surprise round when they would normally be able to
      take only a standard action or a move action. This does not cause a
      surprise round to occur if it would not normally. The target may discharge
      this motif even when they are flat-footed.</p>
