      <p>You may grant the form of a dragon with your shapeshift.<br>

      <strong>Limbs:</strong> 1 head, 4 legs (front 2 end in hands<sup>1</sup>),
      1 tail<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> Yes; <strong>Hands:</strong> Yes<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 40 ft. land speed<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> bite (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft., a breath weapon. The breath
      weapon is a 60-ft. line or a 30-ft. cone, and deals either fire,
      electricity, acid, or cold damage as chosen at the time it is gained. The
      breath weapon deals 1d8 damage per 2 caster levels, and allows a Reflex
      save for half damage. The target must wait at least 1d4 rounds between
      uses of their breath weapon. A target may only possess one breath weapon
      at a time.</p>

      <p>Dragon Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply
      to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Affinity for Treasure:</strong> The target gains the scent
      ability, except it can detect only precious metals (such as copper,
      silver, and gold), gemstones, and creatures primarily made of such
      materials. In addition, the target gains a bonus equal to half your caster
      level on Appraise checks.</li>

      <li><strong>Breath Weapon:</strong> Gains a breath weapon as given by the
      dragon base form.</li>

      <li>Double the size of a breath weapon (must possess a breath weapon to
      gain this trait).</li>

      <li><strong>Draconic Resistances:</strong> The target gains a +2 racial
      bonus on saving throws made against magic sleep and paralysis, increasing
      by +1 per 5 caster levels. In addition, the target adds half your caster
      level (minimum 1) to the DC of any attempts to intimidate the target.</li>

      <li><strong>Warding Scales:</strong> 1/2 of the target's natural armor
      bonus to AC applies against touch attacks. [SA:EAO]</li>

      </ul>

      <p><sup><strong>1:</strong> The hands granted by Dragon Transformation can
      fulfill somatic components and manipulate items, but they're not suitable
      for combat purposes and cannot wield weapons or shields.</sup></p>
