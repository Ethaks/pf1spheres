      <p>You may make a snare that functions as a magic trap. You may conjure
      and set a snare as a standard action in a square within close range, which
      blends with its surroundings (DC 20 + caster level Perception check for a
      character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is
      tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any
      creature stepping inside the circle. The cord-like object tightens around
      the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled and
      preventing it from moving from that space.</p>

      <p>The snare is magical and can be dispelled as a sphere effect.</p>

      <p>To escape, a trapped creature must attempt an Escape Artist check or
      Strength check equal to your sphere DC as a full-round action. The snare
      has AC and hit points equal to your caster level and hardness equal to
      half your caster level. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop
      and ends the effect, though not the fey-blessing. A snare persists until
      triggered or until the fey-link ends. Only one snare may be set at a time;
      setting an additional snare dismisses all previous snares.</p>
