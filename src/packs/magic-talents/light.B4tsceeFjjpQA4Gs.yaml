      <p>Some talents are designated (light), which add additional effects to
      your glow ability. You may only apply the benefits of one (light) talent
      to any individual glow effect. While you may only apply one such talent to
      an individual glow effect, areas of bright light from different glow
      effects overlap, provided they are augmented by different (light) effects;
      an area cannot be affected by the same (light) effect from multiple
      sources simultaneously.</p>

      <p>When augmenting a glow effect with a (light) talent, the effect is
      applied once per round, at the end of the caster&#8217;s turn. For
      example, if a glowing object is thrown into a large group of enemies, it
      would only affect those within the area where it landed, not those targets
      it passed by to arrive in that area.</p>
