      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Destruction sphere.</p>

      <p>When you gain this blast type, select 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20 blast type
      talents, no more than one being from each blast type group (you may only
      select 20 if you possess Admixture feats, see below). You do not need to
      possess these blast type talents but must meet the prerequisites for any
      advanced blast type talents selected with this ability. Assign each of
      these blast types a single number which could be rolled on a d6, d8, d10,
      d12, or d20 with the die used corresponding to the number of talents you
      have selected (a d6 if you selected 6, etc.).</p>

      <p>When you use Erratic Blast, after deciding on your target(s) but before
      rolling attack rolls or saves, roll a die corresponding to the number of
      talents selected. Use the talent corresponding to the die roll result to
      determine the damage die, damage type and additional effects (including
      feats or class abilities such as Fan The Flames, Frozen To The Bone or
      elementalist&#8217;s favored element) to determine the effects of the
      destructive blast on the target(s). Erratic Blast costs a number of spell
      points equal to the greatest spell point cost of the blast types
      selected.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Admixture talent, you may choose to make the maximum
      possible value of the die (8 for a d8, for an example) be an admixture of
      two other blast types which you have selected for the talent. Roll twice
      more on the table, ignoring any repeat rolls or any further maximum rolls.
      The next two results rolled are used together as an admixture at no
      increased spell point cost. If you have the Greater Admixture talent, you
      instead roll three times and use the next three results rolled for the
      admixture. You cannot use the Admixture talent with an Erratic Blast.</p>

      <p>If you possess any Admixture feats, you may select any effects that you
      could apply to an admixture (such as ghost strikes if you possess Ghostly
      Admixture). As with (blast type) talents, you need not possess these
      talents but must meet their prerequisites.</p>

      <p>If these abilities have variable spell point costs, determine the
      number of spell points you would spend on each of these effects when you
      select them as blast types for this talent (for example, you may choose to
      have your Lich Strike have an effective spell point cost of 1 or 3 for the
      purpose of determining the cost of an Erratic Blast which incorporates it,
      with the ghost strike having different effects corresponding to the number
      of spell points spent).</p>

      <p>You can change the blast types or admixture effects selected with this
      talent whenever you level up.</p>

      <p>For example, Astore is an elementalist with the Admixture talent. He
      creates the following table to determine the effect of his destructive
      blast whenever he uses it. As none of the blast types he has selected cost
      additional spell points, he does not need to spend additional spell points
      to use Erratic Blast.</p>
