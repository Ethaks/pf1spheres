      <p>You may create an aegis that protects against the forces of nature.
      This grants a +4 bonus to AC and saving throws against all forms of
      environmental damage (though not from vacuum), attacks that utilize nature
      as a resource (such as lightning called from the sky, but not from all
      electricity attacks), abilities of the Nature and Weather spheres, and the
      spell, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of fey creatures, magical
      beasts, and plant creatures.</p>
