      <p>Your companion may shift its coloration to mimic its environment,
      granting a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to 1 + 1/2 the
      companion&#8217;s Hit Dice. Additionally, the companion gains 1 rank in
      the Stealth skill per Hit Die; if it already possesses ranks in the
      Stealth skill, those ranks may be immediately re-trained at no cost.</p>
