    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to move in a straight line up to your
      destructive blast&#8217;s range. This movement provokes attacks of
      opportunity as normal. You may pass through occupied spaces by making an
      overrun maneuver as a free action against the targets, using your caster
      level + your casting ability modifier in place of your base attack bonus +
      your Strength modifier for this check. If a target attempts to impede you
      during this overrun, they suffer the effects of your destructive blast
      (Reflex half), whether or not they succeed in stopping your movement. You
      may also attempt to crash through objects or barriers, dealing your
      destructive blast damage to them, and passing through unimpeded if this
      successfully destroys them. If, however, a target successfully stops you
      during an overrun or you are unable to destroy an object or barrier, your
      movement immediately stops at the nearest unoccupied space and you are
      staggered for one round.</p>
