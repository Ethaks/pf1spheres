    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point as a standard action to gain the ability to
      speak with undead and corpses for 1 minute per caster level. You can
      communicate with, ask questions of, and receive answers from them. A
      mindless undead or corpse spoken to with gravetongue does not maintain any
      memory of its life or death - only the time that has elapsed since its
      death (and reanimation).</p>

      <p>A normal corpse&#8217;s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it
      will not be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures
      or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell
      does not make undead creatures any more friendly or cooperative than
      normal, and while mindless undead and corpses will always answer
      truthfully, their ability to answer more than simple questions is
      restricted. You do not need to share a language with the target.</p>
