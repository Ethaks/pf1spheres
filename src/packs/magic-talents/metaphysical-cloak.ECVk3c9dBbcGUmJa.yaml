      <p>Choose an alignment within one step of your own on each axis. The
      target of this word is treated as this alignment instead of their own for
      all purposes unless they succeed on a Will saving throw. This does not
      change its actual alignment, and so does not influence the target&#8217;s
      actions or cause it to violate any code of conduct it might have. This
      effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend a spell
      point to allow the effect to endure for 1 hour per caster level without
      concentration.</p>
