      "value": "<p>Your companion gains either darkvision 60 feet, low-light vision, or the scent ability. If your companion possesses darkvision from another source, increase its range by 30 feet. If it already possesses the scent ability, it may either increase its range to 60 feet or gain the keen scent ability.</p>\n<p><em>Keen Scent:</em> The companion can notice other creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you or your companion possesses any of the following spheres, you may choose the following special senses instead of one listed above:</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain the see in darkness ability. You must spend 1 additional spell point as part of your summon to grant your companion the benefit from this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain lifesense 30 feet. The creature notices and locates living creatures within range, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. You must spend 2 additional spell points as part of your summon to grant your companion the benefit of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain thoughtsense 30 feet. This ability functions similarly to blindsight. Nondetection, mind blank, and similar effects can block thoughtsense. Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and nonsentient (Intelligence 1-2) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects. You must spend 2 additional spell points as part of your summon to grant your companion the benefit of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature Sphere ((earth) package):</strong> Your companion may either gain the ability to see through up to 5 feet of dirt and stone or gain tremorsense 30 feet. You must spend 1 additional spell point as part of your summon to grant your companion tremorsense. A companion with tremorsense is sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground. Aquatic creatures with tremorsense can also sense the location of creatures moving through water.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature Sphere ((fire) package):</strong> Your companion may gain the ability to see through both magical and mundane smoke, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature Sphere ((metal) package):</strong> Your companion gains the scent metal ability. This ability functions much the same as the scent ability, except that the range is 90 feet and the companion can only use it to sense metal objects (including creatures wearing or carrying metal objects). If the companion already has the scent ability, increase the range of this ability by the companion&#8217;s scent range.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature Sphere ((plant) package):</strong> Your companion can see through thick plant matter as though it were transparent, with a range of 30 feet. Leaves, vines, greenery, and undergrowth offer no concealment to the companion&#8217;s sight, though solid wood still blocks its line of sight.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature Sphere ((water) package):</strong> Your companion may see through fog, mist, and murky water as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Telekinesis Sphere:</strong> Your companion may gain touchsight 30 feet. You must spend 2 additional spell points as part of your summon to grant your companion the benefit from this ability. Your companion may ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment, though it must have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. It does not need to attempt Perception checks to notice creatures; it can detect and pinpoint all creatures within 30 feet.</p>\n<p>A companion may gain this talent multiple times. Each time it gains this talent, select a new sense or increase the range of their darkvision by 30 feet. If a selected ability requires an additional spell point cost, the caster must choose to grant the ability and pay the cost each time the companion is summoned.</p>\n",
