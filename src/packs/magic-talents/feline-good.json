      "value": "<p>The recipients of your life magic are momentarily protected by your affection and care, the harsh effects momentarily stalled as your magic gently caresses them.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere (Lingering Resilience), caster level 5th.</p>\n<p>As a special application of restore, instead of removing a condition from the target, you grant the target a protective mark for 1 minute per caster level. The next time the target would be affected by a negative condition, the protective mark&#8217;s duration immediately ends and the target delays the onset of the negative condition for a number of rounds equal to 1/4 your caster level (minimum 1). A negative condition delayed by this effect must be one that could be removed with a restore sphere effect or the Break Enchantment talent; rounds spent delaying the negative condition do not count toward the negative condition&#8217;s duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the target delayed its effect several rounds). A creature cannot have more than one protective mark from this talent at one time.</p>\n<p>The spell point cost of a restore effect modified by this talent is reduced by 1 sp (minimum 0). If you spend an additional spell point, you may use this talent as an immediate action; however, the duration of a protective mark applied as part of a swift or immediate action is reduced to 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Life sphere Resurrection advanced talent, this talent may delay an effect which would immediately kill the target through non-hit point damage (such as some death effects); the target dies normally after this effect&#8217;s duration ends.</p>\n",
