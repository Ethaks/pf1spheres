      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Animated Shadow (advanced, shadow), Shadow Lurk (shadow)), caster level 15th.</p>\n<p>You may spend 3 spell points as a standard action to split off your shadow to act as an independent creature unwaveringly loyal to you for one hour per caster level. Your shadow double has the same attributes and statistics as you do, but half as many hit points, and its copies of your equipment are entirely non-magical.</p>\n<p>If it removes or drops its copied equipment, it disappears after 1 round. You may give your shadow double additional equipment to use, including magical equipment, but you share one set of magic item slots and may not both benefit from an item in the same slot. It casts spells and uses spell-like abilities as you do, but you both draw from the same pool of spell points, spell-like abilities, spell slots, and memorized spells. Your shadow double may move any distance from you as long as it remains on the same plane of existence.</p>\n<p>You do not cast a shadow while this ability is active, nor may you use or be the target of any abilities or talents that affect your shadow while your shadow double is active.</p>\n<p>Reattaching your shadow double is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Either you or your shadow double may spend this action. If your shadow double is killed or removed from the same plane of existence as you, it winks out of existence and drops any non-copied equipment or items it is carrying, and your shadow returns with a surge of energy that causes you to be stunned for 1d4 rounds. In either case, you immediately gain the knowledge of everything your shadow double observed and did while it was detached.</p>\n",
