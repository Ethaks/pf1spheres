      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere (Resuscitate), caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 3 spell points and 1 minute to bring a dead target back
      to life. A target cannot have been dead for more than 1 day per caster
      level, the creature&#8217;s body must be reasonably intact (i.e., it
      cannot be missing a vital component such as its head or heart), and the
      target&#8217;s soul must be willing to return (an unwilling target cannot
      be forcibly resurrected). The target is restored to full health and any
      ability scores drained or damaged to 0 are raised to 1, but otherwise, any
      conditions the target was under when it died return when it is raised
      (disease, poison, curses, etc.). A restore can be applied simultaneously
      with the resurrection to counteract these conditions.</p>

      <p>Missing body parts are not restored, although the wounds are sealed and
      do not bleed. The target also gains two permanent negative levels when it
      is raised or suffers 2 points of Constitution drain for every negative
      level it would be reduced below 1st level. If this would reduce the
      target&#8217;s Constitution to 0 or less, it cannot be raised. You cannot
      raise a target that has died of old age.</p>
