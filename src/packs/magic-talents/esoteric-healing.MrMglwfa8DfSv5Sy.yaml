      <p>When you use your Life sphere abilities, you may choose for them to not
      be positive energy effects. Used this way, your Life sphere abilities can
      affect non-living creatures such as constructs or undead, though they do
      not work on inanimate objects. This does not allow you to harm creatures
      you could not harm before with positive energy.</p>
