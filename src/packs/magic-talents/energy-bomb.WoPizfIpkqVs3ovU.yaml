    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you may touch a small container of liquid and
      spend a spell point to instill a destructive blast inside it. As a
      standard action, this can be primed and thrown as a splash weapon. A
      direct hit deals the destructive blast&#8217;s damage to the target and
      damage equal to the minimum blast damage is dealt in a 5-foot splash
      radius. Any creature taking damage from either the direct hit or the
      splash must save against any additional effects of the blast type.</p>

      <p>This cannot be used with the Gather Energy talent. An instilled liquid
      remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have
      equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water
      is considered negligible. You may target food (in which instead of a
      splash weapon it affects the target who consumes it) but not an
      already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent and
      all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the
      instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a
      single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single
      action.</p>
