      <p>You may spend a spell point to have your destructive blast become a
      stream of water, pounding your foe, disorienting and choking them. This
      deals bludgeoning damage and any creature struck by the attack or that
      failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required are considered wet
      and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The
      water disappears at the end of your turn, but fires extinguished or
      creatures soaked by the water continue to be so.</p>
