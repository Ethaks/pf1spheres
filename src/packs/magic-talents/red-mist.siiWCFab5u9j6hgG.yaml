    value: >
      <p>As a move action, you may cause a creature under the effects of your
      blood control and suffering from bleed damage to have their lost blood
      disperse into a mist, filling their space, granting them concealment
      (attacks made by the creature or targeting the creature have a 20% miss
      chance). This effect persists until you end it as a free action, the
      creature stops taking bleed damage, or your blood control ends. Your
      vision is not impaired by a mist you create.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point, the radius of the mist
      increases to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. The mist obscures all
      sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has
      concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have
      total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to
      locate the target).</p>

      <p>A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses
      the mist in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 1
      round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the mist in
      the explosive or fiery spell&#8217;s area. A wall of fire burns away the
      mist in the area into which it deals damage. If dispersed or burned away,
      the mist returns at the start of the creature&#8217;s next turn unless the
      bleed damage or blood control has ended.</p>

      <p>If you choose to take 1 Constitution damage when using this talent, you
      may treat all creatures within the mist as if they were below half their
      maximum hit points for the purpose of the save penalty on any instance of
      blood control targeting such a creature.</p>
