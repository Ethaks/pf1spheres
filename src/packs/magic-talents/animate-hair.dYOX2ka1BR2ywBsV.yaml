      <p>Your hair grows long and animates. You may activate the following
      abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Entangling Locks:</strong> Any hostile creature must succeed on
      a Reflex save any time it becomes or starts its turn adjacent to you. A
      creature that fails its save cannot move away from you without first
      succeeding on a Strength check or an Escape Artist check against your
      sphere DC made as a move action.</p>

      <p><strong>Grasping Tresses:</strong> You may use your hair to grab
      objects. Your hair grants a slam attack (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small,
      bludgeoning damage), but may not assist in wielding weapons, activate
      magic items, or wield a shield. It may hold items and as a swift action
      you can use it to draw a sheathed or hidden weapon, ready a shield,
      retrieve a stored item, load a crossbow, open a door, pick up an
      unattended item within your natural reach, sheathe or store an item, or
      take other non-offensive actions involving manipulating objects.</p>
