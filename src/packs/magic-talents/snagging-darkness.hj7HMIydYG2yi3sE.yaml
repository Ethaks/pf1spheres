      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a blot effect filled with dark
      tendrils that reach out and snare anything that passes. The entire area is
      considered difficult terrain, and every creature within the area is the
      target of a grapple check when the blot is created and each round it is
      maintained. Creatures who enter this area are also immediately subject to
      a grapple check. The CMB for this check is equal to your caster level +
      your casting ability modifier. If successful, the target gains the
      grappled condition, suffers 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels
      (minimum 1d6), and cannot move without first breaking free of the grapple
      (the CMD of this effect is equal to its CMB + 10). Just as with a normal
      grappler, this effect gains a +5 circumstance bonus on grapple checks made
      against targets it is already grappling.</p>
