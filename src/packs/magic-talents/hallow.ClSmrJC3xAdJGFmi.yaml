    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to hallow a target for 1 minute per caster
      level. Choose an end of the alignment spectrum (good, evil, lawful,
      chaotic); you must choose an alignment that you possess. The target of
      this word gains a +1 sacred bonus (profane bonus if you are evil; if you
      are neither good nor evil you must choose whether you grant sacred or
      profane bonuses with this sphere) to attack rolls, AC, and saving throws
      made against targets of your opposed alignment (evil for good, lawful for
      chaotic, etc.). This bonus increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels
      possessed.</p>

      <p>The target also gains immunity to any spell or sphere effect that
      possesses or exercises mental control over them (including enchantment
      charm effects and enchantment compulsion effects), so long as that effect
      originates from a creature who possesses your opposed alignment. If the
      target is already under the influence of such an effect, the target is
      allowed to attempt a new saving throw against the controlling effect.
      Success means the effect is suppressed for the duration of this word, but
      resumes when this word expires. This does not expel a controlling life
      force (such as a ghost or projected spirit), but it does prevent them from
      controlling the target.</p>

      <h3 id="toc4"><span>Fate Talent Types</span></h3>

      <p>Some talents are marked (word). These grant you additional words of
      power.</p>

      <p>Some talents are marked (consecration). These grant you additional
      consecrations.</p>
