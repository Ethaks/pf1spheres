      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere (Friend To Wildlife
      (spirit)), caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>As an instantaneous effect, you may, as a standard action, spend 3
      spell points to call a specific fey, magical beast, plant or vermin of a
      type you designate (provided the creature&#8217;s CR is equal to or less
      than 1/2 your caster level) which then appears in a place within range at
      the start of your next turn, and remains for up to 1 hour per caster
      level. Unlike Friend To Wildlife, this advanced talent does not require
      that there are creatures of those types in the area. The creature will aid
      the caster to the best of its ability, but unless the caster speaks the
      creature&#8217;s language, only basic communication is possible (attacking
      an enemy, defending the caster, etc.) The creature must also be treated
      fairly and will not give aid that is obviously suicidal. If treated
      poorly, they may turn on and attack the caster. A caster may not use
      Natural Ally more than once per day.</p>
