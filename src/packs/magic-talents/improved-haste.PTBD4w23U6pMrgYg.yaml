    value: >
      <p>When you use Haste on a target, that target may either make an
      additional attack at their highest base attack bonus when making a full
      attack, or make additional attacks of opportunity during the round (+1
      attack of opportunity, +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess). The
      target may only benefit from one such benefit per round; if they make a
      full attack with a bonus attack, they do not gain additional attacks of
      opportunity that round. This effect is not cumulative with similar
      effects, such as that provided by the haste spell or a speed weapon, and
      taking a full attack with a bonus attack from such a source counts as
      choosing that option for Haste for that round.</p>
