      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere (Restore Health (cure),
      Revitalize), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When you use the Revitalize talent on a creature, you may spend 2
      additional spell points to make the creature exceptionally vital on a
      cellular level for the duration of the revitalization. Every cell of their
      body is so imbued with positive energy that they are no longer a single
      living being, but a collection of living cells creating a gestalt. Each
      individual cell can survive on its own and actively fights to keep the
      whole body functioning: blood will crawl back into the wounds that
      released them, broken bones will straighten themselves, and wounds will
      actively close and seal shut.</p>

      <p>The hypervitalized creature gains the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Immunity to bleed, death effects, damage from positive energy effects,
      disease (magical and non-magical), paralysis, poison, sleep effects, aging
      effects, and stunning.</li>

      <li>Not subject to nonlethal damage of any kind. Immunity to damage or
      drain to its ability scores, as well as to exhaustion and fatigue effects.
      These do not protect the character from the results of their own abilities
      (such as nonlethal damage caused by the Draining Casting drawback) or
      voluntarily gained through helpful effects (such as the Overclocked
      talent).</li>

      <li>Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the
      effect also works on objects or is harmless).</li>

      <li>The fast healing granted by Revitalize is upgraded to regeneration;
      severed limbs can be reattached to the body (and indeed, will try to
      reattach themselves if possible). The target is not at risk of death from
      massive damage, not disabled at 0 hit points, and at negative hit points
      is unconscious but stable, even if exceeding the Constitution score. It
      can only be killed if the body is deliberately destroyed, such as being
      immolated or disintegrated, or by allowing the effect to expire while at
      negative hit points greater than their Constitution score. Creatures that
      possess abilities that allow them to stay conscious at 0 or fewer hit
      points still fall unconscious if they would normally die from the amount
      of damage they have received.</li>

      <li>Does not need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep.</li>

      </ul>
