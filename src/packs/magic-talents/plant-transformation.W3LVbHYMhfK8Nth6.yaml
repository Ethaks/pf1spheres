      <p>You may grant the form of a plant creature with your shapeshift.<br>

      <strong>Limbs:</strong> 2 arms (which may be tree limbs or vines)<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> No; <strong>Hands:</strong> No<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft. land speed<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> 2 slams (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +4 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft. The target is considered to
      have the plant creature type (in addition to their other creature types)
      for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a
      ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons).</p>

      <p>Plant Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply
      to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Barkskin:</strong> You may grant the target a +2 natural armor
      bonus, which stacks with other sources of natural armor.</li>

      <li><strong>Pollen:</strong> As a swift action, the target can release a
      cloud of pollen with a radius up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster levels
      centered on the target which persists until the start of the
      target&#8217;s next turn. Creatures other than the target who begin their
      turn or enter the cloud of pollen are staggered for one round (Fortitude
      negates; DC equal to the caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC). A creature
      that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
      The pollen trait&#8217;s effects are a poison effect; bonuses or
      immunities against inhaled effects function against this trait&#8217;s
      effects. [SA:EAO]</li>

      <li><strong>Rigid Body:</strong> You may grant the target a +2 natural
      armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels, which does not stack with other
      sources of natural armor.</li>

      <li><strong>Sporepod:</strong> Once per minute as a standard action, the
      target can launch a sporepod. Treat this as a splash weapon with a range
      increment of 20 feet. While a direct hit deals no damage, any creature
      within 10 + 5 feet per 5 caster levels from the sporepod&#8217;s point of
      contact is confused for 1+1d6 rounds (Will partial; DC equal to the
      caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC). A creature that succeeds at its save
      is sickened for 1 round instead. The sporepod is a mind-affecting poison
      effect. This trait costs an additional spell point. [SA:EAO]</li>

      <li><strong>Strong Roots:</strong> The target gains a bonus to CMD equal
      to 2 + 1 per 10 caster levels against bull rush, drag, reposition, and
      trip combat maneuvers or other effects which would attempt to knock the
      target prone or forcibly move them. This bonus doubles if the target
      starts and ends his turn in the same space.</li>

      <li><strong>Thorn Spray:</strong> As a standard action, the target can
      spray a volley of thorns dealing 1d4 piercing per 2 caster levels damage
      to all creatures in a 30-foot cone or 15-foot radius burst centered on the
      target (Reflex half; DC equal to the caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC).
      The target must wait at least 1d4 rounds between uses of this ability.
      Creatures who fail their save against this ability have thorns embedded in
      their body, taking a -2 penalty on Reflex saves and Dexterity-based skill
      checks. These penalties increase by 1 per 5 caster levels. Creatures may
      spend a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity to remove these
      thorns. [SA:EAO]</li>
