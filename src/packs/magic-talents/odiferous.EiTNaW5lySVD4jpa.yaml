      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Inured:</strong> The target gains a +2 competence bonus on any
      save to resist the sickened and nauseated conditions and against poison
      effects. This bonus increases by +1 per 4 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Nauseating Spray:</strong> Once per minute, as a standard
      action the target may spray noxious chemicals in a 15-foot cone. Any
      creature in this cone must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 +
      1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. If you
      spend an additional spell point when granting this trait, the affected
      creatures are nauseated for 1d6 rounds on a failed save and sickened for 1
      round on a successful save. The size of the cone increases by 5 feet per 5
      caster levels. This counts as a poison effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Stench:</strong> The target secretes a stinking chemical
      offensive to most living things. Any creature adjacent to the target must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened until 1d6 rounds after they are
      no longer adjacent. A creature that saves against this effect is immune to
      any instance of it from the same caster for 24 hours. This is a poison
      effect.</p>
