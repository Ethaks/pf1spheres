      "value": "<p>Your control over fire extends to a level of mastery over temperature. You gain the following geomancing abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Trail Blaze:</strong> Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point to create a wave of ash, hot air and smoke in 120-foot line which reveals a safe path to traverse, allowing creatures to ignore difficult terrain within the affected area for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Creatures who are caught in the area of effect when first cast must attempt a Fortitude save or become exhausted, creatures that succeed at their saves become fatigued instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Concentration, you must possess the (water) package. you may, as a standard action, cause a 5-foot cube of water per 2 caster levels (minimum one 5-foot cube) within range to heat up and boil, dealing 1d6 per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6, no save) fire damage to any creature within. Each round at the beginning of your turn, any creature still within the boiling water suffers damage again. If a creature enters the boiling water, they immediately suffer damage, but only once during their movement, no matter how many times that movement takes them in and out of the boiling water.</p>\n<p><strong>Melt Earth:</strong> Concentration, you must possess the (earth) package. You may spend 2 spell points as a standard action to melt the surface of a 5-foot square of sand, dirt, or stone, plus another contiguous 5-foot square per 5 caster levels, transmuting the top inch per caster level into lava. This is not enough lava to create vortexes. Creatures who enter this square or begin their turn in this square suffer 1d6 fire damage per caster level (Reflex half, targets who are in the square when the lava is created may instead attempt a Reflex save to move out of the space and avoid all damage).</p>\n<p>Even after a creature leaves the lava, creatures who failed a saving throw against this lava suffer half damage each round for 1d3 rounds (no save). A creature may spend a full-round action to remove the lava and end this effect for future rounds. If a creature is within this square when the effect ends, the earth instantly cools around the creature, immobilizing it (Reflex negates).</p>\n<p>An immobilized creature cannot move until it succeeds at Strength or Escape Artist check against the caster&#8217;s Nature DC, both of which require a full-round action. Alternatively, another creature may attempt a Strength check as a standard action to break the earth, or any creature may deal 5 damage per caster level to the earth to break it.</p>\n",
