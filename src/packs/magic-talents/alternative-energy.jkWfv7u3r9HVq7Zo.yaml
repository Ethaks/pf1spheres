      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere (Energy Enhancement
      (enhance)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>When enhancing a weapon with Energy Enhancement, you may choose sonic
      damage. At 10th caster level, you may choose force damage. Treat these
      choices as though they were the flaming weapon special ability, but
      instead dealing sonic or force damage respectively.</p>
