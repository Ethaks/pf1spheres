      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Cold of severity
      level 4 or higher, their unarmed strike deals 1 additional slashing damage
      and any creature striking them with an unarmed strike or natural weapon
      takes 1 slashing damage. This damage increases by 2 for each category
      above severity level 4.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The increased slashing damage applies
      to both unarmed strikes and natural attacks.</p>
