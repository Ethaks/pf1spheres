      <p>Precipitation has the most severe interaction with the other weather
      categories, as the conditions change depending on the temperature and
      wind.</p>

      <p>When combined with Cold severity 4 or higher, snow effects are added to
      rain effects. When combined with Wind severity 4 or higher, storm effects
      are added to the rain effects. When combined with both Cold severity 4 and
      Wind severity 4, this results in rain, snow, and storm effects. Mist and
      fog are the exceptions to this, as they only appear when rain is not
      combined with either snow nor storm.</p>

      <p>Severity of the snow or storm effects depends on the severity of the
      Precipitation, not the severity of the Wind or Cold.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> While water freezes at Cold severity 3, magic
      cannot cause rain to instantly become snow as it falls until severity
      level 4, since the magical water/cold is only augmenting the natural
      process, not replacing it.</p>

      <p><strong>Rain Effects</strong><br>

      <strong>Mist:</strong> Mist grants all creatures concealment from any
      creatures over 100 feet away (all attacks suffer a 20% miss chance).</p>

      <p><strong>Fog:</strong> The caster may create light rain or fog. If fog
      is chosen, it obscures all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision.
      Creatures 5 feet away have concealment.</p>

      <p><strong>Other rain effects:</strong> Beginning at severity level 4,
      rain has the same effect on fires, ranged attacks, and Perception checks
      as wind of equal severity level. This does not stack with the penalties
      provided by wind. The rain also cuts visibility ranges by half, resulting
      in an additional &#8211;4 penalty on Perception checks due to poor
      visibility. It rains about 1 inch per hour at severity 4, 2 inches per
      hour at severity level 5, 5 inches per hour at severity level 6, and 10
      inches per hour at severity level 7.</p>

      <p><strong>Snow Effects</strong><br>

      Snow causes squares to count as difficult terrain. This requires 24 hours
      of snow at severity level 1, 8 hours at severity level 2, 1 hour at
      severity level 3, and happens immediately at severity level 4. At severity
      level 5, snow obscures vision as fog does. It costs 4 squares of movement
      to enter a square covered with heavy snow (about 2 feet). This requires 24
      hours at severity level 4, 8 hours at severity level 5, 1 hour at severity
      level 6, and happens immediately at severity level 7. Heavy snow
      accompanied by strong or severe winds might also result in snowdrifts 1d4
      &#215; 5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect
      the wind&#8212;a cabin or a large tent, for instance.</p>

      <p><strong>Storm Effects</strong><br>

      Beginning at severity level 4, storms will randomly strike a square with
      lightning, dealing 4d8 electricity damage (Reflex half) to everything in
      or above that square. This happens once per minute. This damage increases
      by 2d8 for every severity level above 4, to a maximum of 10d8 at severity
      level 7.</p>
