    value: >
      <p>You may place a glow on a manufactured weapon, a piece of armor or a
      shield. When placed on a weapon, it does full damage to incorporeal
      creatures. If placed on a shield or piece of armor, you may apply its full
      bonus to AC against the melee attacks of incorporeal creatures.</p>

      <p>If you cause this glow to shed bright light, you can cause the glowing
      item to duplicate the effect of any single metal or material, chosen when
      this ability is used. The glowing object counts as a material for
      weaknesses and damage reduction, but is not otherwise that material.</p>
