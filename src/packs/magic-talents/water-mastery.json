      "value": "<p>Your mastery of water is delicate and intricate. You may manipulate snow as if it were liquid water.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain the following geomancing abilities:</p>\n<p><strong>Air Bubble:</strong> Concentration, requires both water and air, meaning it usually must be used at the water&#8217;s surface. You may fold water in such a way that it traps air inside of it. This can take one of two forms: You may create either an individual air bubble around a creature&#8217;s head, or create a large bubble measuring up to 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels in radius. You may move this bubble as if it were a Vortex. An individual air bubble allows a creature to breathe underwater for 1 hour normally, but otherwise does not impede swimming. A larger air bubble traps significantly more air, and allows those inside to remain dry and walk on the ground at the bottom of the body of water as if it were ground. A large air bubble contains enough air for a Medium creature to breathe normally for 6 hours per 5 feet in the bubble&#8217;s radius.</p>\n<p><em>Slow Suffocation:</em> A medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that time, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15 minutes. Each additional medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. Once rendered unconscious through the accumulation of nonlethal damage, the character begins to take lethal damage at the same rate. Small characters consume half as much air as medium characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Push Swimmer:</strong> Instantaneous. You may move creatures and objects within a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area that are surrounded or submerged in water up to 5 feet per 2 caster levels in any direction that ends with them still in water (Reflex negates if unwilling). A target slammed into a solid object suffers 1d6 falling damage per 10 feet of movement.</p>\n",
