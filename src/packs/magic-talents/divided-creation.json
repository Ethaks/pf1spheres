      "value": "<p>When creating an object, you may instead create multiple objects within range. Each created object must be of the same general type (suits of armor, wall sections, catapults, etc.), and the total size of all created objects cannot exceed your maximum creation size. Alternatively, you may create a single &#8216;object&#8217; that would normally consist of a multitude of parts (i.e., if creating a tavern with this talent, it would appear with chairs, beds, barrels, etc.).</p>\n<p>Just as two Small objects counts as a Medium object and two Medium objects counts as a Large object, two Tiny objects count as a Small object, two Diminutive objects count as a Tiny object, etc. You may drop multiple objects as an attack, but each object must target a different square (up to 4 objects that are Tiny or smaller can target a single square, but any attack roll is done once for each object). A creature may be targeted only by as many falling objects as could target any square or squares the creature occupies.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may attempt to drop enough small objects to bury a target, creating a cave-in or a similar effect on top of them. This deals damage as normal for a single falling object of whatever material is chosen, but also has the chance of burying the target as if the dropped material were a soft material such as cloth.</p>\n<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Creation sphere can target larger creatures with more objects than smaller ones, but this has always been viewed as an abuse of the sphere's effects for the \"sake of realism\". GMs should heavily consider limiting the number of objects which can target a single creature to 4 objects, regardless of the creatures actual size. Larger creatures should not be taking unusually larger amounts of damage than a smaller foe would under the same circumstances.</p>\n<p>GMs may consider allowing Creation sphere to use the rules as written use of Divided Creation, but treat the interaction as though it were an advanced talent, understanding that allowing this interaction greatly increases Creation sphere's damage against a single large target.</p>\n",
