      "value": "<p>A white cat and black cat both watched on, as the tall ones quibbled. They laughed, and played, and so the tall ones experienced both fortune and misfortune with a wave of their paws.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 5th.</p>\n<p>You gain the following Fate sphere abilities which manipulate luck and rolled dice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Felicity (consecration):</strong> While this consecration is in effect, the success and failure of all creatures in the area is manipulated. When you create this consecration, choose &#8220;weal&#8221; or &#8220;woe&#8221;. If you chose &#8220;weal&#8221;, all creatures treat a naturally rolled 19 on a d20 as though it were a natural 20. If you chose &#8220;woe&#8221;, all creatures treat a naturally rolled 2 on a d20 as though it were a natural 1. This consecration&#8217;s &#8220;woe&#8221; effect is considered a curse effect. For every 10 caster levels you possess, the range which weal and woe manipulate naturally rolls as 20 and 1 respectively increases by +1 (e.g. caster level 10 weal would treat a naturally rolled 18-20 as a natural 20). You must concentrate to maintain this consecration. You may always spend an additional spell point as a free action to allow this consecration to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.</li>\n<li><strong>Boon (word):</strong> After a creature within range makes a d20 roll, as an immediate action, you may grant the target a +1 luck bonus to that roll. If you spend 1 additional spell point, this bonus increases to +2 + 1 per 10 caster levels. You may use this word after the results of the d20 roll are revealed, which may change the results of the d20 roll into a success.</li>\n<li><strong>Jinx (word) [curse]:</strong> After a creature within range makes a d20 roll, as an immediate action, you may cause the target to suffer a -1 penalty to that roll. If you spend 1 additional spell point, this penalty increases to -2 - 1 per 10 caster levels. You may use this word after the results of the target&#8217;s d20 roll are revealed, which may change the results of the d20 roll into a failure. An unwilling target may attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> A d20 roll modified by the Felicity (consecration) cannot be modified by other effects (such as the Tug Fate (consecration)) but can be rerolled.</p>\n",
