      <p>You may spend a spell point to divine for things expressly designed to
      be hidden. This includes secret doors, hidden caches, and secret
      compartments. Not only does this detect the presence of such secrets, but
      it also gives you knowledge of their trigger mechanisms. This only detects
      doors, passages, and openings specifically designed to avoid
      detection.</p>
