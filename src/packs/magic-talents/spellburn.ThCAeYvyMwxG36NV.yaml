      <p>You may spend a spell point and attempt a magic skill check against
      your target. If successful, you burn a number of spell points from the
      target&#8217;s spell pool, removing it from their spell pool as if they
      had used the spell point themselves (although this does not trigger
      effects that rely on spell points being spent, such as drawbacks from the
      target&#8217;s casting tradition, or the triggering of wild magic). The
      amount of spell points burned starts 1d3 and increases at 5th level and
      every four caster levels thereafter (up to a maximum of 3d6 at 25th caster
      level), as listed under Table: Burn Dice.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The expunge ability is created with the
      intention of being used upon other spellcasters that utilize the Spheres
      of Power system of magic, but can be made to work with other systems of
      magic as well. When used against a spellcaster that utilizes the core
      system of magic in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, a GM may allow it to
      burn spell slots or spells prepared. To calculate which spells are
      affected, total the number of spell points burned. The caster suffering
      from the Spellburn talent may then choose an amount of spell slots or
      prepared spells to lose. They must choose an amount of spells that amount
      to the points cost, following this list to determine the value of each
      spell level in spell points:</p>

      <p><strong>Level 1-2:</strong> 1 spell point, <strong>Level 3-5:</strong>
      2 spell points, <strong>Level 6-8:</strong> 3 spell points, <strong>Level
      9:</strong> 4 spell points.</p>

      <p>If there is an amount of spell points remaining that the spellcaster
      cannot sacrifice spells of a level to make up for without going above the
      amount (for example, only losing 1 spell point but not having any 1st or
      2nd level spell slots/prepared spells left), they may ignore the remainder
      without sacrificing additional spell slots. When used on creatures with
      psionic manifesting (Psionics Unleashed by Dreamscarred Press), the
      creature loses a number of power points equal to the number of spell
      points that would have been lost multiplied by 1 + its Hit Dice/4.</p>
