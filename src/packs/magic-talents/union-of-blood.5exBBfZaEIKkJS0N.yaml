      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>By spending 10 minutes and 3 spell points, you may complete a complex
      ritual with two willing targets who could be placed under your blood
      control, entwining their life forces. The targets of this effect combine
      and share their hit point total, with current and maximum hit points equal
      to the combined total of both targets. Any effect that changes the hit
      point total of either target (such as damage, healing, or changes to
      Constitution) changes this combined total. Temporary hit points are not
      shared by this effect, and effects which would delay or prevent incoming
      damage function normally (e.g. the Guardian sphere delayed damage pool
      would delay damage to the target as normal. When the delayed damage is
      emptied from the delayed damage pool it would then subtracted from the
      combined hit point total).</p>

      <p>This is a permanent effect which automatically ends if any of the
      targets die, the effect is dispelled, or the hit point total is reduced to
      0 or less. If the hit point total is reduced to 0 or less, the targets are
      left with current hit points equal to the combined hit point total when
      the effect ended (e.g. if the hit point total is reduced to -5 by an
      attack, the effect ends and each creature would be left with -5 hit
      points). If this effect would otherwise end prematurely, such as a target
      dying to a death effect or the effect being dispelled, each creature is
      left with a number of hit points equal to the hit point total divided by
      the number of targets. If you possess the Mass Blood Magic talent, you may
      include an additional target per 2 caster levels.</p>
