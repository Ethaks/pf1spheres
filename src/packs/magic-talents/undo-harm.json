      "value": "<p>While this consecration is in effect, every creature within the area regains 5 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level at the beginning of their turn, but only up to the amount of damage they have taken since their last turn and since you created this consecration. This consecration affects all creatures, but you may spend a spell point when you create this consecration to make it only affect your allies. If a creature has taken enough damage to kill or destroy it, this consecration has no effect on them. This stacks with fast healing and, as it is cosmic in origin rather than positive energy, affects non-living creatures such as undead and constructs. You must concentrate to maintain this consecration, but you may spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect to continue for 1 round per caster level without concentration.</p>\n<p>If you take this talent a second time you may cause the consecration to reverse negative conditions in addition to damage. While this consecration is in effect, as an immediate action you may spend a spell point to allow any one creature suffering from bleed damage or the blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shakened, sickened, or stunned conditions to be cured of one of these conditions of their choice at the end of their turn. For every 10 caster levels, they may cure one additional condition. This effect can only remove effects that have been inflicted since the end of the sufferer&#8217;s last turn and since you created this consecration.</p>\n",
