      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a divisive totem. While within
      this totem, enemies lose trust in all other creatures. They have no allies
      except themselves, only enemies. If an effect can only target allies, they
      can only use it on themselves. They resist the help of other creatures,
      attempt saving throws even when an ability is harmless (such as healing),
      and resist being touched. Enemy creatures can not move through other
      creatures&#8217; squares. Summoned and conjured creatures no longer obey
      commands. This is a mind-affecting compulsion ability.</p>

      <p>A creature within this totem gets a Will saving throw upon first
      encountering it, and an additional Will saving throw at the end of each
      turn they are affected by it until they successfully save. Even when a
      successful save is made, their allies may still treat the creature as an
      enemy if they are also within the totem and have not made a save.</p>
