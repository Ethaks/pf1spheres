      <p>You gain a fear aura that affects targets within 30 ft. of you;
      activating or deactivating this aura is a free action. All targets who are
      or come within this area must pass a Will save or become shaken for as
      long as they stay within the aura. If a creature succeeds at the saving
      throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for 24 hours.</p>
