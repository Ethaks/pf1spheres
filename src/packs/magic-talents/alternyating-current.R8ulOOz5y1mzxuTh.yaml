      <p>Your destructive blast is a shocking current of latent static
      electricity built up by cats. An alternyating current blast deals
      electricity damage. Any creature struck by the attack or that failed their
      Reflex saving throw if one was required must take a 5-foot step. Affected
      creatures may take this 5-foot step in any direction they choose. If a
      creature was forced to take a 5-foot step by this effect, they may not
      take a 5-foot step during their next turn (but may otherwise move
      normally). If an affected creature would be forced to take a 5-foot step
      by this effect and could not, they do not move and cannot take a 5-foot
      step during their next turn (such as being surrounded by difficult
      terrain).</p>
