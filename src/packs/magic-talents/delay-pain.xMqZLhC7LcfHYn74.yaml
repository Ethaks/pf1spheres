      <p>As an immediate action, when an ally or object with your natural reach
      (or within Time sphere range, if you possess the Ranged Time talent) would
      take damage or be subject to any effect, you may spend a spell point to
      delay the onset of that damage and/or effect until the end of the
      creature&#8217;s next turn (for creatures and attended objects) or the
      caster&#8217;s next turn (for unattended objects). The delayed damage
      and/or effect is incurred at this time, though it is subject to any
      changes to immunity, resistances, etc. A given effect or instance of
      damage cannot be delayed more than once. Unwilling creatures and objects
      attended by unwilling creatures require a successful touch attack and are
      allowed a Will save to negate this delay.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point as part of using this ability,
      you may partially delay ability damage, ability drain, and hit point
      damage further, causing the creature to receive half (round up) of the
      damage or drain at the end of its next turn and the remainder at the end
      of the following turn.</p>
