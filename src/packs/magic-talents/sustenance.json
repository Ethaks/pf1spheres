      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation, caster level 1st.</p>\n<p>You may spend 10 minutes to create enough bland food and drink to sustain a number of Medium-sized creatures equal to your casting ability modifier. If you possess Exquisite Detail you may create any normal assortment of food or drink using Profession (Cook) and gaining a bonus to this check equal to 1/2 your caster level. This is an instantaneous Creation effect that costs no spell points. Alternatively, you may use this ability as a standard action by spending 1 spell point.</p>\n<p>Additionally, by spending 1 spell point, you may create or alter any one object with normal size and material limitations to be edible. The object becomes nutritious enough to sustain a number of creatures based on its total size, with a Tiny-sized object being enough for a Medium creature. The object is treating as having a hardness of 0 against bite attacks, and creatures that do not have bite attacks can bite it to deal 1d3 + 1/2 Strength modifier damage to the object. Objects in this way only retain this property for a limited period of time as normal for altering objects, but any part of the object that was devoured during this time is instantaneously converted into food. If you possess Permanent Change, you may make this an instantaneous effect by spending an additional spell point.</p>\n",
