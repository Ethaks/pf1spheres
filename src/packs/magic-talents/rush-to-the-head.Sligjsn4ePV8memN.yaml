    value: >
      <p>When using a blood art that allows a Fortitude save, you may replace
      all Fortitude saves that effect allows for with Will saves.</p>

      <p>In addition, as a standard action, you rush the target&#8217;s blood to
      their head and away from their vital organs, disorienting them. On a
      failed Fortitude save, the target suffers blood loss and falls prone. If
      you spend an additional spell point when casting this effect, the target
      also becomes confused for 1 round per caster level. While confused by this
      effect, whenever the target rolls to determine behavior in a given round,
      add twice the blood loss to the result (maximum 100).</p>
