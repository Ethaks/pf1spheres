      <p>You grant the form of a humanoid creature with your shapeshift.<br>

      <strong>Limbs:</strong> 1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> Yes; <strong>Hands:</strong> Yes<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft. land speed.<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> none<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> none<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> The target can speak and gains knowledge of one
      language you also speak. If the target&#8217;s Intelligence is lower than
      6 (including 0), it is increased to 6. If the target is normally immune to
      mind-altering effects due to not possessing a mind, this negates that
      immunity.</p>

      <p>If you so choose, you may forgo applying additional traits to the
      target. Instead, you may allow the target to retain its natural attacks,
      special abilities, and movement types that were dependent on its previous
      form, in essence making the target a hybrid between a humanoid and its
      previous form.</p>

      <p>If this form is being applied to a creature that is already an
      intelligent humanoid or a creature of a similar makeup, this instead works
      as the Blank Transformation, but the creature may undergo cosmetic changes
      without costing a trait. Additionally, you may choose up to two traits
      from Blank Transformation and/or a single (transformation) or (body)
      talent that you possess that do not grant natural attacks and apply them
      to the target, as if it were part of this form. These traits are for all
      purposes not considered to be traits.</p>

      <p>Anthropomorphic Transformation offers the following traits, which you
      may apply to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Gift of Hands:</strong> Up to two limbs the target possesses
      of a single category (arms, legs, tails, etc.) now end in grasping
      fingers, which can wield weapons, perform dextrous actions, and fulfill
      somatic components for magic. If used on a pair of legs belonging to a
      quadruped, the quadruped gains the ability to walk normally on only two
      legs.</li>

      <li><strong>Gift of Mind:</strong> If the target&#8217;s Intelligence is
      lower than 6 (including -), it is increased to 6. If the target is
      normally immune to mind-altering effects due to not possessing a mind,
      this negates that immunity.</li>

      <li><strong>Gift of Speech:</strong> The target may speak and supply
      verbal spell components normally, even if in a form that would normally
      prevent this.</li>

      </ul>
