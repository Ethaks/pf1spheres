      <p>You may spend a spell point to grant the target the ability to
      immediately take a standard, move, or swift action if they choose. Any
      target who takes an action with this ability loses that action for their
      next turn. You may use this ability on yourself and only yourself as a
      swift action, or a free action if you choose to take a swift action with
      this ability. You cannot use this ability as a swift or free action in
      this manner if combining it with the Mass Time talent. A creature cannot
      benefit from Shift Time more than once per round.</p>
