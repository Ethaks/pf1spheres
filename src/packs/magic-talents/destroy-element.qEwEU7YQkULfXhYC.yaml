      <p>As a standard action you may spend a spell point to remove and
      deconstruct your elements. This requires a melee or ranged touch attack
      against a target within your geomancing range. You may use the following
      abilities depending on what packages you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Suffocation:</strong> You pull the breath from a living
      creature&#8217;s lungs. The target is allowed a Fortitude save to resist,
      and on a failure is staggered and is left unable to speak, use breath
      weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or perform any other action
      requiring breath for 1d4 rounds, +1 per 2 caster levels. If a target is
      unable to breathe for long enough, they may begin to suffocate, as
      detailed in the Gamemastery Guide.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Shatter:</strong> You may target an unattended,
      non-magical object, regardless of composition, of up to 10 lbs. per caster
      level and shatter it to pieces. This can be used to target objects
      attached to other objects (for example, a door or window), but cannot
      target a section of a larger object (for example, a portion of a stone
      wall). You may instead target a creature comprised mostly of stone or
      crystal; stone creatures suffer 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels while
      crystalline creatures suffer 1d6 damage per caster level (Fortitude
      half).</p>

      <p><strong>Fire: Ash Strike:</strong> You may generate a cone of ash that
      reaches from you to the edge of your geomancing range. This does not
      require a touch attack. This ash reveals invisible characters until they
      can wash off the ash or remove it as a full-round action (which provokes
      attacks of opportunity), and reveals the square invisible creatures are in
      if they walk on the ground, as they leave footprints in the ash. Targets
      struck by the ash strike must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded
      for 1d4 rounds, or until they wash off or remove the ash as mentioned
      above.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal: Oxidation:</strong> You destroy a metal object or
      creature. If the target&#8217;s size is one or more sizes larger than the
      size of ore that you can recover, the creature or object takes 1d8 damage
      per 2 caster levels (Fortitude half), otherwise the target takes 1d8 per
      caster level (Fortitude half). This damage overcomes any hardness the
      creature or object may have. If targeting an attended object, you must
      pass the touch attack roll and the target is allowed a Reflex save to
      negate damage. If an object receives sufficient damage to destroy it, it
      instead becomes non-functional for 1 minute per 2 caster levels, before
      returning to the broken condition with 1 hit point.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Decompose:</strong> You cause a living target&#8217;s
      flesh to rot, possibly even growing mold and mushrooms. The target suffers
      1d4 + 1 per 5 caster levels points of Constitution damage (Fortitude
      half). If a target fails their saving throw against this ability, all fast
      healing/magical healing/regeneration they gain is halved for 1 round per
      caster level (minimum 1).</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Dehydration:</strong> You suck the moisture from a
      living creature, causing it to suffer 1d6 nonlethal damage per caster
      level and become sickened for 1 round (Fortitude half). Oozes, plants, and
      creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes suffer lethal damage
      instead.</p>
