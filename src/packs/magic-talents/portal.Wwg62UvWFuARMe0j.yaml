      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Mass Teleport [mass],
      Wormhole (space)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>When using your teleport ability, you may spend an additional spell
      point to open a portal between your location and your destination. This
      portal has a maximum diameter of 5 feet per caster level and opens in the
      air somewhere adjacent to you. The portal lasts as long as you concentrate
      to a maximum of 1 round per caster level. Anything moving through one end
      of this portal arrives at the other end; it is possible to make attacks,
      flank, or perform other actions as if the two locations were adjacent. You
      may choose to open the portal without automatically going through it, if
      you so desire.</p>
