      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Dowsing (divine),
      Greater Divine [range]), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 3 spell points to divine the location of any one creature
      or object. To find a creature, you must have seen the creature or have
      some item that once belonged to it. To find an object, you must have
      touched it at least once.</p>

      <p>Discern Location has no maximum range and circumvents normal means of
      protection from scrying or other means of nondetection. Indeed, nothing
      short of a mind blank spell, the Unplottable advanced Protection talent,
      or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact
      location of the targeted individual or object. You learn the name of the
      creature or object&#8217;s location (place, name, business name, building
      name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division),
      country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies.</p>
