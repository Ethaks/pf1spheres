      <p>You gain the following abilities:</p>

      <p>As a (still) effect, the target becomes fatigued for the duration of
      your blood control. You may spend a spell point to cause the creature to
      instead become exhausted for this duration. Creatures that do not breathe
      are immune to this effect.</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) effect, you may boost the circulation of the target of
      your blood control, allowing the target to ignore one instance of the
      fatigued or staggered conditions and treat one instance of the exhausted
      condition as fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the target&#8217;s
      Constitution modifier. After a creature benefits from this ability, it
      cannot do so again for one minute per round the ability was active.
      Creatures that do not breathe do not benefit from this effect</p>

      <p>If you spend a spell point, the target may make an extra attack as part
      of a full attack or make additional attacks of opportunity (as the
      Improved Haste Time sphere talent) for the duration of this effect. This
      does not stack with similar effects such as the Improved Haste Time sphere
      talent. When used this way, the target is fatigued at the end of this
      effect. If the target was already fatigued, it is instead exhausted. If it
      was exhausted, it drops unconscious for 1d6 rounds.</p>
