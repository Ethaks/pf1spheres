      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Project Spirit
      (advanced)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When using the Project Spirit advanced Death talent, you may spend an
      additional spell point to project your spirit into the Astral Plane
      instead of the Ethereal Plane. You may bring up to 1 additional willing
      creature per 2 caster levels with you, provided these creatures are linked
      in a circle with you at the time. These fellow travelers are dependent
      upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you
      during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left
      them.</p>

      <p>While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all
      times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is
      broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.</p>

      <p>Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. Unlike a regular
      use of the Project Spirit talent, you and your companions may travel
      through the Astral Plane in this manner indefinitely, until you either
      choose to end the effect (which returns you to your body) or it is ended
      by some outside means. This effect may be dispelled like any other sphere
      effect by targeting either your astral form or your physical body.
      Dispelling this effect immediately returns you to your body.</p>
