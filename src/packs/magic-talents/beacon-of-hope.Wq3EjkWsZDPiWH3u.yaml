    value: >
      <p>When you place a glow effect on a creature, you may choose to grant
      that creature a +1 morale bonus on saves against fear. This bonus
      increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels possessed. You may spend a spell
      point to create bright light that empowers those within it. All creatures
      within the area under the effect of a fear effect are allowed a new saving
      throw at the effect&#8217;s original saving throw to end the effect, if
      one was originally given.</p>

      <p>So long as a creature is within this area of bright light, whenever
      they attempt a saving throw vs. a new fear effect, they may roll twice and
      take the better result.</p>
