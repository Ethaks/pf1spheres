      <p>You may spend a spell point as an immediate action when the target is
      subject to an attack or effect that deals hit point damage, after attack
      rolls and saving throws have been rolled but before the damage is
      determined. The attack or effect&#8217;s damage is delayed for the target
      for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). Any
      additional effects of the attack or effect, such as poison, inflicting
      bleed damage, or a saving throw against the effect, are also delayed. When
      this word ends (or immediately if this word is dispelled), the target
      immediately takes the delayed damage and incurs any additional effects of
      the delayed attack or effect, subject to any changes to immunity,
      resistances, damage reduction, etc. A given attack or effect cannot be
      delayed more than once. Abilities contingent on taking damage, such as
      redirecting damage with the Protection sphere Community talent, are
      resolved as normal when the target takes the delayed damage.</p>

      <p>An unwilling creature cannot be targeted by this word. If a creature is
      subject to this word while already under the effects of a previous Bargain
      word, the previous Bargain word ends and the creature takes the delayed
      attack or effect&#8217;s damage immediately.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Damage delayed by this word cannot be delayed
      further by the Guardian sphere&#8217;s delayed damage pool or any other
      effect which delays damage.</p>
