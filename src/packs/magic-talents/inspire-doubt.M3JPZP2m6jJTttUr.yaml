      <p>You may combine real effects and illusionary effects to effectively
      confuse targets as to which are real and which are not. Anyone who
      successfully saves against your figments takes a -1 penalty to all saving
      throws and MSD against your other non-Illusion sphere effects and
      abilities for the next minute or until they attempt a save against one of
      your non-Illusion sphere effects. This penalty increases by an additional
      one per 5 caster levels you possess.</p>
