      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Animated Shadow (advanced,
      shadow), Flowing Darkness, Shadow Lurk (shadow)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>By spending 2 spell points as a standard action you may become an area
      of blot for one minute per caster level. You gain a climb speed equal to
      the land speed and may pass through small cracks and openings as if using
      the Flowing Darkness talent. You gain a bonus to your reach equal to the
      radius of your darkness.</p>

      <p>In blot form you can manipulate objects and use your items (which also
      take on blot form) as if using the Animated Shadow talent. In this form
      you lose AC bonuses from armor and natural armor, but gain DR/- equal to
      1/2 your caster level. You cannot be tripped in blot form. Losing contact
      with a solid surface, either through your own actions or those of an ally
      or opponent, immediately ends Melt Into Shadow.</p>

      <p>You may imbue yourself with one (blot) talent at normal spell point
      cost. This talent affects all targets within the area of your reach. You
      may change your active (blot) talent as a standard action, though you must
      pay any spell point cost associated with the new talent. You may end Melt
      Into Shadow as a swift action, rematerializing in any unoccupied space
      within your reach.</p>
