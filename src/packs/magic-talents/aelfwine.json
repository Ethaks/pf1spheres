      "value": "<p>You summon a flask, gourd, stein, or wineskin filled with fairy liquor, which replenishes itself after each drink. The flask is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. If the flask is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends immediately. You may determine the quality of the brew with a Craft (alcohol) or Profession (brewer) check made as part of activating this fey-blessing, but the result has no impact on its efficacy. You may drink from it as a move action; you may allow a creature whom you are within the natural reach of to drink from it as a standard action on their turn with no action required on your part. This counts as consuming an alcoholic beverage. Choose one of the following effects when the flask is created:</p>\n<p><strong>Bolstering Brew:</strong> The imbiber gains temporary hit points equal to your caster level that last for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Brawling Booze:</strong> The imbiber gains the Barroom sphere or a (drunk) talent of your choice from that sphere for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Calming Sip:</strong> You may attempt a magic skill check against any ongoing effects with the emotion descriptor currently affecting the imbiber. If successful, that effect is suppressed for 1 round per caster level. If you spend a spell point as part of the drink (no action required), the effect is instead dispelled.</p>\n<p><strong>Liquid Courage:</strong> The imbiber gains a +2 (+1 per 7 caster levels) circumstance bonus on saves vs. fear effects for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>If the flask is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you may summon it into your possession as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You may have multiple instances of this fey-blessing active at one time; select a different effect for each. Creatures that are immune to the effects of alcohol cannot benefit from this effect.</p>\n",
