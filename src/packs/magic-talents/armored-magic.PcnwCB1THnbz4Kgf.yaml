      <p>You may create an aegis that wraps the target in protective barriers,
      granting them either a +3 armor bonus or a +1 shield bonus to AC (your
      choice). This does not stack with other armor or shield bonuses, but does
      apply against attacks made by incorporeal creatures. These bonuses
      increase by +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess.</p>
