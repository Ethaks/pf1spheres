      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere (Break Enchantment, Restore
      Senses (cure), Restore Spirit (cure)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point when restoring soul to remove
      one permanent negative level from the target in addition to the other
      effects. At caster level 15th, this removes all negative levels and
      spending an additional spell point also allows restoring soul to count as
      using a miracle or wish spell for those spells and abilities that specify
      they can only be removed by the use of these spells. This does not mimic
      any other benefits of a miracle or wish spell.</p>

      <p>Additionally, they are healed of all broken bones, severed body parts
      (fingers, toes, hands, feet, arms, legs, tails, or even heads of
      multi-headed creatures), and ruined organs. This also restores sight,
      hearing, and other permanent loss of senses. If body parts to be
      reattached are not present, they require 2d10 rounds to regrow.</p>

      <p>This cannot bring a creature back from the dead nor function on a
      creature that is already dead.</p>
