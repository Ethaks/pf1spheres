      "value": "<p>You cannot change the direction of the wind, but you may overpower it. If you wish to change the direction of the wind, you must create a new wind of the direction you desire. If the wind is the same severity as the natural wind, the winds negate (if they oppose) or join to create a wind with a direction halfway between the two. If one wind is smaller than the other, the smaller wind is negated in favor of the stronger one.</p>\n<p><strong>Light Wind:</strong> A gentle breeze, having little or no game effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate Wind:</strong> A steady wind with a 50% chance of extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles.</p>\n<p><strong>Strong Wind:</strong> Gusts that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and the like). Such gusts impose a &#8211;2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on Perception checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe Wind:</strong> In addition to automatically extinguishing any unprotected flames, winds of this magnitude cause protected flames (such as those of lanterns) to dance wildly and have a 50% chance of extinguishing these lights. Ranged weapon attacks and Perception checks are at a &#8211;4 penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Windstorm:</strong> Powerful enough to bring down branches if not whole trees, windstorms automatically extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames, such as those of lanterns. Ranged weapon attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons have a &#8211;4 penalty on attack rolls. Perception checks that rely on sound are at a &#8211;8 penalty due to the howling of the wind.</p>\n<p><strong>Hurricane-Force Wind:</strong> All flames are extinguished. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with siege weapons, which have a &#8211;8 penalty on attack rolls). Perception checks based on sound are impossible: all characters can hear is the roaring of the wind. Hurricane-force winds often fell trees.</p>\n<p><strong>Tornado:</strong> All flames are extinguished. All ranged attacks are impossible (even with siege weapons), as are sound-based Perception checks. While natural winds of severity level 7 can result in a tornado, magically-altered winds of severity level 7 affects too small of an area to create this phenomenon. (Instead of being blown away [see Table: Wind], characters in close proximity to a tornado who fail their Fortitude saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who come in contact with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 points of damage per round, before being violently expelled (falling damage might apply). While a tornado&#8217;s rotational speed can be as great as 300 mph, the funnel itself moves forward at an average of 30 mph [roughly 250 feet per round]. A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes similar forms of major destruction.)</p>\n<strong>Table: Wind</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Severity Level</th>\n<th>Wind Speed</th>\n<th>Ranged Attacks Normal/Siege Weapons^</th>\n<th>Checked Size^^</th>\n<th>Blown Away Size^^^</th>\n<th>Fly Penalty</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (light)</td>\n<td>0&#8211;10 mph</td>\n<td>&#8212;/&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2 (moderate)</td>\n<td>11&#8211;20 mph</td>\n<td>&#8212;/&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 (strong)</td>\n<td>21&#8211;30 mph</td>\n<td>&#8211;2/&#8212;</td>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8211;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 (severe)</td>\n<td>31&#8211;50 mph</td>\n<td>&#8211;4/&#8212;</td>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>&#8211;4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 (windstorm)</td>\n<td>51&#8211;74 mph</td>\n<td>Impossible/&#8211;4</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>&#8211;8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6 (hurricane)</td>\n<td>75&#8211;174 mph</td>\n<td>Impossible/&#8211;8</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>&#8211;12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 (tornado)</td>\n<td>175&#8211;300 mph</td>\n<td>Impossible/impossible</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>&#8211;16</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>^ The siege weapon category includes ballista and catapult attacks as well as boulders tossed by giants.<br>\n^^ <strong>Checked Size:</strong> Creatures of this size or smaller are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed on a DC 10 Strength check (if on the ground) or a DC 20 Fly check if airborne.<br>\n^^^ <strong>Blown Away Size:</strong> Creatures on the ground are knocked prone and rolled 1d4 &#215; 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet, unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check. Flying creatures are blown back 2d6 &#215; 10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting, unless they succeed at a DC 25 Fly check.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Wind Effects</strong><br>\n<strong>Duststorm:</strong> When severity level 4 winds are created in a desert, it can create a duststorm, blowing fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). At severity level 5, a duststorm deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also poses a choking hazard (see Drowning, except that a character with a scarf or similar protection across her mouth and nose does not begin to choke until after a number of rounds equal to 10 + her Constitution score).</p>\n",
