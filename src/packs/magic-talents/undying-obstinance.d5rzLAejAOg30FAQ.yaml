      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, Life sphere, caster level
      15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a consecration filled with
      positive energy that sustains the living beyond what their bodies can
      withstand. While this consecration is in effect, no living creature
      becomes disabled or dying within its area, nor do creatures die from loss
      of hit points. This does not protect creatures from these effects once
      this consecration ends or they leave the area, nor does it protect them
      from death from other causes. This counts as a Life talent for the purpose
      of talents, drawbacks, or other abilities that change who you can affect
      with Life talents or abilities.</p>

      <p>You must concentrate to maintain this consecration, but you may spend
      an additional spell point as a free action to allow this effect to
      continue for 1 round per two caster levels without concentration.</p>
