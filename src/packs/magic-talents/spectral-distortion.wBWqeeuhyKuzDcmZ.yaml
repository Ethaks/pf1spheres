      <p>You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that disrupts the
      bonds between layered planes. An incorporeal creature hit by this ghost
      strike must succeed a Will saving throw or be considered corporeal for a
      number of rounds equal to your caster level (minimum 1). The creature can
      attempt another saving throw at the end of their turn to dismiss this
      effect.</p>
