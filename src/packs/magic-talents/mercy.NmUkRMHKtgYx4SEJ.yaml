      <p>You may spend a spell point to reduce the target&#8217;s ability to
      deal lethal damage. The target is allowed a Will save, and on a failure,
      deals nonlethal damage with all of its weapon attacks for 1 round per
      caster level. Damage taken by creatures or objects that are not subject to
      nonlethal damage is not converted to nonlethal and remains lethal
      damage.</p>
