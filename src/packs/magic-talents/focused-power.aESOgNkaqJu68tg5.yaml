      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere (Powerful
      Telekinesis), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point you can further advance the strength of your
      telekinesis. Increase the maximum sized object you can affect with
      telekinesis by 1 size category. This effect stacks with the benefits of
      Powerful Telekinesis. However, the action required to concentrate on the
      effect is increased by one step, and you may not spend a spell point to
      maintain it with Sustained Force.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point to increase your capacity by
      another size, but doing so demands all of your mental focus. You may only
      use the basic capability of telekinesis to move objects, and cannot use
      this in conjunction with Hostile Lift or Bludgeon.</p>
