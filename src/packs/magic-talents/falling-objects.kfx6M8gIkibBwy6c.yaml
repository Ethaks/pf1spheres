      <p>Objects that fall upon characters deal falling damage based on their
      size according to Table: Object Size.</p>

      <p>Objects made of stone or harder substances deal double falling damage,
      while soft object such as cloth deal half falling damage. An object
      falling less than 30 feet also deals half falling damage, while an object
      falling more than 150 feet deals double falling damage. These multipliers
      stack; a stone object falling 150 feet would deal x4 damage, while a cloth
      object falling 20 feet would deal 1/4th damage. A falling object takes the
      same amount of falling damage as it deals, and no falling object can deal
      more than 20d6 falling damage. Additional damage, such as through
      enhancements, acid coatings, etc., is not multiplied or divided by
      hardness or falling distance.</p>

      <p>Dropping an object on a creature is considered an attack with a ranged
      weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. This distance is measured from
      the object&#8217;s starting point to the target&#8217;s square, rather
      than the distance between you and the target. When making an attack roll
      with a falling object, use your Intelligence instead of your Dexterity
      when calculating your attack bonus.</p>

      <p>When dropping an object on a target that is larger than the dropped
      object, make an attack roll against their AC. This is similar to a weapon
      attack. When dropping an object that is the same size or larger than the
      target, make an attack roll against their touch AC. This is similar to
      using an indirect-fire siege weapon, and carries some additional
      rules:</p>

      <p>When using a Large or larger object like an indirect-fire siege weapon,
      the object targets a creature in a square, but also deals half its falling
      damage as splash damage to additional creatures within 5 feet + 5 feet per
      size category above Large of the object being dropped.</p>

      <p>When using a dropped object of Medium size or larger like an
      indirect-fire siege engine, you may target a grid intersection instead of
      a creature like you can with a splash weapon, in which case direct damage
      is not dealt and splash damage (if any) affects creatures as normal. Also,
      like a splash weapon, if you miss with a dropped object, the object veers
      off course one space per range increment. Roll a d8 to determine the
      direction in which the object veered off-course, just as with a splash
      weapon.</p>

      <p>A dropped, hard, non-wall/covering object larger than the creatures
      underneath it will push creatures out of the area where it fell to the
      nearest unoccupied spaces, while objects the same size or smaller would
      themselves move to the nearest unoccupied spaces. Walls and coverings
      larger than the objects underneath them function as catches, described
      below.</p>

      <p>A dropped soft non-covering object, such as a large bundle of cloth,
      that is larger than the creatures underneath it neither moves creatures
      nor becomes a catch, and instead forces the targets to pass a Reflex save
      or be knocked prone and buried underneath the object itself.</p>
