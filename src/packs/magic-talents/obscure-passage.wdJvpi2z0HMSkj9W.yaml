    value: >
      <p>By spending a spell point, you modify your blot to serve as a portal
      through a surface, passing through up to 5 feet of material per caster
      level. Multiple castings can penetrate deeper into a surface, and
      creatures can move through both openings. Obscure Passage can not
      penetrate a surface with a hardness greater than 5 plus its caster level.
      Attempting to create an obscure passage through a surface that is too
      thick or too hard causes the spell to fail and all spell points spent to
      be lost. An obscure passage has a maximum diameter of 1 foot per caster
      level, and leaves the surface whole and unmarred when it expires. Light
      does not pass through an obscure passage, nor do low-light vision or
      darkvision allow a creature to peer through it, though the Clearsight meld
      and see in darkness do.</p>

      <p>A creature standing above an obscure passage as it opens may attempt a
      Reflex save to avoid falling in.</p>
