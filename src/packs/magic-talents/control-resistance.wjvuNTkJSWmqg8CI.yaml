      <p>As a manabond, you can create a connection that attempts to bolster or
      reduce a creature&#8217;s spell resistance for as long as your manabond
      holds. If the recipient of this manabond has spell resistance, you can
      reduce or raise it by an amount equal to 2, +1 per two caster levels. If
      the recipient does not have spell resistance, you can spend a spell point
      to grant them spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level for as long
      as the manabond holds.</p>
