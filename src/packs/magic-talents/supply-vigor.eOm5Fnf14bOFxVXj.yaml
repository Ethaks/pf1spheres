      <p>You may enhance creatures, allowing them to ignore 2 points of ability
      damage, drain, or penalty they have suffered to one of their ability
      scores (chosen when using this talent), and reducing any such damage or
      drain they would suffer during the duration by half this amount. This
      reduction does not affect any ability damage or drain taken as part of a
      cost. This increases by 2 points per 7 caster levels. If you possess
      Physical Enhancement or Mental Enhancement, the benefits of this talent
      are supplied to any ability score enhanced with those talents at no extra
      cost.</p>
