      <p>As a move action, you may summon one masterwork musical instrument, be
      it percussion, string, or wind, of a size no greater than 1 size smaller
      than your own size. The instrument is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5
      hit points per caster level.</p>

      <p>If the instrument is not in your possession at the start of your turn,
      you may summon it into your possession as a move action as long as you
      have line of sight to it. You can never have more than one such instrument
      summoned at one time.</p>

      <p>Starting a song requires a standard action and maintaining one requires
      a move action. Starting a new song ends any previous songs. A creature can
      only be under the effects of one song at a time; should a creature
      affected by one be subjected to another, the caster (not necessarily the
      performer, if using the Share Link talent) of the second effect must
      attempt a magic skill check against the MSD of the existing effect&#8217;s
      caster. All options are sonic mind-affecting effects with medium range
      unless noted.</p>

      <p>You may perform, singing or playing (either on the summoned instrument
      or another that you possess) the songs listed below.</p>

      <p><strong>Bewitching Melody:</strong> You may perform a haunting melody
      that opens the minds of those who hear it to outside influence, inflicting
      a -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster
      levels thereafter) against charm effects on all hostile creatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Dancing Tune:</strong> You play a bouncy jig that compels any
      creature within close range to dance and caper. A creature can resist by
      attempting a Will save. Creatures that fail are compelled to dance and
      shuffle their feet, and are effectively staggered as long as you continue
      to play. Once a creature succeeds at the save against this song, it is
      immune to further instances originating from you for 24 hours. This is a
      compulsion effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Distracting Cacophony:</strong> You may fill the air with
      discordant notes, granting all creatures within medium range a +2 (+1 per
      7 caster levels) bonus on saves against sonic effects, but imposing an
      equal penalty on hearing-based Perception checks and concentration checks.
      The penalty portion of this ability is not a mind-affecting effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Lullaby:</strong> You may play a peaceful lullaby to inflict a
      -2 penalty (increasing by 1 at 7th caster level and every 7 caster levels
      thereafter) against effects that cause sleep or the staggered condition on
      all hostile creatures.</p>

      <p>Performing one of these songs will occupy limbs and voice appropriate
      to the instrument (if any) such that they cannot be used to for other
      performances (such as bardic music) at the same time.</p>
