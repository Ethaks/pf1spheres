      <p>You may place this word on a creature, who then designates a victim
      within range that is entitled to a Will save to negate the effect. This is
      a curse effect only on the victim, while it is harmless to the attacker.
      Once per round when the attacker deals damage to or succeeds on a combat
      maneuver check against the victim the attacker gains a +1 bonus on attack
      rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to
      your casting ability modifier. This bonus increases by +1 for every 10
      caster levels. Multiple bonuses from a single instance of this word stack
      with each other, up to your casting ability modifier, but not from other
      instances of the same word.</p>

      <p>Only direct damage gives the attacker this bonus; ongoing damage such
      as from acid arrow does not. As a swift action the attacker may change
      victims; this resets the bonus, and if the new victim succeeds on their
      Will save the effect ends.</p>

      <p>You may choose to instead place this word on a single creature, in
      which case it gains the bonus once per round when any other creature deals
      damage to or succeeds on a combat maneuver check against them.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend
      a spell point to allow the effect to endure for 1 minute per caster level
      without concentration.</p>
