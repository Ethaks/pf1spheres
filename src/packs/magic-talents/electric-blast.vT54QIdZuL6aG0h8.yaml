      <p>You may change the damage type of your destructive blast from
      bludgeoning to electricity. Targets wearing metal armor or primarily
      comprised of metal suffer a -3 penalty to AC and to saving throws against
      an electric blast. An electric blast can ignite combustibles, and melt
      metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or
      bronze.</p>
