      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere (Natural Aspect
      (form) (fast healing option)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Your companion&#8217;s fast healing becomes regeneration instead. Your
      companion is not dismissed if reduced to or below 0 hit points, nor are
      effects that trigger when the companion is reduced to 0 hit points (such
      as Explosive Companion) triggered, unless this regeneration is
      suppressed.</p>

      <p>This regeneration is overcome by two of the following damage types of
      your choice: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, negative energy,
      piercing, positive energy, or slashing. You cannot select a damage type
      that your companion possesses resistance or immunity to from a permanent
      ability, such as a (form) or (type) talent.</p>

      <p>Should your companion later gain resistance or immunity to the selected
      damage type from a permanent ability, you must select a new damage
      type.</p>
