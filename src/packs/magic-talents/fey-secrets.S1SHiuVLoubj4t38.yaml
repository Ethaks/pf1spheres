      <p>You gain an attunement to nature, which gives you insight into the
      world around you. Once before the end of the fey-link, you may gain an
      insight bonus to a single skill check, ability check, attack roll, saving
      throw, combat maneuver check, or initiative roll equal to 1d4 + 1 per 5
      caster levels you possess. You may gain this fey-blessing multiple times,
      gaining one use of this ability per fey-blessing. You cannot use this
      fey-blessing multiple times for the same roll.</p>
