    value: >
      <p>You may manipulate your magical essence, and grant others access to
      your own magical knowledge. By spending a spell point and targeting a
      creature, you may choose a single talent you possess that the target does
      not, or a single base sphere that you possess that the target does
      not.</p>

      <p>The target may use this talent or base sphere ability once, using your
      caster level at the time this ability is cast (not including temporary
      bonuses or bonuses gained from items) and related sphere-specific
      drawbacks. They must use this ability within an hour per caster level,
      otherwise the ability is wasted. They must pay any spell point costs as
      normal. If you attempt to grant a talent to a target that already knows
      that talent, this effect fails and any spell points spent are wasted.</p>
