      <p>For the duration of the fey-link, you gain an uncanny ability to meddle
      with the possessions of other creatures. You may perform the Steal combat
      maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity and may use your ranks
      in the Sleight of Hand skill in place of your base attack bonus when
      determining your combat maneuver check for the Steal combat maneuver. Any
      time you attempt a Sleight of Hand check or Steal combat maneuver against
      a creature within your natural reach, you may also rearrange its
      possessions.</p>

      <p>The next time that creature attempts to produce a weapon or item it
      finds its possessions misplaced or disarranged, thus requiring a standard
      action to retrieve a stored item or draw a weapon (unless you have stolen
      the item in question). After spending this standard action, the creature
      takes mental inventory and is no longer affected by this ability. You may
      choose to replace items you have stolen with worthless material (twigs,
      sand, etc.) that you have in your possession (but not something that has
      an effect like a primed grenade or cursed object) with an equal or lesser
      weight to the stolen object. This does not increase the difficulty of your
      Sleight of Hand checks.</p>
