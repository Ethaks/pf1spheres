      <p>You may spend a spell point to gain a sense that allows you to decipher
      all magical writings, such as those found in books, scrolls, on weapons,
      or in other places intelligible to you. This does not invoke the magic
      contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or
      trapped scroll. Furthermore, once you have read a magical inscription
      through this ability, you are thereafter able to read that particular
      writing even without this sense. You can read at the rate of one page (250
      words) per minute. You can identify glyphs, runes, and symbol spells with
      a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + 1/2 caster level).</p>

      <h3 id="toc26"><span>Divination Talent Types</span></h3>

      <p>Some talents are marked (divine). These grant you different things you
      may divine for in place of magic.</p>

      <p>Some talents are marked (sense). These talents grant you additional
      senses you may grant.</p>
