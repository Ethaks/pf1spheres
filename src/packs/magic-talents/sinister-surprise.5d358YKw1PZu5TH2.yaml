      <p>When spending a spell point to create an area of darkness or blot that
      persists without concentration, you may opt to create a darkness or blot
      effect that remains dormant until triggered by a creature entering the
      10-foot square area at the center of your dormant darkness or blot
      effect.</p>

      <p>A sinister surprise can be spotted and disabled as a magical trap, with
      a Perception DC and Disable Device DC equal to the effect&#8217;s save DC.
      You may also trigger the sinister surprise as an immediate action as long
      as it is within medium range. You may have multiple sinister surprises
      active, but their trigger areas may not overlap. An untriggered sinister
      surprise persists for 10 minutes per caster level or until disabled or
      dismissed. A triggered sinister surprise has the duration of a typical
      area of darkness or blot.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a second time to add extra conditions to the
      trigger of your sinister surprise. You may trigger it yourself from up to
      long range as an immediate action. Additionally, you may choose any of the
      following additional conditions: You may allow a number of specific
      individuals up to your caster level, designated at the time of the
      casting, to pass through the sinister surprise without setting it off. You
      may set it to be triggered only by a certain creature type or specific
      individual with whom you are familiar. You may set your sinister surprise
      to go off at a specified time within the effect&#8217;s duration.</p>
