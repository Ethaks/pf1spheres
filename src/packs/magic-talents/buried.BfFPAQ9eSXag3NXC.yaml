    value: >
      <p>When a target is buried in material, such as from large cloth objects
      as mentioned above, they suffer 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute
      while buried, which becomes lethal damage when their nonlethal damage
      equals their hit points. A creature may clear material equal to five times
      their heavy load limit per minute, or per 30 seconds if using an
      appropriate tool such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel. The amount of stone
      or heavier material that fills a 5-foot-by-5-foot area weighs about 1 ton
      (2,000 pounds), with wood and softer materials such as cloth weight half
      that amount. A buried character cannot unbury itself, but may attempt to
      free itself with a Strength check or Escape Artist check against a DC
      equal to 5 + the Reflex save DC they failed that buried them.</p>
