    value: >
      <p>You can telepathically order and communicate with undead creatures you
      control within your dominion range. You do not need line of sight or
      effect to maintain this connection. Only targets completely under your
      control are valid; charmed undead are not truly under your control, and as
      such do not qualify.</p>

      <p>Giving basic commands to an undead is a free action, but your increased
      control allows you to master complex commands for your undead as well.
      Choose any 2 tricks + 1 per 5 caster levels that can be taught to an
      animal or the pose as scenery trick (see the Handle Animal skill).
      Mindless undead you control are able to perform these tricks when ordered
      to as a move action. This does not allow you to train undead for a
      purpose, &#8220;push&#8221; an undead to perform a task it normally would
      not be able to, or accomplish other effects of the Handle Animal
      skill.</p>

      <p>Additionally, so long as an undead you control is within your dominion
      range, you may, as a full-round action, concentrate on that undead to
      perceive that creature&#8217;s surroundings as if you were standing where
      that creature was. While you may use the creature&#8217;s special sense
      (i.e., darkvision, etc.), you must use your own Perception skill if
      attempting a check.</p>

      <p>You can select this talent multiple times; each time you do after the
      first, increase the number of tricks your undead can perform by 3.</p>
