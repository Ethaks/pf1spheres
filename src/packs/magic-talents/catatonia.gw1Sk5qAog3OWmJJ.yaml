      <p>You wrap the weary kittens in a soft and warm blanket so they might
      drift off to sleep.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Powerful Charm, Sleep
      (charm)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use the Sleep (charm) powerful charm, you may spend an
      additional spell point. If you do, the duration of this (charm) effect
      becomes permanent. Whenever the sleeping target would receive a new Will
      saving throw to wake up, they roll twice on their saving throw, taking the
      worse result. A target put to sleep this way does not receive a +4 on
      their saving throw to wake up.</p>

      <p>If your permanent Mind sphere caster level is 15th or higher, a
      creature who fails their saving throw against a Sleep (charm) powerful
      charm modified with this advanced talent may only receive a single new
      Will saving throw to wake up every 24 hours (such as through an attempt to
      rouse or from taking damage).</p>
