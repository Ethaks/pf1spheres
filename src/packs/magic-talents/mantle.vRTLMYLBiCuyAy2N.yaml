    value: >
      <p>When you gain your first (mantle) talent, you gain the ability, as a
      standard action, to touch a creature and spend a spell point, bestowing
      your mantle upon it. Unwilling targets may attempt a Will save to resist a
      mantle being placed on them. A mantle lasts for one hour per caster level,
      and is subject to spell resistance.</p>

      <p>Having a mantle grants different effects depending on the current
      weather conditions. Talents marked with the (mantle) tag add effects to
      your mantle; once you have bestowed your mantle upon a creature they gain
      the benefits of all (mantle) talents you have that apply to the weather in
      its area. Abilities and effects that reduces the severity of weather (such
      as the Weather incanter specialization or Clear Skies mantle) do not
      reduce the effect of mantles.</p>
