      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Intuit Knowledge
      (cognition)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>When you attempt an ability or skill check to gain information (such as
      a Knowledge check, Profession checks to answer questions, or Diplomacy
      checks to gather information) you may spend a spell point to bend your
      entire mind to the task. The GM then determines the success or failure of
      the roll secretly. If the check is successful, for each five caster levels
      you possess you learn an additional detail or piece of related information
      (such as additional rumors about a city or the casting tradition of a
      magical effect you have identified).</p>

      <p>On a failed check you still learn the information a basic success would
      have revealed. However, the GM may then remove a single detail from the
      information gained or reveal a piece of false information alongside true
      information (such as revealing a real ability of a monster and a fake
      vulnerability during a monster lore check, or telling a player all the
      rules of etiquette for a situation except for one).</p>
