    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that saps a creature
      of its energy (Will negates). On a failed save, the subject is fatigued
      and takes nonlethal damage equal to 1d8 per caster level. This is
      considered starvation damage, and as such the fatigue and nonlethal damage
      cannot be healed, even by magic, until the target consumes some sort of
      food (a standard action, assuming the food is on hand and need not be dug
      out of a backpack first). If no food is available, the target begins to
      attempt Constitution checks per day as normal for starvation.</p>

      <p>Multiple applications of hunger do not stack; only the highest
      nonlethal damage applies.</p>
