      "value": "<p>As an illusion, you may create glamers that suppress and eliminate sensation rather than creating their own. Suppressions cannot be negated or disbelieved through a Will save. You may suppress any sense that you can affect when creating illusions, but each such Suppression is considered a separate glamer.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> If you suppress every sense required to fool a complex or exotic sense, that sense cannot automatically detect that creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Invisibility:</strong> When suppressing vision, you allow the target to attempt Stealth checks to hide even while being observed. This does not grant the invisible condition, but counts as invisibility for effects that interact with it (such as spells that negate it), and therefore does not stack with the invisibility spell or other, similar effects. The target also gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks per caster level (maximum 20). Objects cannot attempt Stealth checks, but become difficult to see, requiring a Perception check to find with a DC equal to 10 + their size bonus + your caster level. If you are undetected by a creature, you gain total concealment against it, as well as a +2 bonus to attack rolls against it, and you may ignore its Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<p><strong>Silence:</strong> When suppressing sound, you cause the creature to become muffled. The target loses its armor check penalty to Stealth and reduces the penalty associated with sniping by 1 per caster level (minimum 0). However, the target also suffers a 5% chance of arcane spell failure per caster level (maximum 100%) when using magic that requires verbal components or is language-based.</p>\n<p><strong>Touchless:</strong> When suppressing touch, it becomes difficult to detect the target by feel. If the target touches or makes a melee attack against a creature from Stealth, that creature must succeed at a Perception check to even feel that they have been touched or attacked (DC 10 + 1 per caster level, -1 per point of damage dealt). The target also gains a +1 circumstance bonus per caster level (maximum +20) to Sleight of Hand checks made to pick pockets.</p>\n<p><strong>Odorless:</strong> When suppressing taste and smell, the affected target inflicts other creatures attempting to track it or discover it through smell (such as with the scent special ability) a penalty to their Perception or Survival checks equal to -1 per caster level (maximum 20). This also applies to checks made to detect poison or identify the target via smell or taste. Additionally, if the target attempts to use smell to affect other targets (such as making them sickened or nauseated through the stench ability), targets gain a +1 bonus per caster level (maximum 20) to their saving throws.</p>\n<p>Suppressing magical auras is described in the Manipulate Aura talent, and is assumed to be used on all magical auras (including the aura from the Suppression itself) affecting the glamered creature.</p>\n<p>You may spend an additional spell point to create a figment that suppresses sensations just like the glamer. All targets inside the figment gain the above benefits and penalties, as if they were under the effects of the glamer. You may choose if this applies only to creatures or to all creatures and objects. Unlike other figments, a Suppression figment cannot move once placed, and has no sensory expression other than the noticeable blurring of sensation inside its area.</p>\n",
