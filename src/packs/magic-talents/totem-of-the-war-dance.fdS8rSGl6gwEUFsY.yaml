    value: >
      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a totem of the war dance. You
      and your allies may use your move actions to allow other allies to move.
      The giving character cannot move (or take a 5-feet step), while the
      receiving ally gets another move action to spend. This extra move action
      must be used immediately and can only be used with a movement ability.
      They may not leave the area of the totem during this move. Their actions
      provoke attacks of opportunity normally. No single ally can be moved by
      more than 2 allies until their next turn has occurred. Any ally may swap
      places with an adjacent ally as a move action. This does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. Both allies must be capable of moving for this to
      work.</p>
