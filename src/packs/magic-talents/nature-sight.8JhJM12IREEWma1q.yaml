    value: >
      <p>You may gain a supernatural sense depending on what Nature packages you
      possess for as long as you concentrate, or you may spend a spell point to
      gain the sense for 1 minute per caster level. This sense has a range equal
      to your geomancing range. Each sense must be gained as a separate
      effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Cloudsight (Su):</strong> You gain mistsight, except
      allowing you to only see through clouds of fog, mist, and smoke as if they
      were transparent. In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from
      concealment or total concealment against creatures that are flying or have
      the air subtype provided they are within range of your cloudsight.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Earthsight (Su):</strong> You gain tremorsense, only
      allowing you to detect anything in contact with the same body of ground as
      you. In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment or total
      concealment against creatures that are underground or have the earth
      subtype provided they are within range of your earthsight.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire: Firesight (Su):</strong> You can see through flames,
      lava, and smoke as if they were transparent. In addition, you do not
      suffer miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures
      that are on fire or have the fire subtype provided they are within range
      of your firesight.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal: Metalsight (Su):</strong> You gain the scent ability,
      except only allowing you to detect metal objects (including creatures
      wearing or carrying metal objects). In addition, you do not suffer miss
      chance from concealment or total concealment against ferrous creatures or
      creatures that have the clockwork or robot subtypes provided they are
      within range of your metalsight.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Plantsight (Su):</strong> You gain greensight, except
      only allowing you to see through leaves, living wood, greenery,
      undergrowth, and vines as if they were transparent (you still cannot see
      through dead wood). In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from
      concealment or total concealment against creatures that are entangled in
      plantlife or of the plant creature type provided they are within range of
      your greensight.</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Watersense (Su):</strong> You gain tremorsense, except
      only allowing you to detect anything in contact with the same body of
      water as you. In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment
      or total concealment against creatures that are underwater or have the
      water subtype provided they are within range of your watersense.</p>
