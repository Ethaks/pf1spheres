      <p>When using your Destroy alter ability, you may target the moving
      components of a lock in lieu of targeting the whole lock, allowing you to
      disable it without destroying the entire device. When attempting to
      disable a complex device or lock you may attempt Disable Device checks as
      if it was a class skill using your caster level in place of skill ranks
      and your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity. Doing so requires
      a standard action, regardless of how long a typical Disable Device check
      would take. If you possess Potent Alteration you may spend a spell point
      to disarm magical traps.</p>
