You may use this on a deceased creature to determine how they died, so long as the target has been dead for no more than one day per caster level.</p>\n<p>You may also use this ability on any ally that is currently under the effect of one of your Life sphere abilities regardless of range or line of effect (such as allies who currently possess temporary hit points from your invigorate ability), as long as they are on the same plane of existence. You always know the direction and distance to your ally.</p>\n",
