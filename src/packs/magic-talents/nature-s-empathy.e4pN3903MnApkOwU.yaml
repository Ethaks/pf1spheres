      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Vermin Empathy:</strong> You gain wild empathy as the druid
      class feature (and treating your caster levels as druid levels for this
      purpose), but only affecting creatures of the vermin type and bypassing
      the immunity to mind-affecting effects granted by the vermin type. This
      ability treats swarms of the vermin type as if they were one creature
      possessing a single mind.</p>

      <p><strong>Wild Empathy:</strong> You gain wild empathy as the druid class
      feature, treating your caster levels as druid levels for this purpose.
      This ability treats swarms of the animal type as if they were one creature
      possessing a single mind.</p>
