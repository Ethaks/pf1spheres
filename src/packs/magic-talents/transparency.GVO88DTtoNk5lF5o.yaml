      <p>You may convert any material into a more transparent version of itself
      as long as you concentrate for up to 1 minute per caster level, but you
      may always spend a spell point to allow the effect to remain without
      concentration for its maximum duration.</p>

      <p>This does not affect the object&#8217;s composition, hardness, or have
      any effect other than offer a clear view through the object. The object
      may be of any size of which you can create or, if larger, may be as large
      as a two square feet per caster level that can penetrate up to 1 foot of
      material per caster level.</p>

      <p>You may choose to affect the object&#8217;s opacity in a way that
      allows peering through an object while remaining unobserved from the other
      side. When used in this way, Perception checks through the object suffer a
      -4 penalty, but it requires a DC 15 Perception check to notice that the
      object is see-through from the other side. If you possess Exquisite
      Detail, the penalty to Perception decreases to -2 and the Perception DC to
      notice that the object is transparent increases by your caster level. If
      you possess Lengthened Creation you may use it to extend the duration as
      normal. You may affect a created object with transparency with the same
      action used to create the object.</p>
