      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Wind and
      Precipitation of severity level 4 or higher, whenever they strike an enemy
      with a melee weapon that is primarily made of metal or which has a metal
      striking surface (like most polearms and maces), the enemy is struck by a
      small lightning bolt dealing 2d4 electricity damage, +1d4 damage per each
      category above storm. In addition, any creature bearing your mantle gains
      a dodge bonus to Reflex saves against lightning strikes equal to your
      casting ability modifier.</p>
