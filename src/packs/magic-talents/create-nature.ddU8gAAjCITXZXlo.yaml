      <p>As an instantaneous effect, you may spend a spell point to create your
      geomancing element anywhere within range. While this is its own geomancing
      ability, it may also be combined with another geomancing ability as part
      of the same action, in which case the second geomancing ability comes into
      effect immediately, using the created element to meet the second
      ability&#8217;s prerequisites. You must pay any costs associated with both
      abilities to combine them in this manner.</p>

      <p>Create Nature counts as a geomancing ability or effect belonging to the
      package being used.</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Create Air:</strong> You create a cloud of air. This
      creates one 5-foot cube per 2 caster levels (minimum 1 cube) of breathable
      air. The created cloud of air will immediately displace other gases,
      liquids, and vapors in the area, but will shortly thereafter behave as
      normal air. For example, if this talent is used underwater, the created
      air cloud will form a bubble that will begin to ascend to the surface.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Granulate:</strong> You create enough loose dirt or sand
      to cover a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area. You may reduce
      the spell point cost by 1 (minimum 0 spell points) if you choose to break
      apart rock and stone within this area (reducing their thickness by 1 inch,
      +1 inch per 5 caster levels), instead of creating the dirt or sand
      spontaneously.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Collapsing
      Structures</strong></span><br>

      Generally speaking, single castings of Create Nature (earth) on stone
      structures will not be enough to compromise the structural integrity of a
      building. Should half of the structure's load bearing columns, keystones,
      or walls be reduced to half thickness or less, a weakened area is created.
      Those who notice the weakened area (with a successful DC 20 Craft
      (stonemasonry) or Knowledge (engineering) check) may exacerbate the
      situation by destroying half of the structure's load-bearing objects,
      triggering a cave-in or collapse. Rules for the cave-in and collapse
      hazard can be found in the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire:</strong> While the (fire) package already has the power
      to Create Fire, you may now combine Create Fire with another geomancing
      ability, as outlined above. This can include using Affect Fire and Create
      Fire at the same time to create truly powerful fires. Unlike the uses
      listed above, you do not need to spend a spell point to combine Create
      Fire and other geomancing abilities as part of the same action.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal:</strong> You may now use Recover Ore in conjunction with
      other geomancing abilities, as outlined above, though doing so increases
      the cost of Recover Ore to 2 spell points instead of 1.</p>

      <p><em>Hemoglobin:</em> You may create metal ore out of a living
      creature&#8217;s essence. Target a living corporeal creature within your
      geomancing range. To use hemoglobin, make a ranged touch attack against
      the target, inflicting 1d2 Constitution damage to the target (Fortitude
      save for half damage). The die size of the Constitution damage increases
      by 1 step for every 5 caster levels (1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.). Regardless of
      the creature&#8217;s size or bodily composition, you Recover Ore of Fine
      size upon successfully hitting the target. While the name of this ability
      suggests the target must bleed or have blood, it is not necessary; the
      only requirement is that the creature be corporeal and living. If the
      target is immune to ability damage, you still Recover Ore of Fine
      size.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Grow Plants:</strong> You spontaneously grow plants.
      This may create one tree (to a maximum size equal to that which you can
      control through the Pummel geomancing ability) or a field of plants within
      a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area. This may create basic
      plants (corn, underbrush, ivy) and may be combined with Harvest to create
      edible food, but cannot create plants with inherent qualities (i.e., you
      cannot create rare herbs, etc.).</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Create Water:</strong> You create a pool of water. You
      create one 5-foot cube per 2 caster levels (minimum 1 cube) of clean
      water. Using this ability in conjunction with Vortex can create a vortex
      that travels on land, so long as it is always touching the ground. Using
      this ability in conjunction with Freeze can allow you to create walls of
      ice by freezing vertical spaces as you would normally do horizontal
      spaces. These walls cover the same area and have the same hit points as
      usual, but may be arranged in a contiguous wall no more than 5 feet high
      per inch of thickness.</p>
