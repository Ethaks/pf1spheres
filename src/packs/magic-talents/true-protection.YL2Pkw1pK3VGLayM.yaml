      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>Whenever you create an aegis or ward, you may tie it to a specific
      creature. Against that creature, the aegis or ward acts as if it had a +10
      circumstance bonus to caster level, but it is ineffective against any
      other creature. This means the aegis or ward works against attacks made by
      the creature, their abilities, or the attacks or abilities of other
      creatures it summons or controls.</p>

      <p>To be used, the caster must be able to uniquely identify the creature.
      If the caster has met the target, this is sufficient, otherwise they
      require some other means of identifying the creature. Having a sample of
      the creature&#8217;s blood or tissue works, or having the creature&#8217;s
      true name, but a description of the creature is not sufficient.</p>

      <p>The GM is the ultimate adjudicator of what is required.</p>
