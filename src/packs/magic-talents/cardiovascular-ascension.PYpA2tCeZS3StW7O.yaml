      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere (Cardiovascular Mastery
      (quicken, still)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>The drum that keeps all living creatures functional is an instrument
      you know how to outplay.</p>

      <p>As a (still) ability, you may temporarily strip a creature of the need
      for blood to allow them to keep living. As an immediate action made when a
      willing creature under your blood control would be slain or knocked
      unconscious by hit point damage, you can cause that creature to ignore the
      need for blood by spending 3 spell points. For one round, that creature
      cannot be slain by hit point damage, cannot suffer ability damage or drain
      to their Constitution, Dexterity or Strength scores and does not fall
      unconscious for having negative hit points. However, in this state, the
      creature treats their Constitution score as if it were 1, suffers a -4
      penalty to their armor class, and all temporary hit points they would gain
      are reduced to 0. After this ability expires, at the start of the
      target&#8217;s next turn, they must succeed at a Fortitude save against a
      DC of 15 + the amount of negative hit points below their death threshold
      (the number of negative hit points they may have before dying of hit point
      damage) or immediately die. If they succeed, the creature falls
      unconscious with a number of negative hit points equal to their death
      threshold plus one. As this ability is extremely taxing on a
      creature&#8217;s body to use, attempting to use this ability on a creature
      more than once every 24 hours automatically fails.</p>

      <p>As a (still) ability, you may spend two spell points to stop a
      creature&#8217;s heart entirely. At the beginning of that creature&#8217;s
      turns, they must succeed at a Fortitude save (the creature suffers a -4
      penalty to this saving throw if they are below half their maximum hit
      points) or be reduced to 1 hit point and become sickened and staggered for
      the duration of your blood control. If the creature was already at 1 point
      or lower, they are reduced to -1 hit points and fall unconscious. If the
      creature was already unconscious, or at -1 hit points or lower, they
      instead die. While under the effects of this (still) ability, a creature
      cannot benefit from healing from sources other than fast healing and
      regeneration. If a creature succeeds a saving throw against this ability,
      the creature no longer needs to attempt new Fortitude saves at the
      beginning of their turn.</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) ability, as a standard action, you can rapidly
      accelerate a creature&#8217;s heartbeat to the point it can explode by
      spending one spell point. If the target possesses any temporary hit
      points, they must succeed at a Fortitude save or otherwise have all of
      their temporary hit points removed, and afterwards suffer bludgeoning
      damage equal to the amount of temporary hit points that were removed. If a
      creature has a combined total of temporary and current hit points that is
      greater than their maximum hit points, they suffer a -4 penalty on this
      save.</p>
