      "value": "<p>You gain the following abilities:</p>\n<p>As a (still) effect, whenever the target would move more than half its movement, it must attempt an Acrobatics check against your Blood sphere DC or immediately fall prone. Additionally, the target cannot take 5-foot steps, and suffers a -2 penalty to its CMD against trip, bull rush and reposition attempts.</p>\n<p>As a (quicken) effect, the target gains a +10 feet enhancement bonus to all movement speeds. This bonus increases by an additional 5 feet every 5 caster levels you possess. Anytime the target would use this additional movement, it also becomes fatigued for 1 round.</p>\n<p>As a (still) effect, the target takes a -2 penalty on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks, concentration checks, and Intelligence- and Wisdom-based skill checks for the duration of the blood control. This penalty increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess.</p>\n<p>As a (still) effect, the target takes a -2 penalty to its CMD against disarm attempts. This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels you possess. You may spend a spell point to also force the target to succeed a Fortitude saving throw at the end of each of its turns or immediately drop one item it is currently holding. If the target fails this saving throw by 5 or more, it instead drops all items it is currently holding.</p>\n",
