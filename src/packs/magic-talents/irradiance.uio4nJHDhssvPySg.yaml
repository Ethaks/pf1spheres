      <p>Your glow sheds ionizing radiation along with visible light. When you
      cause a target to glow you may choose to make it sickened, giving it a -2
      penalty to attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks,
      and ability checks.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point to create bright light you can increase the
      intensity of the radiation. All creatures in the area of this bright light
      must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated for one round. They must
      attempt this saving throw each round they are within this area. Creatures
      that succeed on their saving throw are still sickened for that round.</p>
