      <p>You gain the ability to move your areas of darkness or blot. You can
      move one instance of darkness or blot up to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster
      levels as a move action, within the maximum range of the effect. If moving
      an area of darkness or blot causes a creature to leave its area of effect,
      any ongoing effects the creature is under related to that area of blot or
      darkness end immediately.</p>
