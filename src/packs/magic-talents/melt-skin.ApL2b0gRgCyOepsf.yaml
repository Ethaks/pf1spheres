      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere, Weather sphere
      (Radiation Lord (advanced)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, causing their skin to start
      melting off their body from the immense radiation. The target takes a -2
      penalty to AC, Fortitude saves, and all Charisma-based skill checks. The
      penalties increase by 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess.</p>
