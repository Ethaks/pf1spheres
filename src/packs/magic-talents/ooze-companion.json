      "value": "<p>Your companion mimics the properties of oozes. The companion gains the ooze creature type. Your companion can move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing. The companion gains moderate fortification.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent twice for a given companion. If taken twice, your companion gains heavy fortification, and your companion can engulf creatures in its path. As a standard action, the companion may move up to its speed and attempt to engulf any creature smaller than itself that is in its path. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which it engulfs. The companion merely has to move over its opponents, affecting as many as it can cover.</p>\n<p>Targeted creatures can make attacks of opportunity against the companion, but if they do so, they are not entitled to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Strength modifier) to avoid being engulfed&#8212;on a success, they are pushed back or aside (companion&#8217;s choice) as the companion moves forward. Engulfed creatures gain the pinned condition, are in danger of suffocating, are trapped within the companion&#8217;s body until they are no longer pinned, and take slam damage from the companion each round (1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small if no slam attack is possessed). An engulfed creature may attempt to escape as if escaping a pin.</p>\n",
