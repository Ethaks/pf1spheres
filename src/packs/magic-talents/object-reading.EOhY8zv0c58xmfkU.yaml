    value: >
      <p>You may perform psychometry on a target object you touch gaining
      information about its history or previous owners, including its creator.
      In addition to the information you acquire below, you gain a circumstance
      bonus to Appraise checks with that object equal to 1/2 your caster level
      for as long as you continue to divine the object. For every 1 minute you
      divine the object you gain one additional piece of information found in
      the following order: Last owner&#8217;s race, last owner&#8217;s gender,
      last owner&#8217;s age, last owner&#8217;s alignment, how the last owner
      lost or gained the object. Upon learning this last piece of information,
      you may spend a spell point, if you do you begin to learn information on
      the owner before the last at the same rate in the same order. Should
      object reading be interrupted for 2 or more consecutive rounds, you must
      start again at the beginning unless you spend 1 spell point per past
      owner.</p>
