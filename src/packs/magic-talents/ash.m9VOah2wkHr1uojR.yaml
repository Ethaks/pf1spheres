      <p>Ash is treated as snow, except that, beginning at severity level 4, any
      creature inhaling it must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save each round or
      be staggered for one round. The DC increases by 1 for each previous save
      and by 2 for each severity category above 4. Any creature moving through
      difficult terrain created by ash takes 1d6 slashing damage for every 10
      feet they move (rounded up). Moving through heavy ash causes 1d6 slashing
      damage for every 5 feet.</p>

      <p>Ash is a type of volcanic weather, and thus requires the Volcano Lord
      advanced talent to create.</p>
