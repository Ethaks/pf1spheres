      <p>You may spend a spell point to divine the location of a creature or
      object within range. This may be a specific creature or object or a kind
      of creature or object, but either way you must have a clear mental image
      of the creature or object to divine for it (thus, you could not divine
      broadly for traps, creatures of a broad creature type, etc.). If divining
      for a kind of creature or object, you only locate the closest item of that
      kind. This method of using divine is not blocked by wood or stone, but is
      still blocked by lead.</p>
