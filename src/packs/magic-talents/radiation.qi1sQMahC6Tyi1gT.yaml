      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Light sphere (Irradiance (light)),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When you spend a spell point to create bright light with the Irradiance
      talent, you may spend an additional spell point to create higher energy
      radiation. Creatures in the area who fail the Fortitude save against
      nausea also contract low radiation, as described in the Radiation Blast
      advanced Destruction talent. This cannot stack with itself to increase
      radiation to higher levels, but can stack with other sources of
      radiation.</p>
