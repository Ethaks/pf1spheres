    value: >
      <p>Rather than targeting creatures, this word targets doors, chests, and
      other objects that can open or close. You may spend a spell point to open
      a door or container, as if you were attempting a Disable Device check to
      unlock it or, if the opening is stuck and no lock is present, a Strength
      check to force it open. Attempt a magic skill check with a +10 bonus
      against the lock&#8217;s Disable Device DC or the door&#8217;s Stuck
      DC.</p>

      <p>If the check is successful, the portal unlocks and opens. This word may
      open doors, chests, shackles, and chains, and any other type of fastening.
      It cannot, however, raise a barred gate, lift a portcullis, or otherwise
      provide force in and of itself.</p>

      <p>You may also spend a spell point and speak a word that magically holds
      shut a door, gate, chest, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The
      portal closes and, if a lock is present, becomes locked. The DC to open
      the lock or force open the portal both increase by 10. Once the opening or
      portal has been forced or picked open, this effect ends.</p>
