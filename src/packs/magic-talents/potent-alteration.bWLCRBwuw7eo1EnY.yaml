      <p>Increase the amount of damage dealt or damage healed when you use your
      Destroy or Repair ability to 1d6 + your caster level.</p>

      <p>When altering an object, you may spend an additional spell point to
      affect magical objects, attended objects, or constructs. While this means
      you may Repair damaged or destroyed magical items, you cannot restore the
      magic to such an object unless your caster level is at least equal to the
      item&#8217;s caster level. Items with charges (such as wands) and
      single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be Repaired in this
      way.</p>

      <p>If used against an attended object, this requires a touch attack, and
      the creature attending the object can attempt a Will save to negate. If
      used against an animate object, this is a touch attack but does not grant
      a saving throw. If the object or object&#8217;s wielder is unwilling, they
      are also allowed a Fortitude save to halve the damage (in the case of
      Destroy) or otherwise negate the effect.</p>
