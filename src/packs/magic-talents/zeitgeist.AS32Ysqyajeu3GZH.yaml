      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Mass Charm [mass], Project
      Thoughts (charm)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional 1, 2, or 3 spell points and take 10 minutes
      to affect large communities of 200 or smaller, 2,000 or smaller, or 5,000
      or smaller (respectively) with a single lesser or greater version of a
      charm. Every individual within this community of 3 or fewer Hit Dice is
      automatically affected by this charm, while everyone with 4 or more Hit
      Dice receives a Will save as normal with a +4 bonus. This effect lasts for
      a number of hours equal to your caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> GMs using the Zeitgeist talent to create an
      enthralled thorpe or all-too-sleepy little village are encouraged to not
      roll the Will saves until player characters arrive &#8220;on
      screen&#8221;, and to recall that many, many NPC citizens will have fewer
      than 3 Hit Dice and not be permitted a save. Waiting for the PCs to arrive
      will save prep time and cut down on NPC note mismanagement, even if you do
      realize that a plot-crucial NPC was actually unaffected and should have
      been active elsewhere from time to time.</p>
