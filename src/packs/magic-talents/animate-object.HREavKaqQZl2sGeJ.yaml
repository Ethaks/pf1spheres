      <p>You may spend a spell point to enhance an object, bestowing movement
      and a semblance of life. The object obeys your command and understands
      your language, but as it is not intelligent, it can only obey simple
      commands such as &#8216;move&#8217;, &#8216;fight&#8217;,
      &#8216;guard&#8217;, &#8216;stop&#8217;, etc.</p>

      <p>If you animate an enemy&#8217;s weapon, the weapon cannot move and
      attack while it is being held, but the wielder must succeed at a Reflex
      save (DC 10 + 1/2 caster level + casting ability modifier) each round they
      hold the item or lose their action fighting their weapon for control. If
      you animate an enemy&#8217;s armor or clothing, the enemy becomes
      entangled and must succeed at a Reflex save each round or be staggered for
      that round. Animated objects are constructs, and gain Hit Dice according
      to their size. The maximum sized object you may animate depends on your
      caster level, according to Table: Animate Object.</p>

      <p>You can only have a number of animated object Hit Dice at once equal to
      twice your caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Animated Object Special Qualities</strong><br>

      All animated objects possess construction qualities and construction
      flaws. However, these are not options the player has the power to choose;
      an animated object&#8217;s construction qualities and flaws are instead
      chosen by the GM to reflect the item in question. For example, animating
      an object made from cloth grants it the &#8216;cloth&#8217; construction
      flaw, while animating a slingshot would create an animated object with the
      ranged attack construction quality.</p>
