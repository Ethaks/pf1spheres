    value: >
      <p>You grant the target a competence bonus to initiative checks equal to
      1/2 your caster level (minimum 1) and the ability to act in the surprise
      round even if they fail their Perception check to notice the presence of
      foes. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell
      point to allow it to remain for 10 minutes per caster level without
      concentration.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent up to three times; the second time you take
      this talent, affected targets also gain evasion (or improved evasion if
      they already have evasion) and a +2 competence bonus on Reflex saving
      throws. The third time you take this talent, affected targets also gain
      uncanny dodge (or improved uncanny dodge if they already have uncanny
      dodge) as a rogue of your caster level and increase the competence bonus
      on Reflex saving throws to +4.</p>
