      <p>You may create a darkness that is unnaturally edgy. Any creature inside
      the darkness must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d6 slashing damage per
      3 caster levels (minimum 1d6). Creatures who remain within this area of
      darkness must save at the end of your subsequent turns or take additional
      slashing damage. If a creature enters this area of darkness after it is
      created, they must immediately save or also suffer this damage. A creature
      may only be affected by Edge Of Night once per round, regardless of how
      many times they enter or exit the area that round.</p>
