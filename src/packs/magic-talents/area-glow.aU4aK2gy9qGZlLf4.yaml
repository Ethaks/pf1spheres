      <p>You may spend a spell point to create an eruption of light, causing all
      creatures and objects within a 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels radius
      centered within range to glow. You do not need to make a ranged touch
      attack against any creature within this area. You may only make a single
      target glow brightly as part of applying an area glow chosen after the
      targets are affected.</p>
