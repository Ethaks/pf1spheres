    value: >
      <p>When you place a glow effect on a creature, you may choose to deal it
      1d4 nonlethal fire damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d4). The creature
      takes this damage each round the glow is in effect. A successful Fortitude
      save negates the damage for that round, while two consecutive Fortitude
      saves ends the effect.</p>

      <p>If you cause this glow to shed bright light, the target also becomes
      fatigued the next time they take nonlethal damage from this effect. If
      they are already fatigued, they instead become exhausted. This fatigue or
      exhaustion cannot be recovered from until the target has been healed of
      the nonlethal damage taken from this effect.</p>
