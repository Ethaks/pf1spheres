    value: >
      <p>As a swift action, you may grow up to two bite attacks in place of up
      to two hands you possess, one per hand, until the end of your turn. This
      is a polymorph effect, but can be added on top of other polymorph effects
      and does not override them.</p>

      <p>These hands become incapable of holding objects or weapons while they
      are replaced with bite attacks. You are considered armed while in
      possession of these bite attacks. You may spend a spell point when
      activating this ability to cause the bite attacks to remain until the end
      of the bear spirit.</p>

      <p>The granted bite attacks count as both unarmed strikes and natural
      weapons, and deal 1d6 damage for a Medium creature. For every 5 caster
      levels you possess, increase the damage die size by 1 step.</p>
