      <p>You may change your destructive blast into a blast of air. An air blast
      deals nonlethal bludgeoning damage. You may make a bull rush as a free
      action at range against the target or targets struck by your air blast or
      that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required. Your CMB for
      this check is your caster level + your casting ability modifier, and all
      targets are pushed from the point of origin of the effect. (This is
      usually yourself, but if using a talent such as Explosive Orb, it would be
      the center of the blast. If using Energy Wall, each square of wall is
      considered the center of effect for those who enter that section. If using
      Guided Strike, you may choose from which direction you want to push the
      target, even pushing them up or down if you should desire. Pushing a
      target into the ground knocks them prone if the bull rush is
      successful.)</p>

      <p>If the target is knocked into a solid object, they suffer 1d6
      bludgeoning damage, +1d6 for every 5 feet they would have continued past
      the barrier. You do not move with the targets of your bull rush.</p>
