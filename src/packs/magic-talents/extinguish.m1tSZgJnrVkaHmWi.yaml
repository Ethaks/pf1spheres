    value: >
      <p>You may opt to instantly extinguish all non-magical light sources
      within your areas of darkness, not merely suppress them. This includes
      fire, incandescence, and alchemical sources. Coals turn cold, glowing-hot
      metal is made cool, and luminous chemicals are rendered inert.
      Additionally, your darkness can be used to dispel sources of magical light
      and flame (such as an Energy Wall consisting of fire) with a magic skill
      check. This is an instantaneous effect that occurs when the area of
      darkness is created. Creatures made of flame or other luminous materials
      or energies are not harmed by this talent.</p>
