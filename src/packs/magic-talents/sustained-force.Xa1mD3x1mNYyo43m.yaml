    value: >
      <p>As a free action, you can spend a spell point to no longer need to
      concentrate to maintain lifting a particular object for up to 1 minute per
      caster level. You may give a Sustained Force simple orders (float in the
      air, go north, follow a target) that it obeys to the best of its ability,
      to a maximum of your telekinesis range. Changing a Sustained Force&#8217;s
      orders is a move action.</p>

      <p>You cannot sustain combat-related uses of telekinesis (combat
      maneuvers, Bludgeons, etc.), nor complicated tasks (make a wagon load
      itself with stones and move them to another location, etc.). You may
      dismiss a Sustained Force as a standard action.</p>

      <h3 id="toc5"><span>Wiki Note: Telekinesis and Attack Actions</span></h3>

      <p>You generally cannot make more than one attack action per round, even
      when using Telekinesis to manipulate multiple weapons and attacking with
      them individually.</p>

      <h3 id="toc6"><span>Wiki Note: Telekinesis and Maneuvers</span></h3>

      <p>Maneuvers created by telekinesis talents do not originate from you and
      do not work with many effects that require that (such as many combat
      talents) unless you have an additional ability allowing this.</p>
