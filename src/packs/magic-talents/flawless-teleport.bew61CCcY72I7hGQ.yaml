      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Distant Teleport, True
      Teleport (advanced), Unseeing Teleport), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When using the True Teleport advanced talent, the range is increased to
      unlimited (excluding interplanetary transport) and you no longer suffer a
      chance of arriving off-target, always appearing exactly where you
      intended. When using the Planeshift advanced talent, you no longer appear
      off-target from your intended destination on the other plane.</p>

      <p>You need not have seen the destination you are trying to reach, but in
      that case you must have at least a reliable description of the place to
      which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient
      information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply
      reappear in your original location.</p>
