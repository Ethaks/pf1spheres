    value: >
      <p>You may enhance a weapon, granting it the corrosive, flaming, frost, or
      shock weapon special abilities. The weapons deal an extra point of
      elemental damage for every 2 caster levels possessed.</p>

      <p>You may also apply this enhancement to a consumable item, a splash
      weapon, or a dose of poison. Targets who consume the item, suffer direct
      or splash damage from the splash weapon, or are struck with the poison
      (whether or not they fail their saving throw) also suffer acid, cold,
      electricity, or fire damage (chosen at the time the enhancement is
      created) equal to your caster level.</p>
