      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere (Call Planar
      Creature (advanced)), caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>When using the Call Planar Creature advanced talent to call hostile
      creatures, your traps are even harder to break than usual. If you spend 10
      minutes and succeed at a DC 20 Spellcraft check to prepare a summoning
      circle before you call a creature, that creature finds it very difficult
      to escape. You cannot know the result of your Spellcraft check until after
      the calling is performed, but you may take 20 on this check by dedicating
      3 hours and 20 minutes to creating the circle.</p>

      <p>If your check is successful, the called creature cannot use its spell
      resistance to attempt to escape its prison, nor use any dimensional or
      teleportation effects, nor can any of its abilities or attacks cross the
      prison&#8217;s border. When pitting its Charisma against your trap, the DC
      increases by 5. While a creature cannot disturb the summoning circle, if
      any outside force disturbs the circle (even a hair falling across it), the
      called creature is immediately freed.</p>
