    value: >
      <p>Choose Aridity, Cold, Heat, Precipitation, or Wind. The target suffers
      the effect of that weather at severity level 3. Precipitation of severity
      level 3 causes light rain, not fog. If you possess talents or feats that
      would increase the severity of that type of weather that you can create,
      apply that increase to the effects of this shroud. If the target is
      already in weather of the chosen type at the same severity or higher, it
      suffers the effect of the chosen type of weather as if it were one step
      more severe.</p>

      <p>This shroud counts as whichever type of weather you chose for the
      purpose of causing additional effects. You may apply this shroud multiple
      times to a single target, choosing a different type of weather each
      time.</p>
