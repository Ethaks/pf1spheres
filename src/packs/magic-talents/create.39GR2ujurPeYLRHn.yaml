      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to create a
      non-magical, unattended object out of vegetable matter such as wood, hemp,
      or cotton in either your hand or an adjacent square. You may create
      objects with multiple materials, provided you can create all the materials
      required. Adamantine cannot be altered or created, except for the Repair
      and Destroy abilities. The object may be of equivalent size to one Small
      object per caster level (see chart below) and lasts as long as you
      continue to concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. When
      creating an object you may spend an additional spell point to allow that
      object to persist for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. A
      created object may be dismissed as a standard action.</p>

      <p>If the created object is especially large, it must begin in an adjacent
      square and must be completely contained within close range. You may choose
      to create objects that can be moved easily, or can create objects that are
      anchored to an unattended surface large enough to hold that part of the
      object (such as a bridge being anchored to both sides of a gap, or a wall
      growing out of the ground). You cannot create an object directly onto a
      creature or attended object (summoning manacles onto someone&#8217;s
      wrists, etc.).</p>

      <p>When attempting to break an object that does not have a predetermined
      Break DC, the Break DC is equal to 10 + the object&#8217;s hardness +1 per
      inch in the item&#8217;s thickness. For example, a 2-inch thick stone wall
      would have a Break DC of 10 + 8 hardness + 2 inches, or DC 20.</p>

      <p>Generally speaking, you cannot create alchemical items, poisons,
      materials that deal damage on contact or items that carry special
      properties or knowledge you do not possess (rare herbs, the key to a lock
      you did not construct, etc.). While simple objects such as candles, folds
      of cloth, simple furniture, or basic weapons are easy to create;
      particularly complex objects (mechanics, crossbows, objects with moving
      parts) require a Craft check made against the object&#8217;s Craft DC.
      Likewise, non-magical common herbs can be created through a successful
      Knowledge (Nature) check, such as wolfsbane or the night tea plant. For
      herbs and items with no predetermined Craft DC, the check DC is assumed to
      be equal to 10 +1 per 5 gp in the item&#8217;s cost, though any items with
      a DC above 15 cannot be made. Failure means the object comes into being
      broken and unusable, or otherwise incorrect.</p>

      <p>A DC 15 Appraise check reveals the object as a magical fake. Fabricated
      objects have a lingering magical aura that can be detected as magic,
      although the objects themselves are not magical.</p>

      <p>There are dozens of ways a created object can interact with the world,
      and many of the details of those interactions are determined by the GM.
      The following notes, however, include clarifications about various types
