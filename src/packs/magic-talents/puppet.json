      "value": "<p>Your Conjuration sphere companion is incapable of action without your direct control. You must spend an action for your companion to take the same action (swift for swift, standard for standard, etc.). A puppet companion may make attacks of opportunity by spending your attacks of opportunity if you have controlled it since the beginning of your last turn. Spending at least a move action this way counts as concentrating on the summon for that round. Any round you do not spend directing the companion, it stands mindlessly and counts as having the dazed condition. Your companion may still gain feats and skills (unless also possessing the mindless archetype); you may use the companion&#8217;s feats, skills, casting, and other abilities when directing the companion, though you may not use your own through the companion. Any effect that would possess or exercise mental control over a puppet companion (including enchantment charm effects and enchantment compulsion effects) requires a successful magical skill check against the summoner&#8217;s MSD. A puppet companion takes a -2 penalty on all rolls if it is outside of your close range. If you do not have line of sight to the puppet companion, it is treated as being blinded. Both these penalties are removed if you possess the Link talent.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you may order a puppet companion to follow. Doing so causes the puppet to take move actions on its turn (including trading its standard action for a move action) to attempt to move adjacent to you (or as close as it is able) to the best of its ability. Should the companion be unable to find you (such as in a complex maze when you are out of sight for too long, if you are teleported out of view, etc.), the companion will remain in its current position. Taking any other action through the companion ends this ability. The spell point cost of summoning a puppet companion is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).</p>\n",
