      <p>You may create either a hallowed or unhallowed totem. If creating a
      hallowed totem, all creatures within the area of this totem suffer a -1
      penalty to saving throws made to resist channeled positive energy and
      positive energy effects such as cure spells and Life sphere effects. This
      penalty increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels. If creating an
      unhallowed totem, this penalty instead applies to channeled negative
      energy and negative energy effects, such as inflict spells and Death
      sphere effects. If you place a hallowed totem in a location that already
      has an unhallowed totem present or vice versa, you must succeed at a magic
      skill check to place your totem. On a success, the two totems cancel each
      other, leaving neither hallowed totem nor unhallowed totem in place.</p>
