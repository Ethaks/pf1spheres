      <p>Your darkness takes on a foul, miasmic quality that causes creatures to
      choke and retch. Creatures within must succeed at a Fortitude save or
      become sickened until they leave the area of Black Lung. Creatures who
      succeed at this save but remain in the darkness must save again at the end
      of their turn. If any creature enters this area of darkness, they must
      save or immediately become sickened. Creatures with the Verbal Casting
      drawback suffer 50% spell failure while they are sickened by Black Lung.
      Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected by Black Lung.</p>

      <p>By taking this talent a second time, you may imbue your Black Lung with
      a dose of contact or inhalation poison held in your hand. Using this
      ability consumes the dose of poison. Any creature that fails its save
      against the Black Lung talent must succeed at an additional Fortitude save
      against the poison&#8217;s DC or suffer its effects. Those immune to your
      Black Lung are also immune to the poison. There is no chance of
      accidentally poisoning yourself when using this ability.</p>
