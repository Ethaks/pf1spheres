      <p>You may create an aegis that stabilizes the target against planar
      effects or effects that warp time and space. The target gains a +4 morale
      bonus to AC and saving throws against any teleportation effects, effects
      from the Time or Warp spheres, direct telekinesis (such as Hostile Lift,
      but not attacks from Bludgeons) as well as any other effects that alter
      time, such as the slow spell. This also applies to attacks and abilities
      from extraplanar creatures, such as summoned or conjured creatures.</p>
