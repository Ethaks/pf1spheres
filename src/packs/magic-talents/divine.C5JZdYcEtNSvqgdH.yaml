      <p>You may divine to gain information. To divine, you must spend 1 minute
      meditating, although you may spend a spell point to decrease this time to
      a single standard action. Divining always has a duration of concentration,
      but you must spend a full-round action concentrating (you can take no
      other action except free actions); you are flat-footed while concentrating
      on divining. Divining reveals information from sources within medium range
      of you as an emanation; it reveals information each round the effect it is
      maintained. Divining can penetrate most barriers, but 3 feet of wood or
      dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead
      blocks it.</p>

      <p>When you gain the Divination sphere, you gain the ability to divine for
      magical auras, learning their strength and location. You do not know the
      exact caster level of an item or spell, but you may sense the aura&#8217;s
      general strength according to the chart below. To determine the spell
      school or sphere of the effect, you must succeed at a Knowledge (arcana)
      check with a DC equal to 15 + 1/2 the caster level.</p>

      <p>A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the
      case of spells and sphere effects) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic
      item). In such a case, divining reveals an aura strength of dim (even
      weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level
      depends on its original power:</p>

      <p>When using Spellcraft to identify the properties of a magic item or
      ongoing effect, you may use divine in place of the detect magic spell.
      Outsiders and elementals are not magical in and of themselves, but if they
      are summoned, the conjuration effect registers.</p>

      <p><strong>Overwhelming Auras:</strong> Whenever an individual divines or
      senses an aura whose strength is overwhelming, from a source whose Hit
      Dice or caster level is equal to or greater than the caster's character
      level + 10, that individual becomes stunned for 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Shapechanger:</strong> You may divine for creatures with
      the shapechanger subtype. The strength of a shapechanger aura is
      determined according to Table: Shapechanger. If a creature is not a
      shapechanger but is under the effect of a shapeshift Alteration sphere (or

      <h3 id="toc3"><span>Blood</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Bleeding:</strong> You may divine the location of any
      creature that has taken bleed damage in the last 10 minutes per caster
      level or that is under half its maximum hit points. Creatures immune to
      bleed damage cannot be detected with this divination.</p>

      <h3 id="toc4"><span>Conjuration</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Unnaturals:</strong> You may divine the presence of
      outsiders and aberrations. In all other ways, this functions as divining
      for shapeshifters.</p>

      <h3 id="toc5"><span>Creation</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Components:</strong> You may divine for a material of
      which you can create using the Creation sphere.</p>

      <h3 id="toc6"><span>Dark</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Dark:</strong> You may divine the light levels of the
      surrounding area within range. When using this alternate divination, you
      may spend an additional spell point to also divine the location and size
      of shadows cast by creatures or objects. You do not gain additional
      information, such as whether the shadow was cast by a creature or an
      object, or the size of said creatures or objects.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Shadow:</strong> You may divine the presence of
      creatures or objects native to the Plane of Shadow. In all other ways,
      this functions as divining for shapeshifters. Shadowstuff, such as that
      created from the fey adept class or those with the sphere-specific
      drawback Limited Creation (shadowstuff) count as originating from the
      Plane of Shadow for the purpose of this divination.</p>

      <h3 id="toc7"><span>Death</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Undead:</strong> You may divine for undead creatures. In
      all other ways, this functions as divining for shapeshifters.</p>

      <h3 id="toc8"><span>Destruction</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Hostility:</strong> You may divine whenever a creature
      or an object within range takes hit point damage. In addition, you gain
      knowledge as to the amount and type of damage dealt and from what
      direction the damage was dealt from. If the source of the damage is inside
      the area of your divine effect, you also learn what square the source
      occupied.</p>

      <h3 id="toc9"><span>Enhancement</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Enhancement:</strong> You may divine what short-term
      effects creatures you have pinpointed are undergoing. You may divine all
      creatures you can see within range and determine which (if any) are
      benefiting from temporary bonuses, and the sources of the bonuses be they
      magical, alchemical, supernatural, etc.</p>

      <h3 id="toc10"><span>Fallen Fey</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Detect Faetouched:</strong> You may divine the location of any
      creature that possesses the elf, fey, gnome, sidheir, or similar types or
      subtypes. In all other ways, this functions as divining for
      shapeshifters.</p>

      <h3 id="toc11"><span>Fate</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Detect Loyalties:</strong> You may divine the top three general
      things that matter most to the creatures you can see within range.
      Examples of base loyalties may include but are not limited to: Country,
      Faith, Family, Power, and Self. Subcategories for base loyalties may also
      exist where appropriate such as Self (survival) or Self (perfection), but
      they are generally not revealed with Detect Loyalties. While you do not
      learn specific details such as proper names of the associated loyalties,
      you do acquire the order in which the loyalties stand. For example, a
      paladin might have loyalties of Country, Power, and Self, but would not
      reveal the particular country they are loyal to or the particular power
      they serve. Mindless creatures might have only 1 loyalty such as Self
      (survival), whereas creatures with low animal-like intelligence might only
      have 2 loyalties such as Family (pack) and Self (survival). Only the top
      three loyalties are revealed, even if they have more.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Alignment:</strong> You may divine for a specific part
      of the alignment spectrum: evil, good, lawful, or chaotic. The strength of
      these auras are determined according to Chart: Alignment.</p>

      <p>Traps, poisons, and other potential perils have no alignment. Creatures
      with aligned intents (killing in anger, aiding those in need for their own
      sakes, etc.) may temporarily detect according to their actions.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Fate:</strong> You may divine the alignment auras of
      creatures you can see within range. Such creatures emit a colored aura
      depending upon what alignments or loyalties you share with them. Creatures
      that share the same moral alignment (good/neutral/evil) emit a red aura.
      Creatures that share the same ethical alignment (lawful/neutral/chaotic)
      emit a blue aura. Creatures that share a primary base loyalty (see Detect
      Loyalties) emit a yellow aura. Creatures that share multiple colors have
      their colors combined, i.e. a creature that shares the primary base
      loyalty of family and the ethical alignment of chaos will emit a green
      aura. Creatures that share all three primary colors (red, blue, and
      yellow) emit a glowing white aura. Refer to Table: Divine Fate below for
      more information on how colored auras combine. Creatures that do not share
      any alignment or loyalties do not emit any aura that you can see.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Illusions:</strong> You may divine for illusions. This
      grants you a free Will save or Perception check (in the case of
      illusionary disguises or invisibility) against any illusions or
      invisibility within the area.</p>

      <h3 id="toc13"><span>Life</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Life:</strong> You may divine the wound thresholds and
      conditions of seen living creatures. In addition to learning the
      creature&#8217;s wound status, you also learn which creatures, if any, are
      afflicted with a disease. The strength of Divine Life&#8217;s aura reveals
      a creature&#8217;s current wound threshold and condition according to

      <h3 id="toc14"><span>Light</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Ultravision:</strong> You may divine to give yourself an added
      level of perception. Once per round you may attempt a Perception check as
      a free action (normally a move action) with a circumstance bonus to
      Perception checks equal to your caster level.</p>

      <h3 id="toc15"><span>Mana</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Mana Capacity:</strong> If you possess the Mana sphere,
      you may divine for the amount of spell points a creature has. Each round
      while divining for mana capacity, you may choose one creature you can see
      within range each round to learn their current amount of real spell
      points, temporary spell points (as well as when they end), and maximum
      spell point pool capacity.</p>

      <h3 id="toc16"><span>Mind</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Cares Given [Jester's HB]:</strong> You may divine for a
      specific subject of interest, chosen when you divine. This is similar to
      reading the surface thoughts of nearby creatures, but only locates
      creatures with strong opinions about a specific topic or subject chosen
      when you divine, such as politics, war, entertainment, or professional
      associations. Creatures may have a positive, negative, or uninterested
      opinion regarding a subject. Only creatures with a positive or negative
      opinion are located. This effect does not discern what opinion each
      located creature may hold, only that the creature has an opinion.</p>

      <p>For example, divining about a specific criminal organization, both
      members of the organization and opposing factions may hold strong
      feelings, positive or negative. Unconcerned or uninvolved individuals
      would not be located by the effect, and a located creature&#8217;s precise
      opinion is not made known to you.</p>

      <p><strong>Divine Charm:</strong> You may divine for the presence of
      charm, compulsion, possession, and Mind sphere effects. You do not need to
      attempt a Knowledge (arcana) check to identify the school or sphere of
      these abilities.</p>

      <h3 id="toc17"><span>Nature</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Elements:</strong> You may divine for the elements,
      depending on which packages you possess.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>If you possess the (air) package, you may divine and identify the
      presence of breathable air, and toxic gases or vapor (or lack thereof if
      in a vacuum).</li>

      <li>If you possess the (earth) package you may divine and identify the
      presence of dirt, gems, sand, and stone.</li>

      <li>If you possess the (fire) package you may divine the presence and
      strength of fires.</li>

      <li>If you possess the (metal) package, you may divine and identify the
      presence of ore deposits and metals.</li>

      <li>If you possess the (plant) package you may divine the location of
      plantlife and plant creatures. In all other ways, this functions as
      divining for shapeshifters.</li>

      <li>If you possess a Nature (spirit) talent, you may divine the location
      of animal creatures. In all other ways, this functions as divining for
      shapeshifters.</li>

      <li>If you possess the (water) package you may divine the location and
      size of bodies of water.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 id="toc18"><span>Protection</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Protection:</strong> You may divine all creatures you
      have pinpointed within range and determine which of those creatures have
      the lowest and highest armor class. Alternatively, you may divine the
      lowest and highest saving throw each of these creatures has. You do not
      however determine the values for any of these attributes.</p>

      <h3 id="toc19"><span>Telekinesis</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Density:</strong> You may divine the density and weight
      of nearby objects and creatures that you can see. Utilize the following

      <p><strong>Divine Force:</strong> You may divine the presence or absence
      of creatures with the incorporeal subtype. For the purpose of this
      ability, creatures such as unseen servant and other similar creatures of
      force are considered to have the incorporeal subtype. This ability will
      not not reveal the general location or direction in which the incorporeal
      creatures are, it will, however, give you knowledge of the incorporeal
      creature&#8217;s aura utilizing the same table as divining for
      shapeshifters.</p>

      <h3 id="toc20"><span>Time</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Time:</strong> You may divine the events that happened
      within range. You can only divine what occurred up to 1 hour per caster
      level in the past. When you divine time you are only given the following
      details: The number of creatures that were in the area, their size, how
      long they remained in the area, and any movements they made while in the
      area. In addition, if objects were left unattended or unattended objects
      were moved during this time, you learn the size and vague shape of such
      objects.</p>

      <h3 id="toc21"><span>War</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Allegiance:</strong> You may target an individual within
      range which allows you to divine through mud, blood, sweat, and wear or
      tear upon cloth or armor as if such was not there, revealing any colors,
      patterns, or insignia it may have previously bore. In addition, other
      creatures within range of the target glows with a particular aura allowing
      the caster to know who they openly allied with and who are not. Creatures
      under the affect of mind-affecting effects (such as charms and
      compulsions) are shown to be loyal to their controller and their allies.
      This does not properly function on those who are using subterfuge or are
      pretending to be on someone&#8217;s side, as it will present them as who
      they pretend to side with. Once each round as a free action while
      maintaining concentration on this effect, you may target a different
      individual within range with this divine ability.</p>

      <h3 id="toc22"><span>Warp</span></h3>

      <p><strong>Divine Warp:</strong> You may divine the presence of portals,
      rifts (including extradimensional spaces), and teleportation circles, both
      active and inactive within range. If you perceived a target teleport
      within the last hour, this also reveals to you the general direction and
      distance of their teleportation. If the creature teleports to a different
      plane, you immediately learn this, but you do not learn to what plane the
      creature teleported unless your caster level is at least 10. Should you
      find yourself on that plane before the hour is up, you can divine their
      general direction and distance.</p>

      <h3 id="toc23"><span>Weather</span></h3>
