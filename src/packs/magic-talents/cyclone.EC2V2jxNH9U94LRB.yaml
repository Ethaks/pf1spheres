      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((air) package,
      Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to create a
      powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the
      ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. This cyclone is 10
      feet wide at the base, 30 feet wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. You can
      concentrate on controlling the cyclone&#8217;s every movement or spend an
      additional spell point to allow it to exist for 1 round per caster level
      without concentration, in which case you must specify a simple program
      (directing the cyclone&#8217;s movement or changing its programmed
      movement is a standard action). The cyclone always moves during your turn.
      If the cyclone exceeds the effect&#8217;s range, it moves in a random,
      uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You cannot
      regain control of the cyclone, even if it comes back within range.)</p>

      <p>Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell
      effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A
      Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a
      second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its
      powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with
      no save allowed.</p>

      <p>You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you
      wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when
      they are released.</p>
