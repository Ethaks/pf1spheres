      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a destructive blast as an area
      effect, affecting your choice of either a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5
      caster levels burst, a close-range cone, or a medium-range line, each
      emanating from yourself but excluding yourself from the effects. You do
      not need to make any attack roll for area attacks, but creatures in the
      effect are allowed a Reflex saving throw for half damage. These ranges are
      not increased by the Extended Range talent or similar effects.</p>
