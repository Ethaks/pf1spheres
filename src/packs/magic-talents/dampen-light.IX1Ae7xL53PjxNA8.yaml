    value: >
      <p>You can dampen light in an area. This functions similarly to creating
      darkness, using the same range and area, but it lasts for 1 minute per
      caster level without the need for concentration and only lowers light
      levels by one step within the area.</p>

      <p>In addition, you cannot apply (darkness) talents to these areas, though
      (meld) talents function within them as if they were an area of darkness.
      You may also apply talents that would change the area or duration of your
      darkness (such as Greater Darkness or Eternal Darkness) to use of this
      talent.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice; when taken a second time, you may
      choose to lower light levels by two steps when you use this talent.</p>
