      "value": "<p>You may manipulate an ongoing magical effect that still holds most of its magical power to fuel yourself. You may target a creature within range that is currently under the effects of a harmless sphere effect, causing the effect to end. If the effect had a duration greater than 1 minute, and at least half or more of its original duration remaining, you convert it into raw energy, granting yourself temporary spell points equal to half the effect&#8217;s cost in spell points (minimum 1). If the effect cost no spell points to cast, or was cast using temporary spell points (either partially or in full), you gain no spell points. At 10th level, you instead gain spell points equal to its full cost, but only if the duration was greater than 1 hour.</p>\n<p>Targeting yourself with this ability only requires a swift action, and targeting an unwilling creature requires you to attempt a magic skill check against the effect, with a -2 penalty on the attempt. If you possess the Counterspell feat, you reduce this penalty to 0. If you fail to use this ability on a magical effect, you may not try to dispel that effect again for 24 hours.</p>\n",
