    value: >
      <p>As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and
      instill a spirit effect inside it, which functions as a potion or oil.
      Spirit effects with an instantaneous or concentration duration cannot be
      instilled, and if you do not have the ability to grant spirit effects to
      other creatures, the instilled liquid is only usable by you.</p>

      <p>An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell
      points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost
      of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not
      an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent
      and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the
      instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a
      single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single
      action.</p>
