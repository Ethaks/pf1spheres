      <p>The target&#8217;s vision is tinted a soft-red. As a standard action,
      the target of this lens may fire a blinding burst of light as either a
      30-foot cone or 60-foot line centered on the target. Creatures caught in
      the area of effect must succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded for 1
      round, and dazzled for one minute. The target must wait at least 1d4
      rounds between uses of this ability.</p>

      <p>When using this (lens) talent to fire a blinding burst, the target may
      end this (lens) talent as a free action to cause creatures who fail their
      Reflex saving throw to also take 1d4 points of fire damage per caster
      level.</p>
