      <p>You may place this word on a creature marking them as a villain
      regardless of their actual role in fate&#8217;s story. A successful Will
      save negates this effect. While this word is in effect, any of your allies
      may use their smite, challenge, or similar ability that requires marking a
      particular adversary, or a class feature that only affects a particular
      alignment, even if the target would not normally be affected by the
      ability (such as a neutral creature by a paladin&#8217;s smite evil). When
      this word&#8217;s effect ends, so does the effect of these abilities. You
      may also, as a free action even when it is not your turn, spend a spell
      point to allow an ally to use such an effect without spending a daily use
      or to give an ally without one of these abilities or who choose not to use
      that ability a +1 bonus to attack and weapon damage rolls against the
      target of this word. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend
      an additional spell point to allow the effect to endure for 1 round per
      caster level without concentration.</p>
