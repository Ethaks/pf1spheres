    value: >
      <p>By spending an additional spell point when you create an object less
      than half of your maximum size, you may delay your creation so that rather
      than create a single object once, it creates a multitude of identical
      objects over time. The total size of all created objects cannot exceed
      double your create maximum size. You must set a parameter when this effect
      is created for when and where within range the items are created; (for
      example, creating a new arrow in a quiver whenever the previous arrow is
      removed, or dropping a new anvil each round onto a target location,
      determined at the time of casting). This continues for the duration of the
      create effect or until the maximum size (or another non-standard limit)
      has been reached, whichever comes first. A replication effect cannot
      create more than 1/4th of its maximum size in a single round, and cannot
      drop items on or encase a single target multiple times in the same round.
      Using this talent allows the create effect to persist for 1 minute per
      caster level without concentration at no additional cost.</p>
