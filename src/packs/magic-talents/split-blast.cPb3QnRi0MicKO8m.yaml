      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Admixture, Blast
      Salvo (blast shape)).</p>

      <p>When you use Admixture in conjunction with the Blast Salvo blast shape,
      you may cause some of the surges to use one blast type used in the
      Admixture while other surges use the other blast type. For example, a
      character who uses Admixture with Fire Blast and Numbing Blast talents
      could fire one surge that deals fire damage and causes a target to catch
      on fire as well as a second surge that deals cold damage and causes the
      target to take a penalty on Fortitude saves.</p>

      <p>This talent may be used in conjunction with Admixture feats, in which
      case any surge which applies the effect of a sphere besides the
      Destruction sphere may either deal bludgeoning damage as a basic
      destructive blast with no blast type or deal no damage but count as a
      surge of 1 die (chosen when the surge is fired).</p>

      <p>When using Admixture in conjunction with this talent to fire a blast
      salvo in which each surge only carries a single blast type, you may spend
      2 spell points to fire one additional surge plus another per three caster
      levels rather than per six caster levels.</p>
