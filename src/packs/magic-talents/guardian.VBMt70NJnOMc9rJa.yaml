    value: >
      <p>You may create an aegis that draws harmful attention to its bearer and
      away from their allies. Any hostile target within 10 feet of the bearer of
      this aegis who decides to target any creature other than the bearer of
      this aegis suffers a -1 penalty to their attack roll. This penalty
      increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels possessed. Multiple Guardian
      aegises do not stack; if a creature attacks one creature with this aegis
      while within the area of another creature with this aegis, they suffer no
      penalty for their attack.</p>
