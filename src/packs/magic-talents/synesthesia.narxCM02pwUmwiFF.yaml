    value: >
      <p>As a trick, you can link two senses allowing you to, for example, see
      sound or smell color. You become dazed until the end of your next turn,
      and gain any one complex sense you are able to fool with your illusions
      until the end of your next turn. The range of this sense is limited to 5
      feet per caster level. If you possess Overwhelming Sensation, you may
      improve the range of the sense by an additional 5 feet per caster level
      but become deafened and blinded instead of dazed.</p>
