    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to speak a word that frees the target from
      physical bondage. You must concentrate to maintain this ability, to a
      maximum of 1 round per caster level. You may spend an additional spell
      point as a free action to allow this ability to continue for 1 round per
      caster level without concentration. The target may move and attack
      normally, even when under the influence of magic and effects that would
      otherwise impede movement. This includes paralysis, slow effects,
      entanglement, Blood Puppet, Hostile Lifts, etc. All combat maneuver checks
      made to grapple the target automatically fail, and the subject
      automatically succeeds on any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist
      checks made to escape a grapple or a pin. The subject may even move and
      attack normally while underwater, provided that the weapon is wielded in
      the hand rather than hurled. This does not, however, grant
      waterbreathing.</p>
