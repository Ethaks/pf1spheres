      "value": "<p>As a standard action you may spend a spell point to remove and deconstruct your elements. This requires a melee or ranged touch attack against a target within your geomancing range. You may use the following abilities depending on what packages you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Air: Suffocation:</strong> You pull the breath from a living creature&#8217;s lungs. The target is allowed a Fortitude save to resist, and on a failure is staggered and is left unable to speak, use breath weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or perform any other action requiring breath for 1d4 rounds, +1 per 2 caster levels. If a target is unable to breathe for long enough, they may begin to suffocate, as detailed in the Gamemastery Guide.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth: Shatter:</strong> You may target an unattended, non-magical object, regardless of composition, of up to 10 lbs. per caster level and shatter it to pieces. This can be used to target objects attached to other objects (for example, a door or window), but cannot target a section of a larger object (for example, a portion of a stone wall). You may instead target a creature comprised mostly of stone or crystal; stone creatures suffer 1d6 damage per 2 caster levels while crystalline creatures suffer 1d6 damage per caster level (Fortitude half).</p>\n<p><strong>Fire: Ash Strike:</strong> You may generate a cone of ash that reaches from you to the edge of your geomancing range. This does not require a touch attack. This ash reveals invisible characters until they can wash off the ash or remove it as a full-round action (which provokes attacks of opportunity), and reveals the square invisible creatures are in if they walk on the ground, as they leave footprints in the ash. Targets struck by the ash strike must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds, or until they wash off or remove the ash as mentioned above.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal: Oxidation:</strong> You destroy a metal object or creature. If the target&#8217;s size is one or more sizes larger than the size of ore that you can recover, the creature or object takes 1d8 damage per 2 caster levels (Fortitude half), otherwise the target takes 1d8 per caster level (Fortitude half). This damage overcomes any hardness the creature or object may have. If targeting an attended object, you must pass the touch attack roll and the target is allowed a Reflex save to negate damage. If an object receives sufficient damage to destroy it, it instead becomes non-functional for 1 minute per 2 caster levels, before returning to the broken condition with 1 hit point.</p>\n<p><strong>Plant: Decompose:</strong> You cause a living target&#8217;s flesh to rot, possibly even growing mold and mushrooms. The target suffers 1d4 + 1 per 5 caster levels points of Constitution damage (Fortitude half). If a target fails their saving throw against this ability, all fast healing/magical healing/regeneration they gain is halved for 1 round per caster level (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Water: Dehydration:</strong> You suck the moisture from a living creature, causing it to suffer 1d6 nonlethal damage per caster level and become sickened for 1 round (Fortitude half). Oozes, plants, and creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes suffer lethal damage instead.</p>\n",
