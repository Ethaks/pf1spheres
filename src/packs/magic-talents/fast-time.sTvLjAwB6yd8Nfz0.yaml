    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to accelerate time within a 10-foot radius
      burst, +5 feet per 5 caster levels. All effects that are in effect within
      this area or on a creature within this area have their duration decreased
      by 1 round per caster level. This affects magic (spells, sphere abilities,
      etc.), poisons, diseases, etc., but does not grant extra actions to the
      targets within this area or provide any other benefit. In the case of
      effects that target areas, only the effect contained within Fast
      Time&#8217;s area is accelerated. Unwilling targets (including allies if
      they choose) are allowed a Will save to negate this effect for themselves
      or area effects originating from them. You can choose whether or not to
      affect yourself with your own fast time.</p>
