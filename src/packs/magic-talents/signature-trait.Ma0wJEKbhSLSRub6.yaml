      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>Choose a single Alteration sphere trait that you may select as part of
      a shapeshift. That trait reduces its spell point cost by 1 (to a minimum
      of 0) and if this reduces it to 0 it does not count as having 1 additional
      spell point cost for the purposes of your other abilities. This reduction
      in spell points does not apply to using the trait outside of casting the
      shapeshift ability (such as with the Transformation feat).</p>

      <p>This talent can be taken multiple times, selecting a different trait
      each time.</p>
