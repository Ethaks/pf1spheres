    value: >
      <p>When an enemy misses an ally with a melee attack, you may spend a spell
      point to rally that ally, allowing them to make an attack with a natural
      or manufactured weapon on the enemy that missed them. If the attack hits,
      the ally gains a +4 dodge bonus against that enemy until the end of their
      next turn. If the ally was flat-footed against the enemy, they are no
      longer flat-footed.</p>
