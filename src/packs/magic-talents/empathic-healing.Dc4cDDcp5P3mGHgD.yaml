      <p>You may restore others by taking on their injuries yourself. Doing so
      reduces the cost of the Life sphere effect by 1 spell point to a minimum
      of 0 spell points.</p>

      <p>When you restore a creature empathically, you gain any conditions you
      removed from the creature as if you had been the one originally affected.
      Likewise, you gain any attribute drain or damage, or any negative levels
      they had. You may not transfer conditions that would kill you or render
      you unconscious, or conditions that are the result of ongoing effects
      (such as being shaken within a totem of doom). You may select which
      conditions to transfer and which to leave untreated.</p>

      <p>If the effect causing the condition allowed a save, you do not get a
      new save, though any effects on you that would protect you from the
      condition still function for the duration you have them. If you already
      have that condition, any duration it may have adds to the duration of the
      condition you have, but otherwise you are unchanged.</p>

      <p>If you use this talent to restore multiple creatures, the durations of
      conditions removed stack if possible, but do not otherwise worsen.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Affliction talent, you may attempt to inflict
      others, rather than yourself, with a condition removed with the restore
      ability. You may use this ability in conjunction with restoring body or
      mind, but not soul. The target must be within range of your restore
      ability and you must succeed at a melee or ranged touch attack against
      them. Using Empathic Healing in this way increases the cost of restore by
      1 spell point rather than reduces it. If successful, the creature targeted
      must succeed at a Fortitude save or they receive all the conditions you
      just restored, except for those they are immune to.</p>

      <p>If you miss the target of your touch attack or they succeed at their
      saving throw, the restored creature is still restored. If this is used in
      conjunction with Mass Healing, multiple enemies can be targeted, but each
      enemy can only receive conditions transferred from one ally and each ally
      must have all their conditions transferred to a single target.</p>
