      <p>You may throw your telekinetic power at an object, aiding or impeding
      its natural movement. As a readied action, you may push a projectile,
      creature, thrown object, or another caster&#8217;s Bludgeon up to one size
      larger than your telekinesis limit. If aiding, you may increase a
      weapon&#8217;s range increment by half your telekinesis speed and increase
      its effective size by 1 size category +1 per 5 caster levels for the
      purposes of dealing damage and determining if another caster may Catch the
      object with their own telekinesis. If aiding a creature, you may choose to
      instead grant it an enhancement bonus to its movement equal to 1/2 your
      telekinesis speed. You may also add 1d6 damage + 1d6 per 5 caster levels
      to the falling damage a target suffers. This ability may be used to cause
      damage to a target that was successfully tripped.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may slow down a creature or object, cutting its
      movement speed in half. If the target is falling, this decreases their
      falling speed to 60 feet per round, allowing them to fall great distances
      without being hurt.</p>

      <p>When you use the Catch function of your telekinesis, you may also
      choose to deflect an object instead of Catching it, causing it to simply
      miss instead of being lifted with telekinesis. Telekinetic Push still
      requires a spell point when used directly on hostile targets, but does not
      allow a Will save to negate, even when used with Catch, due to the briefer
      contact and more indirect force. Telekinetic Pushes cannot be sustained
      with Sustained Force.</p>
