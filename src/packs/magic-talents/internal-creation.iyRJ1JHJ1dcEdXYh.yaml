      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Distant Creation
      [range], Potent Alteration).</p>

      <p>You may alter a target that you can detect (usually through divine)
      inside another object or creature or create an object that is inside
      another object or creature. The object must appear within the range of
      your alter or create ability. The creature or object (or the
      object&#8217;s owner, in the case of an attended object) is allowed a
      Fortitude save to negate this effect.</p>

      <p>When an object is created or increased in size inside a target (as a
      result of this talent, the Magnify/Minimize talent, or some other effect),
      the target and the object take twice the amount of damage they would have
      taken if the object had fallen on them from normal height (for example,
      creating a Large object inside a target would deal 4d6 damage to both
      target and object). Any other damage alterations to a created object apply
      to this damage unless they would be the result of velocity. If an object
      is not at least two sizes smaller than the object or creature it was
      altered or created in, it is immediately ejected from its vessel and lands
      in an adjacent square.</p>
