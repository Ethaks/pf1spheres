      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere (Glyph), caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>When you create a glyph, you may substitute an ability that you possess
      from another sphere in place of a ward.</p>

      <p>This ability must either target an area, or must have the ability to
      attack creatures. When triggered, the glyph activates the ability. For an
      ability with a duration, it lasts for 1 round per caster level (even if
      the original duration of the ability was longer), while an instantaneous
      ability activates once against whomever triggered the glyph, or a random
      target within range if that is not applicable. You must pay the full spell
      point cost of the sphere ability the glyph contains. You do not need to
      pay a spell point to maintain an effect without concentration - the glyph
      maintains the effect as if it were concentrated on. A glyph cannot discern
      automatically between allies and enemies; only those who trigger them and
      those who have not. This extends to the substitute effects which normally
      would be able to distinguish between allies and enemies.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Cantrips feat, you may use any simple magical effect
      the Cantrips feat can create (such as a simple alarm, or having an
      illusionary mouth appear and deliver a short message) with the glyph
      instead of a sphere ability. Counterspell may also be substituted for a
      sphere ability. Similarly, you may add a non-magical trap (such as those
      constructed with the Craft skill) to a glyph in place of a sphere
      ability.</p>

      <p>A complex glyph uses your caster level with the sphere of the sphere
      ability to determine the effect of the sphere ability, but uses your
      Protection caster level to determine its own properties.</p>
