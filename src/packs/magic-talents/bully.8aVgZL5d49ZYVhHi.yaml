      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charge:</strong> Choose one natural attack the target
      possesses. When charging, that attack deals damage as if it were one size
      larger and receives 1-1/2 times the target&#8217;s Strength bonus to
      damage instead of 1 times.</p>

      <p><strong>Push/Pull:</strong> Choose one natural attack the target
      possesses. On a successful attack against a creature of equal or smaller
      size, the target may attempt a bull rush, drag, or reposition check as a
      free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
