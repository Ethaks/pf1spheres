    value: >
      <p>You may alter an object&#8217;s size for 1 minute per caster level.
      When using alter you may cause any object you may affect to increase or
      decrease by 1 size category. This doubles or halves the object&#8217;s
      height and width and multiplies or divides its weight by 8.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point, you can increase the number of steps you may
      enlarge or shrink an object by 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels (to a maximum of
      Colossal and a minimum of Fine). Effects which depend upon a target
      object&#8217;s size which would not function due to size alterations are
      automatically suppressed, continuing to count down their duration as
      normal, when the object no longer meets the size requirements.</p>

      <p>Worn items affected by Magnify/Minimize impede their wearer. Magical
      armor and clothing made too large or small make movement difficult and
      treat the wearer as if they were encumbered with a heavy load. Non-magical
      worn equipment made too small forces the wearer to attempt a Strength
      check (with a +2 bonus per size category change of the equipment) against
      the Break DC of the object. Success destroys the object while failure
      results in encumbrance as if it was a magical item. Non-magical equipment
      made too large may encumber the target or simply fall to the ground if
      made 2 or more sizes too large. Other effects of similar severity may
      occur at the GM&#8217;s discretion.</p>

      <p>If cast on a qualifying creature using Potent Alteration, the target
      creature gains the same adjustments as if the Size Change Alteration
      talent had been used on them to adjust them to the target size.</p>
