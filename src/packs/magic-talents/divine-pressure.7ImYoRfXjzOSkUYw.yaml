    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to fill an area with an enduring presence
      of an alignment you possess (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful).</p>

      <p>Any creature of that alignment&#8217;s opposite (good for evil, lawful
      for chaotic, etc.) who enters or begins their turn inside the consecration
      must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer one of the following
      conditions: deafened, exhausted, or sickened (chosen at the time of
      casting). Creatures who fail their saving throw remain under the effects
      of the condition until they leave the area of the consecration or the
      consecration ends.</p>

      <p>As this power is cosmic in origin, it can affect undead and constructs,
      even though they are usually immune to effects requiring a Fortitude
      saving throw. If you are true neutral, you may choose neutrality with this
      consecration, in which case all creatures at the extremes of the alignment
      spectrum (chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good) suffer
      the ill effects.</p>

      <p>You must concentrate to maintain this consecration. You may always
      spend an additional spell point as a free action to allow this
      consecration to continue for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration.</p>
