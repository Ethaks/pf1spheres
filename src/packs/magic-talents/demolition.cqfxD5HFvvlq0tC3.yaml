    value: >
      <p>You can tune your destructive blast more towards inanimate objects
      rather than creatures. When you use your destructive blast this way, you
      deal +1 damage per die and deal full damage to objects, ignoring any
      reduction that would normally apply from being an energy attack, ranged
      attack, ineffective weapon type, or similar effect, though hardness still
      applies. Anything other than an inanimate object struck by this kind of
      destructive blast only takes half damage from it.</p>
