      <p>A (succor) talent allows you to create an effect by sacrificing an
      aegis you created. This is an immediate action that can be performed using
      any aegis you created that you have line of effect to. The resulting
      effect occurs to the creature that bore the aegis. These talents require
      line of sight, but otherwise have unlimited range.</p>
