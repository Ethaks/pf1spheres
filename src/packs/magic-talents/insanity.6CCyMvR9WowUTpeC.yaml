      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Confusion (charm)), caster
      level 10th.</p>

      <p>When applying a Confusion charm to a target, you may spend an
      additional spell point to change this charm into an instantaneous effect.
      The charm has no duration and cannot be dispelled. This cannot be removed
      except through the Make Whole advanced Life talent or through a similar
      effect such as a greater restoration spell.</p>
