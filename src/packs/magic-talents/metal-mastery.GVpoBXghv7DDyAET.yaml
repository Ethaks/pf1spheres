      <p>Whenever you use Recover Ore, you gain the ability to Recover Ore of
      iron, lead, or steel. Upon reaching caster level 5th, you add cold iron
      and silver to the types of ore you may recover. At caster level 10th, you
      gain the ability to recover mithral ore.</p>

      <p>When using Magnetize, you may also affect the metal object with Reforge
      with the same action, spending a spell point to transform the metal object
      into a more dangerous form. The object may take the form of a specific
      weapon of your choice, or simply into a dangerous form which deals
      bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage and deals double the ore damage
      normal for its size.</p>

      <p>You also gain the following geomancing ability:</p>

      <p><strong>Fortify:</strong> Instantaneous. You may spend 2 spell points
      as a standard action to fortify an unattended object (even non-metal
      objects) within range. The target becomes fused with metal, permanently
      increasing or decreasing the hardness and AC of the object by 1, +1 per 5
      caster levels. An object may only be under the effects of one fortify at a
      time, as each future casting dismisses and replaces the previous casting.
      This grants no further benefit or penalties due to the metals used.</p>
