      <p>Your geomancing abilities can now affect greater depths and heights;
      rocks fly, vines reach, and fire blazes in such a way as to affect
      creatures at much higher or lower elevations than normal.</p>

      <p>When using Entangle or Tremor, you may affect flying creatures up to 10
      feet per caster level over the effect. Affected creatures must succeed at
      a Fly check (DC 15 + caster level) or fall; Entangle pulls targets
      harmlessly to the ground and entangles them as normal, while Tremor causes
      targets to suffer falling damage.</p>

      <p>When creating a Vortex, increase the height to 10 feet + 10 feet per
      caster level. The top of the vortex is 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels wide, though the base of the vortex is still 5 feet.</p>

      <p>When using Affect Fire, you may cause the fire to manifest as a pillar,
      reaching 10 feet per caster level into the air.</p>

      <p>When using Gust Of Wind you may create the gust as a column with a
      radius of 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels and a height of 10 feet per
      caster level, centered anywhere within your geomancing range.</p>

      <p>When using Magnetize, double the range you can target.</p>
