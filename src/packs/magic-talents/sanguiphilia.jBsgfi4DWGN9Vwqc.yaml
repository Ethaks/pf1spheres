      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere (Martyr&#8217;s Tithings
      (blood art)), caster level 7th.</p>

      <p>Whenever you would gain temporary hit points from the Martyr&#8217;s
      Tithings talent due to another creature suffering blood loss, you may
      instead choose to heal an amount of damage equal to the number of
      temporary hit points you would gain. If you possess a Life sphere
      (vitality) talent, you may treat temporary hit points gained with the
      Martyr&#8217;s Tithings talent or healing granted by this talent as though
      it were a Life sphere effect for the purposes of granting the benefits of
      a (vitality) talent.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may treat bleed damage another creature takes during
      their turn within your Blood sphere range as though it were blood loss
      caused by your effects (to a maximum of 1/2 your Blood sphere caster
      level).</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a Blood sphere caster level of 10, a
      monster taking 12 bleed damage would be treated as though it suffered 5
      points of blood loss, granting the Blood sphere caster 5 temporary hit
      points from the Martyr&#8217;s Tithings talent.</p>
