      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Expanded Materials (material), Lengthened Creation; (Change Material (alter), Expanded Materials (material), Forge (alter), Permanent Change (advanced)) or Create Materials (advanced)), caster level 15th.</p>\n<p>You may spend 5 additional spell points when using Create Materials or Permanent Change to permanently create valuable raw materials, including gems, precious metals (such as gold or silver), and rare metals (such as cold iron or mithral). When using this talent your caster level is halved for determining the quantity of material that can be created.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This talent can be unbalancing for a game, and GMs should consider its role in their setting before allowing it to fall into player hands. However, if handled correctly, this talent can lead to interesting interactions between players and setting. For example, the players might flood a market with rare jewels only to find their value plummets as the market floods. This applies to the selling of a mass amount of mithral or adamantine as well. Also remember that towns have a maximum buy value and attempting to sell items that exceed this value cannot be done.</p>\n<p>Additionally take note of how this talent could affect the world at large outside of PC hands. If many high level Creation casters exist, then normally rare materials might be commonplace in the setting, their rarity long since diminished by industrious casters, or perhaps the materials are not naturally occurring at all and the few mages with the ability to create them charge a fortune for their use, keeping their prices high. This ultimate secret of Creation might even be passed down only among those of a certain order, limiting the talent&#8217;s availability to a select few, like medieval guilds, with well guarded, secret recipes whose methods could be lost.</p>\n",
