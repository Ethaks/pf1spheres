    value: >
      <p>You bend the edges of an area, bounding it with your magic and trapping
      creatures inside. The bounded area measures one 10-foot cube, and you may
      increase the area by an additional 10-foot cube per 5 caster levels,
      arranged as you wish so long as the entire area is contiguous. Anyone
      inside the area must succeed on a Will save to move out of the area. On a
      failed save, they instead move to the opposite face of the area and must
      wait until their next turn to attempt to leave it again. This does not
      prevent attacks across the boundary in either direction, and creatures may
      enter the area without difficulty. This area lasts as long as you
      concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1
      round per caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>If you also possess Plane Manipulator, you may spend a spell point to
      apply its dimensional anchor effect to the area of your looped space,
      contesting teleportation and planar travel to a magical skill check.</p>
