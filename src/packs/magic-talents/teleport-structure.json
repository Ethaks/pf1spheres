You may teleport any object of appropriate size, shown on the Structure Table below. If you use Mass Teleport in conjunction with this talent, a teleported object counts as a creature in the affected group for the purposes of who may be included within the Mass Teleport.</p>\n<p>If you use Group Teleport in conjunction with this talent, you may teleport all targets touching a teleported object or structure instead of teleporting all creatures within Ranged Warp range. You must use Unwilling Teleport to teleport any unwilling creatures on the object or structure.</p>\n<strong>Table: Structure</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caster Level</th>\n<th>Maximum Size</th>\n<th>Example Object</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Barrel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Table</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>Wagon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>Catapult</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>Ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25th</td>\n<td>Colossal+</td>\n<td>Tavern</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30th</td>\n<td>Colossal++</td>\n<td>Castle</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h5 id=\"toc59\"><span>Warping Structures (Store and Teleport Structure)</span></h5>\n<p>A vehicle or building that is occupied is counted as attended or in a creature's possession, preventing it from being teleported or stored unless all occupying creatures are willing and/or helpless, or targeted with Unwilling Teleport.</p>\n<p>Some large structures, such as a castle, are arguably made up of a multitude of smaller structures, but can be counted as a single structure for this purpose as long as they are conceptually a single unit.</p>\n<p>Finally, the contents of a structure are moved with it as if they were part of the object, so long as the contents can fit comfortably inside (this, hay inside a wagon would work, but an enormous dragon's corpse across the top would not).</p>\n",
