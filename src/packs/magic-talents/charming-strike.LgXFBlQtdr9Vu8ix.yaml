    value: >
      <p>You may deliver charms via a melee touch attack. As a standard action,
      you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with using a charm.
      This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged attack.
      If the target is struck by the attack, it is also affected by the charm.
      If using a scatter weapon, the charm only applies to a single target,
      chosen at the time of attack.</p>
