    value: >
      <p>Your companion can shock others, like an electric eel. As a standard
      action, your companion may make a melee touch attack that deals 1d8 plus
      1d8 per 2 Hit Dice electricity damage. This touch attack does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. If a creature successfully grapples this
      companion, the companion may use this ability as an immediate action,
      inflicting the damage with no attack roll, but allowing a Fortitude saving
      throw for half damage. If this companion is in water, this ability instead
      functions as a 10-foot radius burst centered on the companion; affected
      creatures are allowed a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Creatures
      beyond 10-foot but within a 30-foot radius takes half damage, with a
      Fortitude save for half damage. Once used, this ability cannot be used
      again for 1d4 rounds.</p>
