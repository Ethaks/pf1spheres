      <p>You cause time to move at an unnatural pace around the target for as
      long as you concentrate, jumping and skipping in distorted shudders unless
      they succeed at a Will saving throw. Targets who fail their saving throw
      take a penalty on all skill checks and attack rolls equal to 1/2 your
      caster level and must succeed on a concentration check against your MSD to
      cast a spell; failing this concentration check means the spell fails and
      the effort is wasted. You may spend a spell point to allow this effect to
      continue for 1 round per caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>Creatures affected by this ability may attempt a new Will saving throw
      as a free action once each round to attempt to end its effects.</p>
