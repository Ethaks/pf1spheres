This requires a magical skill check against the disease&#8217;s save DC. Unwilling targets are allowed a Fortitude save to negate this effect. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if the target is suffering bleed damage or below one half its maximum hit points.</p>\n<p>As a (quicken) ability, you may spend a spell point to force a creature suffering from a disease to roll a save against that disease. Success on this save does not count toward curing the disease and failing progresses the disease.</p>\n<p>As a (still) ability, you may immediately grant a save to a creature suffering from a disease. Success on this save counts toward curing the disease but failing has no effect. A creature may not be the target of this use more than once per day.</p>\n<p>As a (still) ability, you may delay the onset of a disease and to delay any saves forced by the disease for the duration of your blood control, though at least 1 save against the disease must be attempted every 2 days. This does not remove any penalties already inflicted by the disease, it only prevents the disease from progressing.</p>\n",
