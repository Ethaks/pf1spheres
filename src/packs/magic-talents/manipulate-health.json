      "value": "<p>As a free action, you may ascertain the general condition of any creature under the effects of your blood control according to the list below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Normal:</strong> Has at least 90% of full normal hit points, free of disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Fair:</strong> 30% to 90% of full normal hit points remaining.</li>\n<li><strong>Poor:</strong> Less than 30% of full normal hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury.</li>\n<li><strong>Weak:</strong> 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease that has reduced an ability score to 5 or less, or crippled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also know if the creature is suffering from any bleed effects.</p>\n<p>As a (quicken) ability, you may spend a spell point to attempt to force a disease out of the target&#8217;s body. This requires a magical skill check against the disease&#8217;s save DC. Unwilling targets are allowed a Fortitude save to negate this effect. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if the target is suffering bleed damage or below one half its maximum hit points.</p>\n<p>As a (quicken) ability, you may spend a spell point to force a creature suffering from a disease to roll a save against that disease. Success on this save does not count toward curing the disease and failing progresses the disease.</p>\n<p>As a (still) ability, you may immediately grant a save to a creature suffering from a disease. Success on this save counts toward curing the disease but failing has no effect. A creature may not be the target of this use more than once per day.</p>\n<p>As a (still) ability, you may delay the onset of a disease and to delay any saves forced by the disease for the duration of your blood control, though at least 1 save against the disease must be attempted every 2 days. This does not remove any penalties already inflicted by the disease, it only prevents the disease from progressing.</p>\n",
