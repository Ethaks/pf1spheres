      <p>When you create an object, you may work with any non-harmful material
      with a hardness of 5 or less, including glass, ice, or leather. You may
      create water (3 cubic feet equals a Small creature), but not gases or
      flesh. As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to steadily
      make more materials, as detailed in the table below. When creating objects
      made from stone, gems, or metal, double the maximum weight per size
      category of the objects you can create.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Objects of stone or harder materials deal double
      damage when dropped on a target.</p>

      <p><strong>Slippery Ice:</strong> You may create hazardous ground made
      from slick ice, as detailed under the Freeze ability from the <a
      href="/nature">Nature</a> sphere.</p>
