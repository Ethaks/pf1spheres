      <p>You inspire the target to great action.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> The target may choose one attack roll,
      saving throw, ability check, or skill check it makes within the next
      minute. The target gains a morale bonus equal to 2 + 1 per 5 caster levels
      on that roll. If no roll is selected before 1 minute passes, this effect
      ends.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> The target gains a morale bonus equal
      to 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels to all attack rolls, saving throws, ability
      checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This is the same as the greater charm,
      except the target also becomes immune to fear and gains temporary hit
      points equal to your caster level.</p>
