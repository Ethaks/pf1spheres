      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Distant Teleport, Flawless
      Teleport (advanced), True Teleport (advanced), Unseeing Teleport), caster
      level 17th.</p>

      <p>When using True Teleport, your range becomes truly unlimited; you can
      even teleport between planets if you so choose.</p>

      <p>You must have a solid grasp of which world you wish to travel to
      (&#8220;the third planet from the sun&#8221; is an acceptable destination,
      but &#8220;a habitable world near that bright star&#8221; is not). If you
      have a specific location on a planet in mind, you arrive there without a
      chance of failure; otherwise you arrive at a location that would not
      immediately be life-threatening. If no such safe landing zone exists on
      the world, such as someone attempting to travel into the sun without the
      proper precautions in place, the teleport simply fails.</p>
