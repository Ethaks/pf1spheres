      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere (Deep Nature), caster
      level 10th.</p>

      <p>As an instantaneous effect you may spend 10 minutes and 3 spell points
      to target a portion of material within close range from one of your
      packages to create a correlating elemental. For these purposes, the
      Weather sphere counts as a Nature package. The (plant) package, rather
      than producing an elemental, instead creates a treant.</p>

      <p>The creature created is friendly toward you, and while you have no
      special empathy or connection with it, the creature serves you in specific
      tasks or endeavors if you communicate your desires to it. However, as it
      is a living, intelligent being, it will expect good treatment in return.
      If you use Zoetic Geomancy again, any previously created creatures remain
      friendly to you, but they no longer undertake tasks for you unless it is
      in their best interests.</p>
