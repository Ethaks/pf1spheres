      <p>If you are of good alignment, you may spend a spell point to make your
      destructive blast deal sacred damage. If you are of evil alignment, you
      may spend a spell point to have your destructive blast deal profane
      damage. You cannot use this blast type if you are of neither
      alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Sacred damage comes from attacks that are
      heavily infused with the power of sheer good and carry this holy power
      over as a form of harmful energy to evil-aligned beings. Sacred damage
      deals full damage to incorporeal targets, and deals damage as if the
      weapon were good-aligned. As it is not a weapon damage type, it
      automatically bypasses all damage reduction.</p>

      <p>Profane damage comes from attacks that are heavily infused with the
      power of sheer evil and carry this unholy power over as a form of harmful
      energy to good-aligned beings. Profane damage deals full damage to
      incorporeal targets and deals damage as if the weapon were evil-aligned.
      As it is not a weapon damage type, it automatically bypasses all damage
      reduction.</p>
