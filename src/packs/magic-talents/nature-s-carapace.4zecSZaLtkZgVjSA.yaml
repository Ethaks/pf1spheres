      <p>You may spend a spell point as a move action to wrap an element around
      yourself for 1 minute per caster level. This allows you to grant yourself
      one of the benefits outlined below, dependent on the packages you
      possess:</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Buffeting Winds:</strong> You gain a 10% miss chance vs.
      ranged attacks, +10% per 5 caster levels. This does not affect ranged
      weapons that are unusually massive, such as boulders or siege weapons.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Stoneskin:</strong> You gain DR/adamantine equal to 1/2
      your caster level. Once this has absorbed damage equal to 10 per caster
      level, it immediately ends even if its duration has not expired.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire: Flame Mantle:</strong> You place fire around yourself as
      a mantle. This does not deal fire damage to yourself, but all adjacent
      creatures take fire damage equal to the largest fire you can create at the
      end of each of your turns, and must succeed at a Reflex save or catch
      fire.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal: Iron Body:</strong> You wrap yourself in thick iron. You
      count as a creature comprised mostly of metal and gain a +6 armor bonus
      and a -3 armor check penalty, both of which increase by 1 per 4 caster
      levels, and you are considered to be wearing heavy armor, such as when
      calculating movement speed. You are considered armed when making unarmed
      attacks, and gain a +2 bonus to Strength and a -2 penalty to Dexterity,
      both of which increase by 2 for every 8 caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Barkskin:</strong> You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to
      natural armor, +1 per 5 caster levels. In addition, in natural
      environments you gain a circumstance bonus to Stealth equal to 1/2 your
      caster level (minimum 1). You lose this circumstance bonus to Stealth in
      any round that you move more than 5 feet.</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Seamantle:</strong> You wrap water around yourself,
      gaining a circumstance bonus to Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver
      checks made to escape a grapple, as well as to your CMD to avoid being
      grappled, equal to your caster level. Additionally, the distortion from
      the water grants you a 10% chance to negate critical hits and precision
      damage, +10% per 5 caster levels.</p>
