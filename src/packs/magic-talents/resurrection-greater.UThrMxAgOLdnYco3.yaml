      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere (Break Enchantment, Make
      Whole (advanced), Restore Senses (cure), Restore Spirit (cure),
      Resurrection (advanced), Resuscitate), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When you bring a target back to life with your Resurrection talent,
      they only suffer 1 permanent negative level, they may have been dead for
      up to 10 years per caster level, and they can be missing vital components;
      indeed, you need only a small piece of their body (a pinch of ash, a
      finger, etc.) to bring them back to life and fully restore their body to
      its complete form.</p>
