    value: >
      <p>By spending 2 additional spell points you may use your (expunge)
      talents in an area, targeting every creature within a 15-foot radius burst
      centered within your expunge range. If the ability requires a magic skill
      check or attack roll, make a single roll and compare it to the magic skill
      defense of every creature affected. Otherwise, they each roll their save
      as normal. The caster is unaffected by this ability if they are within the
      area of effect.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Magical Conduit talent, you can create a manabond
      with all creatures affected by this talent; otherwise, you may only create
      a manabond with one.</p>
