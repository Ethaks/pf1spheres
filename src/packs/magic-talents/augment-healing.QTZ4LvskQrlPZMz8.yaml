      <p>When you use Haste or Slow on a creature (or group of creatures, such
      as with the Mass Time talent), you may spend an extra spell point to
      augment the natural healing abilities of all affected targets. With Haste,
      you can grant them fast healing equal to 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels you
      possess for the duration of the effect.</p>

      <p>With Slow, you can suspend the target&#8217;s natural healing
      abilities, preventing any fast healing or regeneration they may possess
      for the duration of the effect. Magical or extraordinary healing from
      other sources continues to function as normal. A creature whose
      regeneration cannot be suppressed or ignored (such as the tarrasque) is
      immune to this effect.</p>
