      <p>When using a lens, you may spend an additional spell point to affect an
      additional 1 creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) with the same lens
      at the same time. Each target must be within range. While you may maintain
      concentration on each lens at the same time, each lens is considered a
      separate sphere effect. When spending a spell point to allow the lenses to
      endure without concentration, the duration of each lens is decreased by
      one step to 10 minutes per caster level.</p>
