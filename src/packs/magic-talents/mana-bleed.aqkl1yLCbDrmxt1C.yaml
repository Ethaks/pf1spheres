      <p>As a swift action, you may force a creature under the effects of your
      blood control and taking bleed damage to lose 1 spell point. This loss
      increases by one die size (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.) for every five caster
      levels. Creatures that possess spell slots instead lose spell slots, based
      on the level of the slot. Each slot is equivalent to a number of spell
      points: level 1-2: 1 spell point, 3-5: 2 spell points, 6-8: 3 spell
      points, 9: 4 spell points. The target creature chooses which spell slots
      are lost. If affecting a creature with psionic manifesting (see Psionics
      Unleashed by Dreamscarred Press), the creature loses a number of power
      points equal to the number of spell points that would have been lost
      multiplied by 1 + its Hit Dice/4.</p>

      <p>If you possess Absorb Blood, you may choose to grant an equal number of
      temporary spell points to a creature receiving healing from Absorb Blood,
      though they cannot receive more spell points than your target loses. These
      temporary spell points do not stack with spell points from other targets,
      other instances of this ability, or any other source and expire after one
      round per caster level. This ability does not grant a way to use spell
      points to those that lack one.</p>
