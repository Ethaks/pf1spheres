    value: >
      <p>You tamper with a mind&#8217;s language center, and the muscles
      controlling speech to impede or alter the flow of words. Will save
      negates.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You can tug on the strings of
      conversation, altering the sounds of words, inserting or negating
      vocalizations as you see fit. You may impose a failure chance on any other
      magic user whose magic requires a verbal component equal to 10% + an
      additional 5% for every 5 caster levels (this effect stacks with similar
      failure chances, such as the 20% chance that accompanies the deafened
      condition). In addition, you may impose a circumstance bonus or penalty to
      the target&#8217;s Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform checks equal
      to 2 + 1 per every 5 caster levels. This effect lasts for a number of
      minutes equal to your caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the
      lesser charm, you may wrest full control from a target&#8217;s speech by
      stopping them from speaking entirely or choosing words for them to say.
      This can prevent a target from using magic that requires verbal components
      or other vocalizations, and can force a target that remains within range
      to only say what you want them to say. A target not specifically under the
      mental command to remain silent will be able to say whatever it wishes if
      it leaves the range of the effect. If you attempt to make a target say
      something that would be against the target&#8217;s nature (such as a young
      lover renouncing affection for his or her betrothed, or a dragon agreeing
      to a verbal contract to part with some of its treasure), it gains another
      Will save to resist the effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> Your control over the speech of the
      target is fluid and nearly flawless. In addition to the effects of the
      lesser and greater charms, you may make the target speak so eloquently
      that you may roll a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform check through
      them using your own ranks instead of its own, provided that the check in
      question is vocal in nature. You may also make use of the target&#8217;s
      ranks in these skills yourself, borrowing the talent or, if you wish,
      allowing the target to directly speak through you. You may also use magic
      that requires verbal components (but no other components) through the
      target, as if the magic originated from the target&#8217;s space. Casters
      with the Gestures talent may include somatic components with no extra save
      required.</p>
