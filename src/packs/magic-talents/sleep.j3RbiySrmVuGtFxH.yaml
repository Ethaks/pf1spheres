      <p>You put the target to sleep.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You make the target lethargic, making it
      staggered for 1d4 rounds (Will negates).</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> You put the target to sleep for 1
      minute per caster level (Will negates). Targets who take damage
      automatically wake up, and other creatures may wake a sleeping creature as
      a standard action (an application of the aid another action).</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> The target is placed into a deeper
      slumber. Whenever the sleeping target takes damage or another creature
      attempts to wake it as a standard action, the target does not
      automatically awaken, but instead attempts a new Will save to wake up with
      a +4 bonus.</p>
