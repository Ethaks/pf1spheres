      <p>Your cure ability heals an additional 1 hit point per caster level.
      When restoring a target&#8217;s soul, the target is cured of all ability
      damage, as well as all ability drain to one ability score of your choice.
      The target is also cured of 1 temporary negative level, +1 per 5 caster
      levels. This may also suppress a permanent negative level for 1 minute per
      caster level instead of curing a temporary negative level.</p>
