      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Shadowed Mien (shadow)),
      caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>By spending an additional spell point you may render your shadowed mien
      entirely opaque, protecting the target from harm from daylight, magical or
      normal, and granting a bonus equal to your caster level on saves against
      light, pattern, and vision-based effects. You are always treated as having
      your eyes averted with respect to gaze attacks, though you suffer none of
      the associated penalties. Creatures with extreme vulnerability to
      daylight, such as vampires and shadow demons, are protected from daylight
      by this talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This talent may be used on creatures
      which do not cast a shadow (such as vampires or other creatures with the
      shadowless ability) that otherwise could not be targeted by (shadow)
      talents. At GM's discretion, this talent may be allowed to suppresses a
      creature's shadowless ability, causing the creature to cast a shadow and
      be able to be affected by other (shadow) talents or effects which interact
      with a creature's shadow.</p>
