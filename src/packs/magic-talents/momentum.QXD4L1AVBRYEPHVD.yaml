      <p>Talents marked (momentum) grant you a momentum pool, as well as a
      method of using it.</p>

      <p>If you have at least one (momentum) talent, you can spend a spell point
      as a standard action to gain a momentum pool. This pool lasts 1 hour per
      caster level, and holds a number of points of momentum equal to the War
      caster&#8217;s caster level plus their casting ability modifier. Using
      this ability again refills your momentum pool; it does not create
      additional pools.</p>

      <p>Allies within 30 feet of you can spend points of momentum from this
      pool to activate any ability from any of your (momentum) talents (using a
      (momentum) talent spends momentum points, not spell points). All of your
      (momentum) talents draw from the same pool, and using momentum is not
      considered a sphere ability and does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.</p>

      <p>The caster level associated with the momentum pools is that of the
      caster when they last filled their pool. Being knocked unconscious or made
      helpless makes the momentum pool inaccessible until you are conscious
      again.</p>
