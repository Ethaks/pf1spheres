      <p>If you are of lawful alignment, you may spend a spell point to make
      your destructive blast deal axiomatic damage. If you are of chaotic
      alignment, you may spend a spell point to have your destructive blast deal
      anarchic damage. You cannot use this blast type if you are of neither
      alignment.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Axiomatic damage comes from attacks that are
      heavily infused with the power of sheer law and carry this orderly power
      over as a form of harmful energy to chaos-aligned beings. Axiomatic damage
      deals full damage to incorporeal targets, and deals damage as if the
      weapon were law-aligned. As it is not a weapon damage type, it
      automatically bypasses all damage reduction.</p>

      <p>Anarchic damage comes from attacks that are heavily infused with the
      power of sheer chaos and carry this disorderly power over as a form of
      harmful energy to law-aligned beings. Anarchic damage deals full damage to
      incorporeal targets and deals damage as if the weapon were chaos-aligned.
      As it is not a weapon damage type, it automatically bypasses all damage
      reduction.</p>
