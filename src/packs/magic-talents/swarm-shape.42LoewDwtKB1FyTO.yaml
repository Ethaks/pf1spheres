      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Divided Self:</strong> The target gains a +4 bonus on saves
      against effects that target individual creatures. (Requires the Swarm
      trait)</p>

      <p><strong>Gaseous Body:</strong> You grant the target the ability to
      shift into or out of a gas-like form (e.g. fine mist, a cloud of insects,
      etc.) as a move action. While in this gas-like form, the target gains a
      fly speed of 10 feet with maneuverability (perfect), +5 feet per 5 caster
      levels, replacing all other movement the target may possess. Anything the
      target was wearing or holding transforms with the target, and the target
      loses its armor and natural armor bonuses. The target cannot manipulate or
      interact with objects, make attacks, speak, or cast spells with verbal,
      somatic, or focus components (unless the target possesses an ability to do
      so, such as the Silent Spell metamagic feat). Any traits or supernatural
      abilities the target possesses which alter or require its physical body
      are suppressed, including Alteration sphere traits. The target can pass
      through small holes, narrow openings, and even cracks. The target is still
      subject to the effects of wind and cannot enter water or other liquid.
      Granting this trait costs an additional spell point. [Gravecaller's
      HB]</p>

      <p><strong>Swarm:</strong> You may spend a spell point to turn the target
      into a swarm of creatures. The swarm can be composed only of Tiny
      creatures, with appearance and movement per the shapeshift. This size
      cannot be altered by the Size Change trait, enlarge person, or other
      effects. This does not affect the target&#8217;s movement modes. The
      target can move through small holes and openings that are large enough for
      the individual creatures. The swarm fills a 10-foot square (or cube if
      flying) and has a reach of 0. The target gains a 25% ability to ignore
      critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 5 caster
      levels to a maximum of 100%.</p>

      <p>The swarm has the distraction ability, forcing any creature that takes
      swarm damage to succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice
      + Constitution modifier or be nauseated for 1 round. Spellcasting or
      concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a magical
      skill check (DC 20 + 1/2 caster level). Using skills that involve patience
      and concentration while in the swarm requires a DC 20 Will save. The
      target may choose to ignore any creatures in its space, choosing to not
      deal the swarm damage, force magical skill checks to cast spells, or force
      Will saves to skills.</p>

      <p>The swarm form is incapable of performing combat maneuvers and they
      cannot be bull rushed, dragged, grappled, repositioned, or tripped.
      Creatures in swarm form take 50% more damage from effects that affect an
      area. Creatures in swarm form do not threaten creatures, and do not make
      attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. The swarm automatically
      deals 1d6 + Constitution modifier damage to any creature whose space it
      occupies at the end of its turn. This damage increases by 1d6 per 5 caster
      levels and may be modified by traits that require a natural attack (such
      as the Poison trait from the Vermin Transformation talent) but not those
      that modify natural attacks (such as the Powerful Claws trait from the
      Powerful Limbs talent). A creature that retains a natural attack (such as
      a shifter via a bestial trait) or is granted a natural attack by another
      trait cannot use it, but uses d8 for its swarm damage. Swarm attacks are
      not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover.</p>
