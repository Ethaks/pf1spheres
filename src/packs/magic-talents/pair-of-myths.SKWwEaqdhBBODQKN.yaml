      <p>By spending an extra spell point you can simultaneously apply two
      motifs you possess to a target. The effects of each talent are resolved
      separately and the durations are tracked separately. You must pay the
      motifs&#8217; spell point costs, although other costs (such as for
      metamagic) are only incurred once.</p>
