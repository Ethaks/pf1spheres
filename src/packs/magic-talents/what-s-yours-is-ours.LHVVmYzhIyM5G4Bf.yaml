      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mana sphere (Soulmate (manabond)),
      caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>When you create a manabond using the Soulmate talent, whenever the
      recipient of this manabond benefits from magical healing, a consumable
      item (such as a potion, alchemical item, etc.), or food, you may choose to
      clone the benefits of that effect for yourself, as though you were the
      target of that effect. You may not redirect effects shared to you by the
      recipient of this bond to other creatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> The benefits of food shared by this effect
      can allow one creature to eat, and two to benefit.</p>
