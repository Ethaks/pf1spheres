      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere (Bestow Intelligence
      (enhance)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use a non-instantaneous sphere ability, you may spend 2
      spell points to give it the Embodiment of Magic template instead of
      casting it normally; if you do so, it is initially friendly towards you,
      and will die at the end of the effect&#8217;s duration.</p>

      <p>If you also possess Bestow Life, you may use it on creatures created
      through this talent; doing so increases their potency by 3, and prevents
      them from dying at the end of the effect&#8217;s duration.</p>
