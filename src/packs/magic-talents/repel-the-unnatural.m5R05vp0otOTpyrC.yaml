      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Plane Manipulator
      (space)).</p>

      <p>You may treat aberrations and oozes as if they were extraplanar
      creatures for the purpose of your Plane Manipulator talent, banishing them
      back to where they came. This effect sends the creature to the place on
      the Material Plane from which it originated (which may be an underground
      cavern, a laboratory, or another planet somewhere in the stars).</p>
