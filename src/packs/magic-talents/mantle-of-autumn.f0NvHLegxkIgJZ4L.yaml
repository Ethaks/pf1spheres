      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Cloak of Leaves:</strong> You may surround yourself in swirling
      leaves in a 10-foot radius as a move action. This radius increases by 5
      feet at 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter. All allied
      creatures fully within this area gain concealment (attacks against them
      have a 20% miss chance). If hostile creatures within this area attack
      creatures outside this area, the targets also have concealment. You may
      end this effect as a free action. Doing so removes the leaves at the end
      of your turn but does not end the fey-blessing; you may create and dismiss
      the cloak of leaves for the duration of the fey-blessing.</p>

      <p><strong>Touch of the Harvest:</strong> You may touch food-producing
      plants, causing them to sprout food spontaneously. You may touch a plant
      within your natural reach as a move action. Each plant produces enough
      food to provide 3 Medium-sized creatures or 1 horse with food for a day.
      This fey-blessing ends after you touch a number of plants equal to your
      caster level. This ability requires requires fruit trees, berry bushes, or
      food crops.</p>
