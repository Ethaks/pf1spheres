      <p>Within the area of this ward, attempts to conceal, obfuscate, or
      disguise oneself are hindered. Any creature within the ward must succeed
      at a Will save or they become unable to use any abilities to disguise or
      conceal themselves. Likewise, any spell, spell-like ability, or sphere
      ability that creates illusions or makes it difficult to sense physical
      phenomena is more difficult to use. When the ward is first created, the
      user attempts a single magical skill check against every illusion or
      concealing effect created with a spell, spell-like ability, or sphere
      ability. Magic items have a MSD of 11 + their caster level and creatures
      using spell-like abilities have an MSD equal to 11 + their Hit Dice.</p>

      <p>If your check succeeds, the effect is suppressed or the magic item
      ceases to function, respectively. Time spent suppressed counts toward a
      magical effect&#8217;s total duration. Any additional attempt to create an
      illusion or concealment effect requires the caster to beat your MSD with a
      magical skill check. They must do this even if they passed their Will
      saving throw.</p>
