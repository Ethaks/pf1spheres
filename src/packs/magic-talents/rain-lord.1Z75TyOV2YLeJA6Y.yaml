      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weather sphere, caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>When using control weather to create or alter precipitation, increase
      the highest severity level you may create or alter by 1. In addition, when

      create an area up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the affected
      area that is not subject to the precipitation. Rain, snow, and storm does
      not gather over that area.</p>
