      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Giant Fortitude:</strong> The target gains the hearty toughness
      of giants. The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your
      caster level and a bonus on Fortitude saving throws equal to 1 +1 per 10
      caster levels. If the target does not take damage for one minute, the
      temporary hit points replenish. These temporary hit points are lost if the
      shapeshift ends or if the target loses this trait. [SA:EAO]</p>

      <p><strong>Rock Catching:</strong> Once per round the creature can catch a
      rock (or projectile of a similar shape) up to its size that it would
      normally be hit by. The creature must succeed at a Reflex save against a
      DC of 15 for a Small or smaller rock, +5 per size increase. (If the
      projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by
      that amount.) The creature must be aware of the attack in order to attempt
      a rock catching.</p>

      <p><strong>Rock Throwing:</strong> 2d6 Medium, 2d4 Small, this deals 1-1/2
      times Strength damage, and has a range of 20 feet + 10 feet per 2 caster
      levels.</p>
