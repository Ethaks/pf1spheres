    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that deals 1d6
      damage per 2 caster levels to the target (minimum 1d6) and grants yourself
      an equal number of temporary hit points that last 1 minute per caster
      level (Fortitude half). You cannot gain more temporary hit points in this
      manner than the subject&#8217;s current hit points + their Constitution
      score. If you strike multiple targets at once with the same vampiric
      strike (for example, through the Mass Death Magic talent) you cannot gain
      more temporary hit points than 3 per caster level (minimum 6).</p>
