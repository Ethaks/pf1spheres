      <p>As a standard action, you may cause an object or creature in medium
      range to glow for 1 minute per caster level, outlining it with light as a
      candle, which may be of any color you wish. This requires a touch attack
      or ranged touch attack, and is subject to spell resistance. The object or
      creature becomes outlined with light, giving it a -20 penalty on Stealth
      checks and negating all bonuses usually bestowed by invisibility, blink
      effects, darkness, or similar effects.</p>

      <p>As a free action, you may cause any creature or object you have caused
      to glow that is within medium range to shed light as a torch, shedding
      normal light to 20 feet and increasing the light level by one step to a
      maximum of normal for 20 feet beyond this. Reducing this light is also a
      free action.</p>

      <p>Whenever a glow effect interacts with a magical darkness effect (such
      as from the Dark sphere) the caster of the glow effect must succeed at a
      magic skill check against the MSD of the darkness effect&#8217;s caster.
      If he succeeds, the Light effect functions normally. If he fails, the Dark
      effect functions normally (outlines are swallowed, light sources are
      hampered, etc.). An area filled with normal or bright light from a glow
      effect is no longer considered an area of darkness for Dark sphere
      abilities.</p>
