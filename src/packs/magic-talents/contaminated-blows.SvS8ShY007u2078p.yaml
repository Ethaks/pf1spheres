      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere, Weather sphere
      (Radiation Lord (advanced)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Fallout of
      severity level 3 or higher, all of their melee attacks deal 1 additional
      point of acid damage plus an additional point of acid damage for every
      point of severity above level 4. Any creature damaged by the mantled
      creature&#8217;s melee attack must succeed at a Fortitude save with your
      Weather sphere&#8217;s DC or suffer the effects of low radiation. A
      creature suffering from radiation instead must succeed at a Fortitude save
      with your Weather sphere DC or have the level of radiation increased by
      one step, inflicting the new levels primary effect (to a maximum of low at
      severity 4, medium at severity 5, high at severity 6, and extreme at
      severity 7).</p>
