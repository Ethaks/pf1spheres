      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Ghost Sight (sense),
      Unhooded Sight (sense)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to gain the ability to perceive all things
      as they actually are for 1 minute per caster level using either sight,
      sound, touch, or taste/odor. If you choose sight, you see through normal
      and magical darkness, notice secret doors hidden by magic, see the exact
      locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, see
      invisible creatures or objects normally, see through illusions, and see
      the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things.</p>

      <p>Further, you can focus your vision to see into the Ethereal Plane (but
      not into extradimensional spaces). If you choose sound, you can hear
      through soundless environments and magical silence, hear the exact
      locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement effects, hear
      creatures or objects rendered inaudible by illusions, and automatically
      discern when a sound is illusory. If you choose touch or taste/odor (the
      latter two being a single sense), you discern when such sensations are
      illusory and can sense through such illusions. The range of true
      perception conferred is 120 feet.</p>

      <p>This ability does not grant the ability to perceive through solid
      objects and does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and
      the like. True Perception does not help the viewer see through mundane
      disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret doors
      hidden by mundane means. In addition, these senses do not work in
      conjunction with other viewing magic, such as Scrying or Viewing
      Divination talents.</p>

      <p>True Perception now replaces the older True Seeing talent.</p>
