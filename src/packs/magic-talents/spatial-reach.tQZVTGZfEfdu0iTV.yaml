    value: >
      <p>You can imbue a creature with magic that bridges the distance between
      them and anything they reach or move towards, contorting space to their
      benefit. The target gains a +10 feet enhancement bonus to their movement
      speed and adds 10 feet to their natural reach, though they do not threaten
      with this additional reach. Both bonuses increase by 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels. This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a
      spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration.</p>
