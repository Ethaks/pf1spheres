    value: >
      <p>The area of your totem is filled with quiet voices that distract and
      unnerve your enemies. Enemies take a -1 penalty to their concentration
      checks and Perception checks involving listening. This increases by -1 for
      every 2 caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p>This does not work against deaf enemies, or enemies in an environment
      where it is difficult to hear. The whispers also interfere with using
      abilities that require speaking - such an ability has a 10% chance of
      failing when used plus 5% per 5 caster levels, even if the user is deaf.
      Whenever a creature uses such an ability, they can attempt a Perform
      (oratory) as part of the action required to activate the ability with a DC
      of 10 + your caster level to negate this effect.</p>
