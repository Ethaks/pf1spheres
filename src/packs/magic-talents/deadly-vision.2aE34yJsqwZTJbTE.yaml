    value: >
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Vision (charm)), caster
      level 10th.</p>

      <p>As a greater charm, you may spend 2 spell points to give the target a
      vision of the most fearsome creature imaginable, pulling its subconscious
      fears into a shape before its eyes. Only the target can see this vision,
      although you may see the vague shape of the creature the target is seeing.
      The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If
      that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must
      succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. This is a fear effect.</p>
