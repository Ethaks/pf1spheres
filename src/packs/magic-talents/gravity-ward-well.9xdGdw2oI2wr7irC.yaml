      <p>As a standard action, you can create an area of gravity that either
      pulls objects in or keeps them out. Select either yourself or a spot
      within range of your telekinesis, and choose either to attract or
      repel.</p>

      <p>If you choose attract, all creatures and unattended objects of up to
      your telekinesis limit within 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels of the
      chosen spot are drawn in a straight line to the unoccupied space nearest
      to the center of the effect. Unwilling creatures are subjected to a drag
      combat maneuver using your caster level plus your casting ability modifier
      as your CMB. A creature in the area of this effect cannot move away from
      the center of the effect except by attempting the drag combat maneuver as
      a move action against a CMD equal to 10 plus your caster level plus your
      casting ability modifier, moving the indicated distance away from the
      center of the gravity well.</p>

      <p>If you choose repel, this functions the same way except creatures and
      unattended objects within the area are pushed in a straight line away from
      the center of the effect, and creatures are subjected to and perform bull
      rush combat maneuvers instead of drag combat maneuvers.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate (pulling or pushing
      creatures each round on your turn) and can be maintained with Sustained
      Force.</p>
