    value: >
      <p>As a move action, you may spend a spell point to surround yourself with
      an aura of elemental energies for a number of rounds equal to your casting
      ability modifier; any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet + 5 feet
      per 10 caster levels of you is affected by your destructive blast, though
      the damage is reduced to its minimum (so a 4d6 blast would deal 4 damage,
      or 12 with Crafted Blast). A Reflex save negates this damage. You may only
      have one aura active at a time; casting it again ends the previous
      instance.</p>
