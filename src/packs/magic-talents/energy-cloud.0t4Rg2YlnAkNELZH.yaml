      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend three spell points to make your destructive blast into a
      roiling cloud of destruction. The cloud covers a 10-foot + 5 feet per 5
      caster levels radius, is 10-foot + 5 feet per 5 caster levels tall, and is
      stationary unless directed by the caster to move as a move action, which
      it does at a rate of 20-foot + 5 feet per 2 caster levels and persists for
      1 minute per caster level. The cloud obscures vision as the fog cloud
      spell. Any creatures who begin their turn inside the cloud suffers your
      destructive blast damage. Affected creatures are allowed a Fortitude
      saving throw for half damage. You are immune to damage from your own
      cloud.</p>
