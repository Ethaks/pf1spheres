      Elements (spirit), Wreath Of Elements (spirit)), caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>In response to gaining the disabled or dying condition, as an

      to all creatures within 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. At the
      beginning of your next round, you return to life with 0 hit points and a
