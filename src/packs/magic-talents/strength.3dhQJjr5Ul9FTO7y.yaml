    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that enhances a target&#8217;s might and will.
      The target gains a +2 insight bonus to CMB and CMD, as well as to Strength
      checks and Strength-based skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for
      every 4 caster levels.</p>

      <p>When another creature attempts and fails to demoralize the target or
      targets them with a fear effect that they successfully resist, the target
      may discharge this effect to make the other creature frightened until the
      end of their next turn, or shaken for one round with a successful Will
      save.</p>
