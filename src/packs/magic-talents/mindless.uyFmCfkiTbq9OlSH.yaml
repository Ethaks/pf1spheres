    value: >
      <p>Your Conjuration sphere companion is mindless; it has no Intelligence
      score (Int &#8212;) and cannot gain any (form) talents that would increase
      its Intelligence score. It gains no feats or skill points and cannot
      speak, though it is still capable of following your simple instructions. A
      mindless companion is immune to mind-affecting effects. A mindless
      companion can receive bonus feats and skill ranks to a specific skill from
      talents such as Capable Companion and Camouflaged Companion.</p>

      <p>The companion gains an additional Hit Die at 4th caster level and every
      4 caster levels thereafter.</p>
