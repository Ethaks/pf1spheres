    value: >
      <p>Upon gaining a Conjuration sphere companion, you may select archetypes
      to apply to it. Once selected, the archetype cannot be removed from that
      companion. Each companion may have different archetypes. A companion may
      have more than one archetype as long as the archetypes do not replace or
      modify the same features or abilities.</p>

      <p>Multiple changes to the cost to summon a companion stack (so a
      companion with the familiar and puppet archetypes would have its cost to
      summon reduced by 3).</p>
