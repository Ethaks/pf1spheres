      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Destruction sphere.</p>\n<p>When you gain this blast type, select 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20 blast type talents, no more than one being from each blast type group (you may only select 20 if you possess Admixture feats, see below). You do not need to possess these blast type talents but must meet the prerequisites for any advanced blast type talents selected with this ability. Assign each of these blast types a single number which could be rolled on a d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20 with the die used corresponding to the number of talents you have selected (a d6 if you selected 6, etc.).</p>\n<p>When you use Erratic Blast, after deciding on your target(s) but before rolling attack rolls or saves, roll a die corresponding to the number of talents selected. Use the talent corresponding to the die roll result to determine the damage die, damage type and additional effects (including feats or class abilities such as Fan The Flames, Frozen To The Bone or elementalist&#8217;s favored element) to determine the effects of the destructive blast on the target(s). Erratic Blast costs a number of spell points equal to the greatest spell point cost of the blast types selected.</p>\n<p>If you possess the Admixture talent, you may choose to make the maximum possible value of the die (8 for a d8, for an example) be an admixture of two other blast types which you have selected for the talent. Roll twice more on the table, ignoring any repeat rolls or any further maximum rolls. The next two results rolled are used together as an admixture at no increased spell point cost. If you have the Greater Admixture talent, you instead roll three times and use the next three results rolled for the admixture. You cannot use the Admixture talent with an Erratic Blast.</p>\n<p>If you possess any Admixture feats, you may select any effects that you could apply to an admixture (such as ghost strikes if you possess Ghostly Admixture). As with (blast type) talents, you need not possess these talents but must meet their prerequisites.</p>\n<p>If these abilities have variable spell point costs, determine the number of spell points you would spend on each of these effects when you select them as blast types for this talent (for example, you may choose to have your Lich Strike have an effective spell point cost of 1 or 3 for the purpose of determining the cost of an Erratic Blast which incorporates it, with the ghost strike having different effects corresponding to the number of spell points spent).</p>\n<p>You can change the blast types or admixture effects selected with this talent whenever you level up.</p>\n<p>For example, Astore is an elementalist with the Admixture talent. He creates the following table to determine the effect of his destructive blast whenever he uses it. As none of the blast types he has selected cost additional spell points, he does not need to spend additional spell points to use Erratic Blast.</p>\n<strong>Table: Astore&#8217;s Erratic Blast</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>D6 result</th>\n<th>Blast type</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Nether Blast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Acid Blast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Crystal Blast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Electric Blast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Searing Blast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Roll twice and admixture both blast types, rerolling any further results of 6</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
