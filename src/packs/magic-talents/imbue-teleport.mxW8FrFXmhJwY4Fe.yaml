    value: >
      <p>When you would teleport a target, you may imbue them with the ability
      to teleport instead of immediately teleporting them. The imbued target
      gains the ability to teleport itself once with the same details (such as
      caster level, talents, spell point expenditures) as you used with the
      original casting. However, the target may only teleport themselves and not
      others.</p>

      <p>The imbued teleport remains for 1 hour per caster level, or until used
      once. You may maintain one imbued teleport at a time, plus an additional
      imbued teleport for each five caster levels you possess.</p>
