      <p>You grant the form of a flying animal or magical beast with your
      shapeshift.<br>

      <strong>Limbs:</strong> 1 head, 2 legs, 2 wings<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> No; <strong>Hands:</strong> No<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft. land speed, 30 ft. glide speed (the target
      takes no damage when falling and may glide, moving with a speed of 30 ft.
      with maneuverability (poor), but falling 1 ft. for every 5 ft. traveled.).
      At 5th caster level, the target gains a fly speed of 40 ft. with
      maneuverability (average). This improves by +20 ft. per 5 additional
      caster levels, and one maneuverability category per 10 additional caster
      levels.<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> 2 talons (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3
      Small)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft.</p>

      <p>Avian Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply
      to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Two talon attacks as those granted by Avian Transformation. This may
      be granted once per pair of legs the creature possesses. The target must
      possess wings or another means of being airborne to attack with
      talons.</li>

      <li>Two wings and its flight speed as that granted by Avian
      Transformation.</li>

      <li>Two wing attacks (secondary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small) May be given once
      per pair of wings possessed.</li>

      <li><strong>Hover:</strong> The target can halt its movement while flying,
      allowing it to hover without needing to attempt a Fly check. If the target
      is Large or larger and hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with
      lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical
      cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds generated can snuff torches,
      small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of
      non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet.
      Creatures have concealment at 15 feet to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25
      feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50% miss chance, and
      opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature). (Requires wings and a
      fly speed)</li>

      <li><strong>Improved Maneuverability:</strong> The target&#8217;s flight
      maneuverability improves by one step, +1 per 10 caster levels. (Requires a
      fly speed)</li>

      <li><strong>Wingover:</strong> Once each round, the target can turn up to
      180 degrees as a free action without attempting a Fly check. This free
      turn does not consume any additional movement. (Requires a fly speed)</li>

      </ul>
