      <p>As an expunge, you may force the target to attempt a Will save. If they
      fail this save, their magical potency is limited to a degree. You may
      bestow one of the following general drawbacks on your target: Draining
      Casting, Magical Signs, Painful Casting, Rigorous Concentration, Unstable
      Storage, Verbal Casting, or Vulnerable Spellcaster. The target gains the
      selected drawback for the next 24 hours, but does not gain extra spell
      points from them. At 5th caster level, you may also grant them the
      following drawbacks: Center of Power, Emotional Casting, or Variant Wild
      Magic.</p>

      <p>At caster level 6th, and every five caster levels thereafter, you may
      apply an additional drawback to the target. A creature can only suffer
      from one instance of this ability at a time and any creature suffering
      from this talent is aware of the drawbacks they are affected by. At the
      GM&#8217;s discretion, other drawbacks not listed may be granted with this
      talent.</p>
