      <p>You may lift multiple targets at once (up to 1 + 1 per caster level)
      whose combined size does not exceed your maximum telekinesis size. You may
      treat these objects as one effective object for the purpose of Bludgeoning
      a creature, or you may make multiple Bludgeons per round (although you
      cannot make more attacks in a round than would otherwise be allowed with
      your base attack bonus and any respective feats or combat talents if you
      possess the Dancing Weapon talent, applying penalties for full attacks as
      normal). If you spend a spell point to use Hostile Lift or Sustained
      Force, it may apply it to as many of these objects as applicable as if
      each were a different effect. You may also spend a spell point when using
      the Steal, Telekinetic Maneuver, or Telekinetic Push talents to affect
      multiple targets at once (up to one additional target per 2 caster levels,
      minimum 1), although you cannot affect an individual target more than once
      per round with any push or combat maneuver.</p>
