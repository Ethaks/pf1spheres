    value: >
      <p>As an immediate action, you briefly shield the target from harm using
      their own blood. The target suffers blood loss and gains a number of
      temporary hit points equal to the blood loss plus your casting ability
      modifier which lasts until the start of the target&#8217;s next turn. An
      unwilling creature may attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate this
      effect. You may spend a spell point to increase the temporary hit points
      granted by an amount equal to your caster level and DR/&#8211; equal to
      the blood loss until the start of the target&#8217;s next turn.</p>
