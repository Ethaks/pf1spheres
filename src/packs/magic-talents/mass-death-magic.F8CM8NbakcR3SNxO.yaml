      <p>When using your reanimate ability, you may spend an additional spell
      point to reanimate multiple creatures at once. Your Hit Dice limits apply
      to the total number you may reanimate at once with this ability.</p>

      <p>When making a ghost strike, you may spend an additional spell point to
      form your ghost strike into a close-range cone, allowing you to make an
      attack roll against every target within this area. (Formerly Greater Ghost
      Strike and Mass Reanimate)</p>
