      <p>You may allow the target to benefit from their sacrifices. Each round
      as a free action the target may decide to gain a +2 insight bonus to two
      of Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saving throws and a -2 penalty to the
      other, or to gain neither bonus nor penalty. This choice remains until
      they decide to change it. This bonus (but not the penalty) increases by 1
      for every 10 caster levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect to take damage equal to their Hit
      Dice (to a maximum of your caster level) and gain half this amount
      (minimum 1) as an insight bonus to a single saving throw, attack roll,
      combat maneuver check, skill check, or ability check.</p>
