      <p>As a manabond, you may create a magical conduit between yourself and
      the recipient. As long as the manabond holds, you may target the creature
      with any magic sphere effects with a range of touch or greater as if the
      creature was in range and you had line of sight and line of effect to the
      creature. You may not use this ability to channel effects that require an
      attack roll.</p>
