    value: >
      <p>Your companion has an animal intellect, with its starting Intelligence
      reduced to 2. A bestial companion may not have its Intelligence raised by
      any (form) talent (though may still receive other benefits from such
      talents). Bestial companions count as possessing the animal creature type
      in addition to the outsider creature type for all skills and effects and
      require the use of the Handle Animal skill to direct. Without direction,
      they are friendly to the creature that summoned them but otherwise act
      according to their nature. A bestial companion gains an additional free
      (form) talent. A companion that has this companion archetype may not also
      possess the mindless or puppet companion archetypes. A bestial companion
      begins play trained for one purpose (see the Handle Animal skill) plus
      gains 1 bonus trick, +1 at 3 Hit Dice and every 3 Hit Dice thereafter. If
      using Spheres of Might, your bestial companion counts as an animal ally,
      though is not a valid target for the tame ability (per the rules in the
      Beastmastery sphere).</p>
