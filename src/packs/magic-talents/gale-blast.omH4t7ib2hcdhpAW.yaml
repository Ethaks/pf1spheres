      <p>You may change your destructive blast into a forceful wind that deals
      nonlethal bludgeoning damage. You may make a trip combat maneuver as a
      free action at range against any creature struck by the attack or that
      failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required. Your CMB for this
      check is equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier. If
      this check fails, you are not tripped in return.</p>
