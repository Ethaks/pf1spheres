      <p>You may create solid objects made of force energy. Any solid object
      (such as something that could be created from wood) can be created out of
      force, but objects made from force have no weight (see the Lighten talent
      from the Enhancement sphere), however, if you choose you may
      &#8216;anchor&#8217; an object of force, cause it to become immovable from
      the place it was created, even floating in the air. If broken through
      damage or a successful Strength check, objects of force immediately
      disappear. Objects of force stop the movement of incorporeal creatures and
      can be used to harm them and other creatures vulnerable to force effects.
      Objects of force possess 10 hit points per inch and a hardness equal to
      your caster level. An object of force can be any one color and is
      translucent but easily noticeable, and require no Perception check to see
      while imparting a -2 penalty to Perception checks to see through them. If
      you possess Transparency you may make the object invisible (requiring a
      Perception check to detect with a DC equal to 10 + their size modifier +
      your caster level) or entirely opaque without spending an additional spell
      point, chosen at the time of its creation.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Creation sphere effects made with this
      talent have the force descriptor.</p>
