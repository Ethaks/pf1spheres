      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere (Reversion (advanced)),
      caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When using the Reversion talent, you may allow the target to retrain
      any and all class levels they possess, choosing a new class, feats,
      spells, skills, or other class options as appropriate. The target of this
      ability cannot immediately use limited-use powers gained in this fashion
      that it did not previously have, and must rest to regain any bardic
      performance rounds, rage rounds, spell points, spell slots, or other
      limited use abilities granted by these new class levels.</p>

      <h5 id="toc42"><span>Reversion and Complete Reversion</span></h5>

      <p>The Reversion and Complete Reversion talents presented here offer some
      very flexible options for players in that they both allow for rapid
      retraining in the event that a player grows dissatisfied with their
      character, and in that it allows a character to swap to a different build
      during a short rest (albeit at some expense of character daily resources).
      While these abilities can be both interesting and useful, they also have
      the potential to severely impact play at the table if they are not managed
      wisely. We strongly encourage any character planning on using Reversion or
      Complete Reversion during play (such as to change from a Symbiat
      (Chronomancer) to a Fighter (Fracture) when confronted with an opponent
      who is immune to magic) to have their alternate build put together before
      they sit down at the table so that they are not trying to rebuild a
      character while the rest of the party is trying to move forward with the
      story.</p>

      <p>We also encourage players planning to use this ability on themselves to
      choose alternate builds that still have access to a spell point pool and
      the Reversion or Complete Reversion talents in the event they find they
      enjoyed their previous build more; once a character has trained away their
      ability to use these talents, they may find that they cannot easily access
      them again.</p>
