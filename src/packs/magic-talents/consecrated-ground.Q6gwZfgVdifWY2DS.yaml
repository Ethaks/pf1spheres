      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere (Bound Consecration),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>When you use a consecration that remains in place using Bound
      Consecration, you may spend three spell points to allow the effect to
      continue for 2 hours per caster level without concentration. You may take
      this talent a second time at 10th caster level, which allows you to spend
      three spell points to make the effect permanent.</p>
