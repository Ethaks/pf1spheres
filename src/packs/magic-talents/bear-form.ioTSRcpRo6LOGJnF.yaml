      <p>When you channel a bear spirit, you may spend a spell point to increase
      the power of the bear spirit so that you transform into a bear for the
      duration of the effect. This is a polymorph effect.</p>

      <p>When transformed into a bear, you gain the usual +10 bonus from
      polymorph to Disguise checks to pass as a bear, and you also lose your
      normal power of speech, although you gain the ability to speak and
      understand bears. You gain a bite attack and two claw attacks (1d4
      Medium), and you gain low-light vision, scent, a 40 ft. move speed, and
      the benefits of being a quadruped. You gain a +2 natural armor bonus which
      increases by 1 per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p>At 5th caster level you gain a 30 ft. climb speed and a +2 size bonus
      to Strength.</p>

      <p>At 10th caster level your claw attacks gain the grab universal monster
      ability, and you may choose to become Large size, which gives you +4 size
      bonus to Strength but a -2 penalty to Dexterity.</p>

      <p>At 15th caster level, your bite and claw natural attacks increase their
      damage by one die size.</p>

      <p>At 20th caster level you may choose to become Huge size, which gives
      you a +6 size bonus to Strength, but a -2 penalty to Dexterity.</p>
