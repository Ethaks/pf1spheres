    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to teleport multiple creatures, up to 1
      additional target per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). You may choose whether
      or not to include yourself in the group to be teleported. Each creature
      must be touching you or someone else in the affected group to be
      teleported, unless you possess the Ranged Warp talent. If you possess the
      Unwilling Teleport talent, you only need to spend one spell point no
      matter how many unwilling targets are affected. If one unwilling target
      succeeds at their saving throw, other creatures are still affected as
      normal. All targets must be within the same distance from each other at
      their destination as they were required to be in order to be teleported
      (touching, unless you possess Ranged Warp).</p>
