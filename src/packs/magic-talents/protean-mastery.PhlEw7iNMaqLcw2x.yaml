      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Belated Shift:</strong> You may spend an additional spell point
      to leave one trait option unassigned. You may assign any valid trait to
      this slot at any time as a swift action, or spend a spell point to do so
      as an immediate action, paying any spell points required for the chosen
      trait at that time. Once assigned, the trait persists for 1 minute and
      cannot be changed again until 1 minute after expiring. The target must be
      within close range or the range of your shapeshift for you to assign a
      trait in this fashion.</p>

      <p><strong>Close Wounds:</strong> The target gains the ability to end any
      ongoing bleed effects it suffers from as a swift action.</p>

      <p><strong>Lycanthropic Hide:</strong> The target gains DR 3/silver. This
      improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Shift Organs:</strong> The target gains a 25% ability to ignore
      critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 10 caster
      levels, to a maximum of 100%.</p>
