      "value": "<p>Talents marked with the (cloud) tag allow the caster to spend a standard action to create clouds of mental energy that emanate from an area, object, or creature within close range. When applying a cloud to an unwilling creature or an attended object they are allowed a Will save to resist, and both placing a cloud and the effects of a cloud are subject to spell resistance. A creature is immune to cloud effects placed upon itself or its worn and carried equipment.</p>\n<p>An imbued area may either be 10 feet in radius + an extra 5 feet per caster level, or a 10-foot wide area that extends for a length of 10 feet + 10 feet per caster level (such as would be appropriate to fill a 10-foot wide hallway). An imbued item may be no larger than 5 cubic feet per caster level in size. A creature may be up to the caster&#8217;s size + 1 size category for every 5 caster levels. It is possible to imbue a portion of an item or creature (a single head of a massive, two-headed dragon or a single segment of a lengthy carpet with blood smeared over it, for instance) but hiding a portion of an item or creature will not prevent the whole of it from being noticed. Unless otherwise specified, a cloud&#8217;s radius extends from an item or creature as if the creature was the center of an imbued area measured as a radius.</p>\n<p>As with charms, most clouds have three strengths; lesser, greater, and powerful. Spell point expenditures remain the same for the three strengths, and you may only affect a creature with a cloud if you could also affect it with a charm. Similarly, the Powerful Charm talent is required to use the powerful versions of clouds and you may only imbue the same item, creature, or area with a lesser cloud once per day. With the exception of Mass Charm, (cloud) talents are affected by talents that affect charms.</p>\n",
