    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to grant a target immunity to all negative
      effects from your (darkness) or (blot) talents for 1 hour per caster
      level. This does not grant the target the ability to see in your darkness
      if it does not already possess the means to do so, but it does allow
      creatures with darkvision to see in Pure Darkness.</p>

      <p>You may gain this talent a total of twice. If gained a second time, you
      may choose to have your clearsight apply to (darkness) and (blot) talents
      cast by allies. If you or your ally gains the benefit of Clearsight from
      another source, you may choose to allow it to it apply to your own
      darkness and blot effects as well. Status as an ally is determined at the
      time Clearsight is cast and does not change for its duration.</p>
