      <p>When you are using control weather to create Wind of severity level 4
      or above in an area of Aridity severity level 4 or above, you may cause
      lightning to strike as if there were storm effects of a severity level
      equal to the Wind severity level. The ability to control where lightning
      strikes and the increased frequency from Storm Lord applies to these
      lightning strikes.</p>
