      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to place this word on
      a target suffering from a mind-affecting, curse, or possession effect and
      attempt a magic skill check.</p>

      <p>If you succeed, the effect ends and you may spend a spell point to
      learn the name and creature type and subtypes of the effect&#8217;s
      originator, along with why it placed the target under the effect. The
      description of the reason for placing the target under the effect is
      specific but no more than one short sentence. (For example, &#8220;He
      killed my father,&#8221; is generally appropriate, but &#8220;I hate
      him,&#8221; is not because it is not specific enough.) If the target is
      affected by more than one such effect, you may either choose a specific
      one you are aware of to remove or select one at random. You may not
      attempt to remove a given effect with this talent more than once per
      day.</p>
