      "value": "<p>You can cause the bodies you control to respond in gruesome and disgusting manners.</p>\n<p>As a (still), you can cause a creature under your blood control to develop cysts and engorged pustules across their body. When another creature confirms a critical threat against your target, one of these cysts bursts. When a cyst bursts, the target immediately suffers damage equal to your blood loss, and any adjacent enemies are exposed to a single disease the target is suffering from (of your choice), and must immediately succeed at a save against that disease or become afflicted by it.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If using the optional ruleset for Called Shots, any creature can attempt to burst a cyst by making an easy called shot.</p>\n<p>As a (blood art), you can cause a single creature within range to suffer blood loss and suddenly manifest a large cyst, which immediately bursts. Creatures adjacent to your target must attempt a saving throw against any diseases your target was suffering from. If your target was suffering from a disease, they must succeed at a Fortitude save or else be overwhelmed and disoriented by pain. On a failed saving throw, the target is sickened for 1 round and suffers 1d10 damage, plus an additional 1d10 damage per 5 caster levels you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> When you expel a disease with the Manipulate Health talent, you can deal blood loss to the creature to cause any creature within 5 feet of them to attempt a save against the disease.</p>\n",
