      <p>Creatures within this ward or bearing this aegis are treated as having
      no alignment for all magical effects. Effects that detect alignment (such
      as the Divine Alignment alternate divination from the Divination sphere)
      do not detect the creature or creatures protected, while those that affect
      certain alignments have no effect on protected creatures at all. This does
      not allow a creature to disguise their alignment - they appear as an
      absence of alignment.</p>
