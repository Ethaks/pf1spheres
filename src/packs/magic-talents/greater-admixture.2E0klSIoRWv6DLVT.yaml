      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (Admixture), caster
      level 5th.</p>

      <p>When using the Admixture talent, you may spend an additional spell
      point to add a third (blast type) talent. The damage dealt is split
      between the three blast types and the additional effects from each blast
      type apply normally. If different damage die apply to the different types,
      use the largest. If the blast types have different caster levels, then use
      the lowest caster level for determining the Admixtured destructive
      blast&#8217;s caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> You do not increase the casting time or spend
      an additional spell point when using the admixture talent with blast types
      from the same blast type group. The additional spell point cost of Greater
      Admixture still applies. This can be used to apply two Admixture feats to
      a single destructive blast.</p>
