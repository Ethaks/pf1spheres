    value: >
      <p>When you lift an object with your telekinesis and move it into your
      square or drop an item you are holding, you may place it in a passive
      orbit around you. An object in orbit drifts slowly around you, moving with
      you when you move as if you carried it, and does not require concentration
      to remain in orbit, though it does nothing except drift passively. At any
      point you may begin concentrating on it again, directing it and using it
      normally with your telekinesis, or you may pick up an item in orbit as a
      free action. You may have multiple objects around you at one time so long
      as their total size does not exceed the size limit of your telekinesis. If
      you possess the Dancing Weapon talent, you are considered to be wielding
      any object in your orbit and may use them to make attacks, though they are
      still made through the Dancing Weapon talent. Items caught with Catch may
      immediately be placed into orbit. You may not use Hostile Lift in
      conjunction with Orbit.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Dancing Weapon specifies only 'wielding' in the
      context of a weapon; you can bash someone over the head with that
      implement, but no it does not mean you get its implement bonuses while in
      your orbit.</p>
