      <p>Your mastery of plantlife becomes even more pronounced. Increase the
      maximum radius of your Entangle by an additional 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>When using Pummel, you may spend an additional spell point. If you do,
      you may affect an additional number of branches equal to 1 + 1 per 5
      caster levels.</p>

      <p>When using Harvest, you may produce 2 magical berries per caster level,
      along with the usual food. Any creature who consumes one of these berries
      is healed 1 hit point. These berries lose their magical potency after 24
      hours.</p>
