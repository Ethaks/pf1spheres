      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Putrid Vomit:</strong> You can spew vomit up to 30 feet as a
      standard action. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with no range
      increment. A creature struck by this attack must succeed on a Fortitude
      save or be for sickened for 1d4 rounds. If you spend a spell point as part
      of making the attack, the creature is instead nauseated for 1d4 rounds on
      a failed save and sickened for 1 round on a successful save.</p>

      <p><strong>Spoilage:</strong> This fey-blessing has no duration and is
      considered an instantaneous effect. You may cause an amount of food
      sufficient to feed 1 Medium creature per caster level to spoil. This does
      not remove other changes made to the food, such as adding poison or
      magical effects unless you spend a spell point and succeed on a magic
      skill check against the poison or effect&#8217;s DC.</p>

      <p><strong>Unspoil:</strong> This fey-blessing has no duration and is
      considered an instantaneous effect. You may cause an amount of spoiled
      food sufficient to feed 1 Medium creature per caster level to return to a
      palatable state. This does not remove other changes made to the food, such
      as adding poison or magical effects unless you spend a spell point and
      succeed on a magic skill check against the poison or effect&#8217;s DC.
      Restoring the food does not prevent future spoilage.</p>
