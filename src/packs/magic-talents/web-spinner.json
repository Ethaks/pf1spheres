      "value": "<p>Your companion gains the ability to use webs to support itself and up to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, it can throw a web up to once per minute as a standard action. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the companion. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the companion&#8217;s Hit Dice + the companion&#8217;s Constitution modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it take a &#8211;4 penalty.</p>\n<p>The companion can create sheets of sticky webbing in adjacent squares up to three times its size (so a Medium companion can create a sheet that is 15-foot-by-15-foot.). Doing so requires a full-round action and counts as having used its web.</p>\n<p>Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section of web has a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the companion that created it and DR 5/&#8212;.</p>\n<p>If the companion possesses a climb speed, it can move across its own web at its climb speed. While touching a web it created, the companion can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.</p>\n<p>If your companion is dismissed, any webs it created immediately disappear.</p>\n",
