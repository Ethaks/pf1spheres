      <p>As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in
      conjunction with making a ghost strike. This casting cannot be reduced
      below a standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity,
      unless as usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the
      attack, it is also struck by the ghost strike. If using a scatter weapon,
      the strike only applies to a single target, chosen at the time of
      attack.</p>
