    value: >
      <p>You may create an aegis that protects against tugs on the strands of
      fate. This grants a +4 morale bonus to saving throws against effects from
      the divination magic school, effects from the Divination and Fate spheres,
      and effects with the curse descriptor. This also applies to all spells,
      spell-like, and supernatural abilities originating from hags and
      outsiders. The subject is granted a Will save to negate curse effects even
      if one is not normally allowed.</p>
