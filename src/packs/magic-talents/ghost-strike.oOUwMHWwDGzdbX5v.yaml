      <p>As a standard action, you may make a ghost strike, summoning negative
      energy as a melee touch attack or a ranged touch attack within medium
      range. A ghost strike is considered a negative energy death effect, and as
      such has no effect on undead, constructs, and other creatures immune to
      such things (although some talents provide exceptions). Ghost strike
      effects do not stack with themselves, and are subject to spell
      resistance.</p>

      <p>You gain the following ghost strike when you gain the Death sphere:</p>
