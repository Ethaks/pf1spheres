      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Distant Teleport, Unseeing Teleport), caster level 10th.</p>\n<p>When teleporting, you may spend 2 spell points to increase the range to 100 miles per caster level. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p>\n<p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d100 and consult the following table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.</p>\n<strong>Table: Mishap</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Familiarity</th>\n<th>On Target</th>\n<th>Off Target</th>\n<th>Similar Area</th>\n<th>Mishap</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very familiar</td>\n<td>01&#8211;97</td>\n<td>98&#8211;99</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Studied carefully</td>\n<td>01&#8211;94</td>\n<td>95&#8211;97</td>\n<td>98&#8211;99</td>\n<td>100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seen casually</td>\n<td>01&#8211;88</td>\n<td>89&#8211;94</td>\n<td>95&#8211;98</td>\n<td>99&#8211;100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Viewed once</td>\n<td>01&#8211;76</td>\n<td>77&#8211;88</td>\n<td>89&#8211;96</td>\n<td>97&#8211;100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>False destination</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n<td>&#8212;</td>\n<td>81&#8211;92</td>\n<td>93&#8211;100</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Familiarity:</strong> &#8220;Very familiar&#8221; is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. &#8220;Studied carefully&#8221; is a place you know well, either because you can currently physically see it or you have been there often. &#8220;Seen casually&#8221; is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. &#8220;Viewed once&#8221; is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as the Scrying advanced talent. &#8220;False destination&#8221; is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d100, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p>\n<p><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d100 of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.</p>\n<p><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that is visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell&#8217;s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten &#8220;scrambled.&#8221; You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time &#8220;Mishap&#8221; comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.</p>\n",
