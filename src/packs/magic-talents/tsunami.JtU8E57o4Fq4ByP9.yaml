      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((water) package,
      Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>As a concentration effect, you spend 2 spell points to create a wave of
      water 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide per caster level, and 2 feet tall per
      caster level. This wave moves in a straight line at 60 feet per round over
      water (30 feet per round over land), and if not combined with Create
      Water, must originate from a large body of water. It travels perpendicular
      to its width, and may be maintained for no more than 5 rounds.</p>

      <p>Creatures struck by the tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage
      (a Fortitude save halves this damage) and are subject to a special CMB
      check. The wave&#8217;s CMB is equal to your caster level + your casting
      ability modifier + 8 (for the wave&#8217;s size). If this CMB check
      defeats a creature&#8217;s CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried
      along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to
      escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim
      check opposed by the wave&#8217;s CMB check. If a creature fails to
      escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save
      for half) and continues being carried along by the wave.</p>

      <p>Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller
      and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the
      wave&#8217;s journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures
      or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning
      damage when a tsunami passes through its space&#8212;if this is enough to
      destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the
      wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage
      dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement or the Freedom word
      prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not
      prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.</p>

      <p>A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed
      by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving
      a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.</p>
