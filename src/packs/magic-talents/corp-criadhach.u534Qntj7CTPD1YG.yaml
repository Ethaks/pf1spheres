      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Duplicate (advanced),
      Fleshcraft (advanced, material)), caster level 10th.<br>

      When you use Duplicate to create a replica of a creature (which may only
      be an unliving body resembling the creature if you do not possess the
      Bestow Life advanced talent), you may spend a spell point to create a
      sympathetic link with the creature that the duplicate is modelled after.
      This link may take one of the two following forms.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Redoubled Pain:</strong> Whenever the duplicate takes damage
      from any source, the original person takes an equal amount of damage
      unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. In addition, when you use a magic
      sphere ability, you may target the duplicate to affect the creature it was
      made from, allowing you to affect them regardless of distance or line of
      sight. The sympathetic link makes the creature immediately aware of the
      incoming effect and allows them to defend against it without being
      surprised, even if asleep, though they are not made aware of the
      magic&#8217;s precise nature or source. The creature is allowed a
      Fortitude save to negate the effect regardless of whether the effect would
      normally allow a save. After conveying magic 1 + 1 time per 10 caster
      levels, the duplicate crumbles and becomes useless. The first time that
      such a Fortitude save against this ability succeeds (regardless of if
      damage or a magic effect is applied), the original creature is immune to
      this effect for 24 hours. This link does not function across planes.
      Whenever a creature is affected by this ability, they know the general
      direction towards their duplicate.</li>

      <li><strong>There Can Be Only One:</strong> If the duplicate and the
      original creature come into physical contact with each other (which can
      occur when a successful touch attack is made by the duplicate or using the
      duplicate), the duplicate is instantly destroyed and the original creature
      takes 1d8 points of untyped damage per caster level (Fortitude save for
      half).</li>

      </ul>
