      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Greater Divine
      [range], Scrying (advanced), Viewing (divine)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When using the Scrying advanced talent, you may spend an additional
      spell point to decrease the action needed to concentrate on the effect by
      1 step (normally a full-round action to a standard). In addition, you may
      move your sensor without following a target with a speed of 150 feet once
      each round as a free action.</p>
