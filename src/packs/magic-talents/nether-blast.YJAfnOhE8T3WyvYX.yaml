    value: >
      <p>You may change the damage type of your destructive blast to negative
      energy. Any creature struck by the attack or that failed their Reflex
      saving throw if one was required must succeed at a Will saving throw or be
      shaken for 1 round. A nether blast does not damage undead; instead, the
      undead must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 1 round. This
      bypasses the immunities of the undead type.</p>
