      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere (Blur (glamer),
      Manipulate Aura (sensory, magic)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point when using Blur to have it also
      cause spell failure chance equal to its miss chance. This spell failure
      applies to all spells, sphere effects, spell-like and supernatural
      abilities that go to, from, or whose line of sight or effect cross the
      illusion.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This talent's spell failure chance only
      applies to an effect if the granted miss chance would apply under similar
      circumstances. For both a trick and distorting figment, this spell failure
      chance applies to effects normally. For a distorting glamer, this spell
      failure chance only applies against effects made against the target (e.g.
      single target effects).</p>
