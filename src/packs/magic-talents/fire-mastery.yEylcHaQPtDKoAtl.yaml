      <p>You gain a number of ways of expressing mastery over fire. You gain the
      following geomancing abilities:</p>

      <p><strong>Alter Light:</strong> Concentration. You may alter the light
      produced by a fire within your Affect Fire maximum. You may halve or
      double the radius of its light, as well as change its granted light from
      an emanation to a cone of double its light radius. You may also increase
      its granted light by 1 level (usually to bright light) or decrease its
      granted light by 1 level (to dim light).</p>

      <p><strong>Extinguish:</strong> Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point
      to extinguish any and all fires within your geomancing range that are
      within your Affect Fire maximum, as you desire.</p>

      <p><strong>Reflash:</strong> Instantaneous. If a non-magical fire within
      range would become extinguished (through magical or mundane means), you
      may, as an immediate action, cause the fire to relight in up to a 15-foot
      radius burst of flame dealing fire damage equal to the largest sized fire
      you can create. This can be used to reignite a character who has caught on
      fire and extinguished the flames. If so, a successful Reflex save halves
      the damage and negates catching fire.</p>
