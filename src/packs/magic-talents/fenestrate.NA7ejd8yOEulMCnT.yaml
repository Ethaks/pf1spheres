    value: >
      <p>You can create bright light that makes everything and everyone within
      the area of the bright light translucent enough that they can be seen
      through. This includes creatures, objects, structures, and even the ground
      itself. Objects are not invisible, however, and seeing through them is
      difficult. Objects that grant cover still grant concealment, but any
      creature using such an object to hide receives a -10 penalty to their
      Stealth. Magical fog effects are countered by this Light talent the way
      magical darkness can be countered by Light talents. Effects based on light
      (such as most Light sphere abilities) can pass through to affect other
      objects, but other effects are still stopped by solid objects.</p>

      <p>This light can be placed on a single structure to make it translucent.
      If the structure is larger than the area of the glow, then only part of
      the structure is made translucent.</p>
