      <p>You may spend a spell point to decelerate time within a 10-foot radius
      burst, +5 feet per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p>All effects that are active within this area or on a creature within
      this area have their duration extended by 1 round per caster level, to a
      maximum extended duration of twice the effect&#8217;s normal duration (so
      an effect that normally only lasts for 1 round could not be extended in
      this manner for more than 1 additional round). This affects magic (spells,
      sphere abilities, etc.), poisons, diseases, etc., but does not prevent
      creatures within the area from taking actions as normal. In the case of
      effects that target areas, only the portion of the effect contained within
      Stretch Time&#8217;s area is decelerated. Unwilling targets (including
      allies if they so choose) are allowed a Will save to negate this effect
      for themselves or area effects originating from them.</p>

      <p>You can choose whether or not to affect yourself with your own stretch
      time. Stretch Time counters the effects of Fast Time within its affected
      area and vice versa.</p>
