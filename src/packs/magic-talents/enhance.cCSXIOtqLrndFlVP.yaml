      <p>As a standard action, you may enhance a creature or object within close
      range for as long as you concentrate. You may always spend a spell point
      to allow an enhancement to continue for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration. If targeting a creature or intelligent item that does not
      want to be enhanced (or an item in a creature&#8217;s possession that does
      not want their item enhanced), the target is allowed a Will save (DC 10 +
      1/2 caster level + casting ability modifier) to negate the effect.
      Enhancements are subject to spell resistance.</p>

      <p>Each time you use enhance, you choose one enhancement to bestow. When
      you gain the Enhancement sphere, you gain the following enhancement:</p>
