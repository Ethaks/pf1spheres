    value: >
      <p>You can create a telekinetic connection between two objects of any
      size, tethering them together. As a standard action you can tether two
      targets within 30 feet of each other, preventing them from moving further
      than 30 feet from each other without either breaking the tether or
      dragging the other target with them. An unwilling creature gets a Reflex
      save to avoid being tethered. A creature dragging an object follows the
      normal carrying capacity and encumbrance rules, but must use the drag
      combat maneuver to drag an unwilling creature. The tether may be broken as
      a move action with a Strength check equal to the tether&#8217;s save DC. A
      tether lasts as long as you concentrate and an additional number of rounds
      after that equal to your caster level. You may spend a spell point to
      maintain a tether with Sustained Force.</p>
