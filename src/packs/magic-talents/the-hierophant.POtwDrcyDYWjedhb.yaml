    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that allows the target to subsume themselves in
      the group. The target gains an aura with a radius of 30 feet that gives
      allies other than the target a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against
      mind-affecting effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect when an ally within close range
      takes damage to shift up to half the damage the ally takes to themselves.
      The target may discharge this effect even if the damage their ally would
      take would normally reduce them below 1 hit point, and even if it would
      kill them outright. Damage is transferred after the effects of damage
      reduction, energy resistance, immunity and similar effects. The damage
      transferred is empathic in nature and cannot be further reduced, divided,
      or transferred.</p>
