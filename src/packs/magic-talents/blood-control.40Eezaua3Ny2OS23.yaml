      <p>As a standard action, you may establish a link to the blood of a target
      within close range. Unwilling targets are permitted a Fortitude save, and
      the effect is subject to spell resistance. Targets with less than half
      their maximum hit points take a -4 penalty on this save. This link lasts
      for as long as you concentrate, though you may spend a spell point for it
      to last 1 round per caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>Targets that gain immunity to bleed damage from their creature type,
      subtype, or a template are immune to blood control. Creatures that gain
      immunity to bleed damage from other sources are susceptible to blood
      control, but still benefit from their immunity against bleed damage.</p>

      <p>If a second creature attempts to establish blood control on a creature
      that is already controlled, it must succeed at a magic skill check. A
      creature may always attempt to end the blood control on itself by
      attempting a new Fortitude save as a mental-only standard action that may
      be taken even when normally unable to take standard actions, such as when
      dazed or nauseated.</p>

      <p>You may apply one (quicken) or (still) ability as part of casting blood
      control. Once blood control has been established, you may spend a standard
      action (unless otherwise noted) to apply additional (quicken) or (still)
      abilities. Spending at least a standard action to do so counts as
      concentrating on the ongoing blood control for that instance of blood
      control (if able to concentrate on an effect as a move action, applying
      additional (quicken) or (still) abilities as a move action, such as via
      the Quicken metamagic feat, would also count as concentrating for that
      round).</p>

      <p>A creature may not be affected by both a (quicken) and a (still)
      ability at the same time. If a caster attempts to use a (quicken) talent
      on a creature currently under the effects of a (still) talent or vise
      versa, the previous effect ends. Some creatures that are normally immune
      to bleed damage but that frequently feed on blood may be susceptible the
      blood control. Any creature that has used the blood drain universal
      monster ability in the previous hour or any creature composed largely of
      blood (such as a blood golem) may be affected by blood control. Other
      appropriate creatures may also be affected, at the GM&#8217;s
      discretion.</p>
