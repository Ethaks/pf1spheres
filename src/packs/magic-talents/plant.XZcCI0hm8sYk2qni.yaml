      <p><strong>Entangle:</strong> Concentration, requires grass, weeds, vines,
      or underbrush. You cause plants to grow rapidly, wrapping themselves
      around everything in a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area
      centered within range. Creatures within this area must succeed at a Reflex
      save or gain the entangled condition and become unable to move. Creatures
      that succeed at their save can move as normal, but those that remain in
      the area must save again at the end of each turn you maintain the effect.
      Creatures that move into the area must save immediately.</p>

      <p>Those that fail end their movement and gain the entangled condition.
      Entangled creatures can break free as a move action, if they succeed at a
      Strength or Escape Artist check against a DC equal to the effect&#8217;s
      Reflex save DC. This area is also considered difficult terrain for the
      duration of the effect. If the area contained plants with thorns, all
      creatures suffer 1 point of piercing damage each round they are within
      this area.</p>

      <p><strong>Harvest:</strong> Instantaneous, requires fruit trees, berry
      bushes, or food crops. You may spend a spell point to cause plants to
      sprout food spontaneously. You may affect up to 1 plant per caster level
      within range. Each plant produces enough food to provide 3 Medium-sized
      creatures or 1 horse with food for a day.</p>

      <p><strong>Pummel:</strong> Concentration, requires a tree. You cause a
      tree branch to come alive and attack a foe you designate. The tree cannot
      move, but it makes one slam attack each round against the designated
      target until you spend a move action to designate another target or until
      the target dies or moves out of range. Slam attacks from the pummel deal
      damage as if it were a primary attack, may be enhanced as a natural weapon
      as if the tree branch were a creature, and are not subject to spell
      resistance. You cannot designate a target you cannot perceive.</p>

      <p>The branch has a Strength score equal to 10 + your caster level, and a
      to-hit modifier equal to your caster level + its Strength modifier + its
      size modifier. You may animate a Medium branch at 1st caster level, and
      your maximum size increases by 1 category per 5 caster levels. An entire
      tree can count as a branch, provided the tree is not larger than your
      maximum Pummel size.</p>

      <p>In place of animating a branch of Large-size or larger, you may animate
      a pair of branches that are two sizes or smaller on the same tree. You can
      only do this once per branch that you otherwise could animate with pummel.
      For example, at CL 20, when targeting a Colossal tree, they can choose to
      animate: 1 Colossal-sized branch, or 2 Huge-sized branches, or 2
      Large-sized branches, or 2 Medium-sized branches, etc. Branches are still
      objects, and as such always fail saving throws, can gain the broken
      condition (suffering a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls), and are
      destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are very few worlds, even among fantasy,
      where trees exist that are Colossal+ or larger. However, a caster of
      particularly high caster level may still subdivide larger branches into
      smaller branches using Table: Number of Branches Per Size Category of Tree
      as a guide. For example, a Colossal++ tree would have 1d4 (avg 3)
      Colossal-sized branches, 3d4 (avg 8) Huge-sized branches, and 9d4 (avg 23)
      Large-sized branches. Regardless of your caster level, or the size of the
      tree, you cannot animate a branch that is larger than Colossal-sized.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Primary natural attacks usually get a 1.5x
      Strength multiplier for their damage. See the rules on natural attacks in
      the CRB for more information on this.</p>
