      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to speak a terrible
      truth. All targets within 30 ft. must pass a Will save or be confused for
      1d4+1 rounds as their minds reel from the effects of your words. This is a
      language-dependent effect; targets with an Intelligence below 3 or who
      cannot understand your words are immune.</p>
