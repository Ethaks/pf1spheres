    value: >
      <p>Instead of a single destructive blast, you unleash a volley of
      destructive power. You deliver 2 surges, each requiring a melee touch
      attack or a ranged touch attack within range. A ranged surge counts as a
      ray attack. Each surge may be delivered at the same or different targets,
      but all surges must be delivered simultaneously. Determine the damage
      dealt by each surge by distributing the damage dice dealt by your
      destructive blast between each surge. A surge must deal at least 1 damage
      die or you do not create that surge. If you spend an additional spell
      point, you may deliver one additional surge, plus 1 surge for every 6
      caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p>This (blast shape) only damages a target once, even if multiple surges
      hit a single target, and would only count as damaging a target once for
      the Cascade Failure talent.</p>

      <p>Additional effects from a destructive blast modified with this blast
      shape only affect a creature once regardless of how many times they are
      damaged.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A destructive blast which deals 7d6 damage
      could be distributed between the two surges as 3d6 and 4d6, 1d6 and 6d6,
      or any combination the caster chooses. Each surge must deal at least 1d6
      damage, or the caster does not create it and the burst is lost.</p>

      <p>A caster would only make a single disarm attempt against a creature
      struck multiple times by this blast shape when modified by the Static
      Blast blast type, and only applies additional effects from the Admixture
      talent or admixture feats to the damaged creature a single time. Effects
      not caused by the destructive blast, such as additional damage caused by
      the Fate sphere Harm (word), would trigger on each successful surge.
      Additional damage from other sources (such as the bonus damage from the
      Primal Blast feat) would apply to each surge.</p>
