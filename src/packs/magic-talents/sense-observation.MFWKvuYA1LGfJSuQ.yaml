      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Detect Scrying
      (sense)).</p>

      <p>You may spend 1 spell point to detect any awareness of your presence.
      You know when any creatures are aware of your presence or when they are
      looking at you or a representation of you. If you have familiar knowledge
      of a subject, you know when that creature is thinking of you. You know the
      number of creatures that are observing you and what senses each creature
      is using to observe you (including indirect means such as scrying or
      cameras). This does not discern the identity of these beings, just the
      knowledge that you are being observed. This effect applies only to
      creatures which are on the same plane as you. If you sense that a creature
      senses you, you are considered to have secondhand knowledge of that
      creature for the purpose of scrying on it.</p>
