      <p>You may spend a spell point to designate a touched spot, object, or
      creature as a personal dimensional beacon, which lasts for one hour per
      caster level. You may spend a spell point to teleport yourself to your
      teleport beacon regardless of how far away it is, so long as it is on the
      same plane. If your teleport beacon is a creature or object, you may
      instead teleport your teleport beacon to you. You must use the Unwilling
      Teleport talent to do this with an unwilling creature, and they are
      allowed a saving throw as normal.</p>

      <p>There is no limit to the number of teleport beacons you can have active
      at one time. If you possess multiple teleport beacons and the Mass
      Teleport talent, you may use the Mass Teleport talent to teleport multiple
      teleport beacons at once, as if you were touching all affected targets.
      All affected teleport beacons must be teleported to the same location
      (you, or an unaffected teleport beacon of your choice).</p>
