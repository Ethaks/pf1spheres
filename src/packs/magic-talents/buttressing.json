This is a move action, or you may spend a spell point to do this as a swift action. You must have line of sight to the barrier to use this talent.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you spend a spell point to maintain a barrier without concentration, you may spend an additional spell point to make it self-repairing. The barrier regains 1 hit point + 1 hit point per 2 caster levels at the start of each of your turns.</p>\n<p>A barrier that has been reduced to 0 hit points has been destroyed and cannot regain hit points or be restored using this talent.</p>\n<p>If used on a barrier comprised of cubes using the Shaped Ward talent, this talent allows each cube to regain 1 lost hit point or for 1 cube to regain all lost hit points when you spend a move action or a spell point and a swift action to use this ability. When you spend a spell point to maintain the barrier without concentration, you may spend an additional spell point to make each cube regain 1 hit point per round. A cube that has been reduced to 0 hit points has been destroyed and cannot regain hit points or be restored using this talent, though the remaining cubes can still regain hit points.</p>\n",
