      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a blood totem. Whenever an enemy
      within this totem&#8217;s area deals damage to an ally within this
      totem&#8217;s area, the damage roll is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0),
      and the attacker takes 1 damage that bypasses all damage resistance. The
      damage reduced and the damage dealt by this totem increases by 1 for every
      5 caster levels you possess.</p>
