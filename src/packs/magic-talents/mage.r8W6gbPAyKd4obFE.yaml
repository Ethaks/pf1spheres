      <p>Your companion gains poor base attack bonus progression (equal to 1/2
      Hit Dice, rounded down) and uses a d6 for its Hit Dice. The companion must
      choose the Magical Companion (form) talent as its free (form) talent, but
      is not required to use natural casting, and may gain a casting tradition
      of your choice. The companion is considered a Mid-Caster, and gains spell
      points equal to its Hit Dice plus its casting ability modifier.</p>

      <p>A mage companion must still spend feats to gain additional magic
      talents, as usual, and does not gain the two free bonus talents a caster
      usually gains with the casting class feature. A mage companion loses Climb
      and Swim as class skills but gains Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft as
      class skills. A mage companion may choose to give up the natural attacks
      granted by its base form to gain the Implement Bearer (form) talent as a
      bonus talent. This archetype cannot be combined with the mindless
      companion archetype.</p>
