      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to hear your name or another specific
      phrase of your choice whenever it is mentioned. When you activate this
      sense, designate a word, phrase, or name. If a creature within 1 mile per
      caster level of you uses that word, phrase, or name to refer to you or an
      action in relation to you (such as attacking your base or intent to find
      something that belongs to you), you immediately hear the rest of the
      sentence in which they used the word, phrase, or name. You may dismiss
      this sense to learn the speaker&#8217;s name, appearance, and
      location.</p>
