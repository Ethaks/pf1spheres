      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, caster level 5th.</p>\n<p>You may spend 3 spell points and 1 hour to summon the spirit of a dead creature. You must know the exact creature you are trying to summon and be able to designate them (such as their name or place and time of death, etc.) and the more familiar you are with the spirit and the more recently they died, the more likely they are to appear. The spirit you are trying to summon is allowed a Will save with the following modifiers depending on your knowledge and connection to the target, as well as its time of death:</p>\n<strong>Table: Familiarity (Spirit)</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Knowledge</th>\n<th>Will Save Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>None^</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Secondhand (you have heard of the subject)</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Firsthand (you have met the subject)</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Familiar (you know the subject well)</td>\n<td>-5</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>^You must have some sort of connection (see below) to a creature of which you have no knowledge.</p>\n<strong>Table: Connection (Spirit)</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Connection</th>\n<th>Will Save Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Likeness or picture</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Possession or garment</td>\n<td>-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corpse/remains</td>\n<td>-10</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<strong>Table: Time Deceased</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Time the Creature has been Dead</th>\n<th>Will Save Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 year</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 years</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>100 years</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1000 years</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>On a successful saving throw, the target does not appear and may choose to retaliate spiritually, giving you 2 temporary negative levels that last 24 hours (meaning you must save against them becoming permanent). While friends may choose to purposefully fail their saving throw and come willingly, in most other cases being ripped from the afterlife is a horrid experience and can turn even the nicest of spirits hostile. If a spirit succeeds at their saving throw against this effect they cannot be summoned again by the same caster for 1 month. Sometimes, the spirits of heroes, kings, and others are protected by a deity and are simply unable to be summoned.</p>\n<p>Once a spirit has been summoned, you may do any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse&#8217;s knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive. A creature who would have opposed you in life may attempt a new Will save to refuse to answer or to lie with the Bluff skill.</li>\n<li>You may use the spirit as a component when creating an animated object or undead creature (Will negates if unwilling; if the spirit succeeds at its save, it immediately returns to the afterlife as if it had made its original saving throw). You must create the undead creature or animated object as usual, but by placing the spirit into the target, the spirit is brought back to life within this new body. The object or undead creature gains the mental attributes, personality, memories, etc. of the selected spirit, but otherwise is normal for its new creature type. (At the GM&#8217;s discretion, a spirit bound to a permanent animated object or undead creature may recover or gain class levels over time, but loses at least 1 level per CR of its new form.) An undead creature or animated object created in this way is not automatically under your control.</li>\n<li>If you possess the Resurrection advanced Life talent, you may place the spirit into a new body, bringing the soul back to life, even if you do not have the target&#8217;s body, it is missing vital components, or the target has been dead for longer than the time limit. You must possess either a soulless body (such as one created through the Fleshcraft and Create Materials advanced Creation talents), or else a body assembled from other, recently slain bodies. (Assembly requires either the target&#8217;s body with one additional body for every replaced vital component, or else a minimum of six different bodies&#8212;one for each limb, the torso including head, and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required.) You may bring the target back to life with the Resurrection advanced Life talent. The target retains its ability scores and class levels (even those dependent on blood, such as sorcerer levels) but its race and appearance depend on the body possessed.</li>\n</ul>\n",
