      <p>Items you create are more intricate, and much harder to identify as
      fakes. The DC 15 limitation on how high skill checks can reach is removed,
      allowing you to attempt skill checks of any difficulty. When making skill
      checks to create especially expensive and difficult objects you may use
      your casting ability modifier in place of your Intelligence for the Craft
      check, and the DC becomes 10 + 1 per 5 gp in its cost to a maximum of 50
      gp, or DC 20 + 1 per 200 gp in its cost if its cost is above 50 gp.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you may add your caster level to the Appraise DC required
      to detect objects you create as magical fakes. Those attempting to detect
      magic on your created objects must attempt a magic skill check to detect
      any lingering creation auras.</p>
