      <p>You may spend a spell point to gain the tremorsense ability with a
      range of close. You gain sensitivity to vibrations in the ground allowing
      you to automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact
      with the ground; or if underwater, you can instead pinpoint the location
      of creatures moving through the water.</p>
