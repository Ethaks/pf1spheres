      <p>The force that makes up your barriers are as durable as metal, if not
      even more so. Barriers you create reduce all bludgeoning, piercing, and
      slashing damage dealt to it by an amount equal to half your caster level
      (minimum 1). You may spend a spell point to instead allow your barrier to
      reduce all damage types by an amount equal to half your caster level
      (minimum 1).</p>
