      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((fire) package,
      Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to call lava up
      from deep within the earth. This lava bursts from a 10 feet wide hole in
      the ground centered within range and creates a spout 10 feet high per 2
      caster levels. Any creature in this area or who enters this area takes
      10d6 points of fire damage and is hurled into the air and then tossed to
      the ground, suffering falling damage based upon the height of the volcanic
      spray (e.g., if the volcano is 80 feet tall, the creature takes 8d6
      falling damage) and lands prone in a random square adjacent to the spout.
      A successful Reflex saving throw halves the fire damage and the creature
      is not tossed into the air, instead moving to the closest square adjacent
      to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that
      they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the
      creature&#8217;s normal movement.</p>

      <p>In addition, the volcano sprays lava, smoke, and poison gas in a
      hemispherical emanation around itself. The radius of this emanation is
      equal to one half the volcano&#8217;s height (e.g., an 80 foot spout has a
      40-foot radius emanation). All creatures within this area, including
      yourself, have concealment and suffer 2d6 points of fire damage each round
      as lava cascades on them.</p>

      <p>They also suffer 1d6 Constitution damage per round as they inhale
      poisonous gas (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous
      save), as Vog severity level 7 from the Weather sphere. Even after a
      creature leaves the lava-filled area, they suffer 1d6 points of damage for
      1d3 rounds as the lava already on them cools.</p>

      <p>A volcano must be created on the ground and cannot be created in other
      places, such as on the 2nd floor of a building. You can choose to make a
      smaller volcano than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from
      reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of lava
      that&#8217;s smaller than your maximum.</p>
