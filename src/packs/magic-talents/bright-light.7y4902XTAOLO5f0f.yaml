      <p>As a standard action, you may cause one of your glow effects within
      medium range to shed bright light. This may be done as part of the same
      standard action used to cause that object to glow. This produces bright
      light for 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels, and increases the light
      level by one step to a maximum of normal for 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster
      level beyond this. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may
      always spend a spell point as a free action to allow the bright light to
      continue without concentration for 1 minute per caster level or until the
      glow effect expires, whichever comes first. The bright light produced by
      this effect is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of
      creatures that are damaged or destroyed by daylight, but it may affect
      creatures with light blindness or other conditions.</p>

      <h2 id="toc2"><span>Lens</span></h2>

      <p>(Lens) effects allow a user of the Light sphere to bend or alter light
      and its properties. The caster may place a lens as a standard action on
      any target (or sometimes a space) within the same range as their glow.
      This requires a melee or ranged touch attack when used on unwilling
      targets, and is subject to spell resistance. A lens lasts as long as you
      concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow a lens to remain for
      1 hour per caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>When you gain the Light sphere, you gain the following lens:</p>
