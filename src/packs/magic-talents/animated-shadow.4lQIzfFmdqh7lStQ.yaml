      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Shadow Lurk (shadow)),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>By spending one spell point you lend your shadow animation and
      substance, allowing it to move and manipulate objects as if they were an
      additional set of limbs for 1 hour per caster level. Your animated shadow
      has two arms and a reach of 10 feet. It can retrieve and use stored items,
      wield and attack with weapons, activate magical items, accomplish delicate
      tasks like disabling a lock, and deliver touch attacks, all using your own
      statistics and bonuses. These arms can not be used to make additional
      attacks above your normal maximum, gain extra magic item slots, or grant
      additional actions. You may not use other abilities or talents that allow
      you to use your shadow to manipulate objects, such as shadow limb and
      Shadow Boxing, while Animated Shadow is active.</p>
