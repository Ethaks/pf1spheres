      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, when adjacent to a creature that has died very
      recently (within 1 round per caster level) you may spend 3 spell points to
      trap their soul into a gem. The target is allowed a Will save to negate
      the effect, and the gemstone&#8217;s value must be at least 1,000 gp per
      Hit Die of the creature you are attempting to trap. If successful, the
      creature&#8217;s soul becomes trapped within the gemstone. A trapped
      creature cannot be resurrected or have its spirit summoned, unless the
      caster is in possession of this gemstone. The creature trapped inside the
      gemstone always fails its saving throws if the holder of the gemstone uses
      the Summon Spirit advanced Death talent on it.</p>

      <p>If the gemstone is broken, the spirit is released. If the spirit is
      called through the Summon Spirit advanced Death talent, the caster may
      choose to release the spirit, in which case it travels to the afterlife,
      leaving the gem empty and reusable.</p>
