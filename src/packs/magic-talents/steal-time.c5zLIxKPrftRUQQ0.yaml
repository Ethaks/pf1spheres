    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to attempt to erase a creature&#8217;s turn
      from existence. The target is dazed for 1 round (Will negates). If
      successful, you immediately gain an additional standard action. An
      individual target cannot suffer the effects of this ability more than once
      per round. Even if you successfully target multiple creatures in the same
      round with this ability (such as through the Mass Time talent), you cannot
      gain more than a single standard action in a round in this manner, nor can
      you use this new standard action to activate this talent an additional
      time by any means.</p>
