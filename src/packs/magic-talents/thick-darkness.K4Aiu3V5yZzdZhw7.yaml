      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a darkness with substance that
      becomes difficult to move through. Creatures move at half their speed
      through this area, cannot make 5-foot steps, and suffer a -1 penalty to
      all weapon attacks and damage rolls made within or that pass through this
      area -1 per 10 caster levels. Objects that fall within this area are
      slowed so that each 10 feet of darkness reduces the falling damage by 1d6,
      +1d6 per 10 caster levels.</p>
