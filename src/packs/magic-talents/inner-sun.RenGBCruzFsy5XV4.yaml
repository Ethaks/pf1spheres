    value: >
      <p>You grant a creature that you have caused to glow brightly a weapon of
      light they may wield as a weapon. The weapon can be shaped into any melee
      weapon the holder is proficient with as a swift action, and initially
      appears as whatever weapon they choose. On a hit, this does an additional
      1d4 fire damage + 1d4 damage for every 4 caster levels that you
      possess.</p>

      <p>The weapon can not harm invisible or translucent enemies or structures,
      and passes through them harmlessly, possibly damaging things on the other
      side. Targets that are reflective such as a mirror have a 50% miss chance
      against attacks with this weapon. If the creature deliberately lets go of
      the weapon, it disappears, but otherwise the creature can not be
      disarmed.</p>

      <p>You may target a weapon to grant it this additional fire damage, as if
      it were a weapon of light. This extra damage is subject to the same
      restrictions as a weapon of light (does not affect invisibile or
      translucent targets, 50% chance of not affecting reflective
      creatures).</p>
