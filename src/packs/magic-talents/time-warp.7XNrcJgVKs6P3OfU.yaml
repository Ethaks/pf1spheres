      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere, Warp sphere (Distant
      Teleport, True Teleport (advanced), Unseeing Teleport), caster level
      20th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 5 spell points to teleport to a point backwards or
      forwards in time, up to 100 years per caster level, appearing at that
      point in time at a location of your choice within your teleport range, as
      though using True Teleport.</p>

      <p>To see how accurate the teleportation is, consult Table: Mishap found
      on True Teleport. Your familiarity with the destination time is relative,
      and knowledge of the destination time may be determined by succeeding on a
      DC 30 Knowledge (history) check. Succeeding on this check means the caster
      is treated as the destination time as having been &#8220;viewed
      once&#8221;, and for every 5 you exceed the DC, you are treated as having
      an additional step of familiarity with the destination time and
      location.</p>

      <p>A &#8220;false destination&#8221; result when using this talent would
      be teleporting to a nonexistent location at a specific point in time, such
      as a mythical city that does not exist. This talent is otherwise modified
      normally by Warp sphere talents. For example, possessing Mass Teleport
      allows you to teleport to a point in time with other creatures.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Time travel is complex. For example, a caster
      who interacts with the past and returns to their own time may not return
      to their own original timeline, but instead a parallel universe branching
      from actions and changes which occurred when the caster interacts with the
      past. Such changes are ultimately up to GM discretion, and incorporating
      time travel, whether traveling into the past or future, should be done
      with caution.</p>
