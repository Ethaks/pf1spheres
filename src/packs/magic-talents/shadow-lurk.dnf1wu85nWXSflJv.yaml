      <p>As a standard action you may spend a spell point to have a
      target&#8217;s shadow split off from them and form a shadow lurk that acts
      as an independent creature unwaveringly loyal to you for 10 minutes per
      caster level. A shadow lurk appears as a shaded, obviously spurious
      version of the target. It is weightless and its equipment is entirely
      illusionary. It has the same skills, feats, and attributes as the target,
      except that its Strength score is 3, and only has a number of hit points
      equal to your caster level.</p>

      <p>The shadow lurk cannot attack, use extraordinary or supernatural
      abilities, cast spells or use spell-like abilities, or employ its
      target&#8217;s class features, though it can manipulate objects and use
      skills. A shadow lurk must remain within long range of its original source
      or it ceases to exist. The target lacks a shadow while this effect is
      active.</p>

      <p>Retracting a shadow lurk is a move action that does not provoke attacks
      of opportunity. Either the target or the shadow lurk may spend this
      action. If a shadow lurk is killed or exceeds its range, it winks out of
      existence and the target&#8217;s shadow returns to them with a surge of
      energy that causes them to be stunned for 1 round. In either case, the
      target immediately gains the knowledge of everything their shadow lurk
      observed and did while it was detached.</p>

      <p>You may gain this talent a total of twice. If gained a second time, you
      may weave shadowstuff into your shadow lurks, giving them and their
      equipment increased substance. Your shadow lurks use the full Strength
      score of their source, have 2 hit points per caster level, and possess
      non-magical versions of their sources&#8217; equipment. It may flank,
      threaten, and make a single attack per turn using non-magical versions of
      whatever weapons or natural attacks its source possesses. It attacks using
      its source&#8217;s full base attack bonus, Strength score, feats, and
      proficiencies, but deals only half damage. A shadowstuff-imbued shadow
      lurk may not attempt non-attack combat maneuvers, cast spells, or use its
      source&#8217;s class features. Alchemical items created as part of your
      shadow lurks do not function.</p>
