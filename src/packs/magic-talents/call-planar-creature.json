      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere, caster level 1st.</p>\n<p>You may call beings from other planes and bring them into your own. Calling a creature in this manner takes 10 minutes of focused casting and costs 2 spell points. Calling takes one of two forms: allies and hostiles. If you call a servant of an extraplanar being with which you have a strong connection (i.e., a cleric calling a servant of its god) they are considered an ally. All other creatures are considered hostiles, regardless of their disposition towards the caster. GMs have the final say in whether or not a character is capable of calling allies.</p>\n<p>To call a target, you must choose a location within close range for them to appear, and the kind of creature to be called must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual&#8217;s proper name. You may call multiple creatures with one use of this ability (up to 3 at once) but the Hit Dice of a single creature cannot exceed your MSB, while the combined Hit Dice of all creatures cannot exceed your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Allies:</strong> Allies are never hostile and do not resist, although additional payment is always expected for their services. Payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to a quest on your part that matches the creature&#8217;s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p>\n<p>A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per Hit Die of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per Hit Die. A long-term task, one requiring up to 1 day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per Hit Die. A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift.</p>\n<p>Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (unlike a companion from the Conjuration sphere that simply returns to its home plane when reduced to 0 hit points, a called creature actually dies when it is killed). However, at the GM&#8217;s discretion, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature&#8217;s ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.</p>\n<p>If an agreement cannot be reached, the ally returns to their home plane immediately. If you are not willing to give the requested payment, but attempt to press the target into service anyway, treat the creature as hostile. Pressing a creature in this way may have a detrimental effect on any future attempts to call an allied outsider.</p>\n<p><strong>Hostiles:</strong> If a hostile creature is unwilling to be called, it is allowed a Will saving throw to resist. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is not called. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately called (spell resistance does not keep it from being called).</p>\n<p>When a hostile creature is called, it is rooted to a specific location within range (you can decide how much space to give it, up to a 30-foot radius). It cannot leave this area until an agreement with you has been reached. It can escape this location by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your magic skill check, by teleportation or dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check pitted against a DC of your MSD + your Charisma modifier. It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can do as it pleases, including fleeing, returning to its home plane, or attacking you.</p>\n<p>If the creature does not break free of its prison, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature&#8217;s Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones re-offered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to dismiss it (a free action so long as it remains trapped). Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell&#8217;s effect and can escape or attack you.</p>\n<p>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the effect remains for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped).</p>\n<p>Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions. At the end of its task, or when the bargained duration expires, a called ally returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).</p>\n",
