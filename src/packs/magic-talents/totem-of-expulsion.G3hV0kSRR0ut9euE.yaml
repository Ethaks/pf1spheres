    value: >
      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a totem of expulsion. The totem
      creates a field of energy that applies interdimensional pressure to
      creatures that do not belong on your plane, and weakens them. All
      non-native outsiders (including allies) within are sickened (no save)
      while they remain inside the area of the totem. In addition, they receive
      a penalty to any damage reduction, energy resistance, and spell resistance
      they possess equal to your caster level. Energy immunity is also affected:
      treat immune creatures as having a resistance equal to twice their total
      Hit Dice, then subtract your caster level as you would with normal
      resistance, to a minimum of 0. You can only create this totem on your home
      plane.</p>
