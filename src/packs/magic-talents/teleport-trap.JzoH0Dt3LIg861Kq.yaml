      <p>You may lay a teleport effect onto an adjacent, unoccupied 5-foot
      square. If you possess the Ranged Warp talent, you may place this effect
      anywhere within that range. This is a latent teleport effect, except it
      only activates when a creature steps onto the target square, and must
      target the triggering creature.</p>

      <p>You must possess the Unwilling Teleport talent and spend a spell point
      as usual if you want your teleport trap to affect unwilling targets. You
      must possess the Teleport Object talent to affect unattended objects, and
      may decide when making the teleport trap whether unattended objects will
      trigger the effect or not. If you possess the Mass Teleport talent, you
      may spend a spell point to allow the teleport trap to remain after its
      initial use, affecting additional creatures who enter its square until the
      duration expires or it has attempted to teleport 1 creature + 1 per 2
      caster levels (minimum 2 total). You must designate the destination where
      triggering creatures will be teleported when creating a teleport trap.</p>

      <p>When a creature steps into the triggering square, the teleport effect
      activates, transporting the triggering creature to the designated
      destination. Unwilling targets are allowed a saving throw as normal.</p>

      <p>A teleport trap lasts for 10 minutes per caster level before becoming
      inert. This is a magical trap with a Perception DC and Disable Device DC
      equal to the teleport&#8217;s save DC. You may only have one teleport trap
      active at a time. You may select this talent multiple times. Each time
      this talent is gained beyond the 1st, increase the total number of
      teleport traps you may have active at one time by 1.</p>
