      <p>You may imbue a target&#8217;s shadow with the power of your darkness
      magic. As shadow ability, you may spend a spell point to cause a
      target&#8217;s shadow to wrap itself around the target, creating a band of
      supernatural darkness across their eyes, rendering the target blinded. The
      blindfold lasts as long as you concentrate to a total of 1 round per
      caster level, but you may spend an additional spell point as a free action
      to allow the effect to endure for this duration without concentration.
      Darkvision has no effect on this blindfold, but creatures with the see in
      darkness ability are immune.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if a talent is usable as both a (darkness) and (blot),
      you may now use it as if it also possessed the (shadow) tag. Talents used
      in this fashion cost an additional spell point to use and have a duration
      of 1 round per caster level.</p>
