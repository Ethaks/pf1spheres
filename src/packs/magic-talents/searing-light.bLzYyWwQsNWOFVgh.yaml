    value: >
      <p>You may create bright light that burns targets in its area. All
      creatures in the area suffer 1 point of fire damage per caster level per
      round they are within this area of bright light. Undead, oozes, and
      creatures harmed by daylight take 2 points of fire damage per caster
      level. This does not affect the target of the glow itself.</p>

      <p>Creatures who have a glow placed directly upon them (or their
      equipment) augmented by the Searing Light talent may as a full-round
      action attempt a Reflex save to extinguish the bright light, causing the
      glow to shed only normal light for the remainder of the effect and
      preventing further damage caused by Searing Light.</p>
