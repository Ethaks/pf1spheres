      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((metal) package, (plant)
      package), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>As an instantaneous effect, you may as a standard action spend 2 spell
      points to permanently grant the effects of living steel to a metal
      creature or object whose size is no larger than the ore that you may
      recover. Living steel repairs damage to itself at a rate of 2 hit points
      per day, or 1 hit point per day if it has the broken condition. In
      addition whenever the wielder of a metal weapon rolls a natural 1 on an
      attack roll against a creature wearing living steel armor or wielding a
      living steel shield, the item must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or
      gain the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition,
      it is instead destroyed. Living steel cannot damage adamantine weapons in
      this way.</p>
