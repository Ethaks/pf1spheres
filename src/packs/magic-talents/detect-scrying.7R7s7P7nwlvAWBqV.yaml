    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to detect the scryings of others. Any
      attempt to scry or divine on a location or creature within close range of
      you (unless you purposefully lower this defense) becomes impossible unless
      the caster succeeds in a magic skill check against you. In addition, you
      sense if any creature within range is using the divine ability or a
      divination spell, as well as the location of any sensors in the area (such
      as with the Viewing talent or the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell). You
      become aware of any attempt to scry on you, such as with a divination
      (scrying) school spell or the Scrying advanced Divination talent. If these
      spells and effects originate within your sense&#8217;s area, you
      immediately know their location. Otherwise, if you match or exceed the
      other caster in an opposed magic skill check, you gain a visual image of
      the diviner and know their direction and distance from you. You may
      suppress or resume this sense as a free action.</p>
