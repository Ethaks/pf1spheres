      <p>While control weather deals in manipulating large weather patterns, a
      shroud is an expression of extremely localized weather, usually only large
      enough to effect a single target.</p>

      <p>You may activate a (shroud) talent as a standard action, placing that
      shroud on a single creature within your control weather range. Placing a
      shroud on a target is subject to spell resistance, but a target does not
      get a saving throw to resist the application of a shroud. Shroud effects
      persist as long as the caster concentrates. The caster may always spend a
      spell point as a free action to allow the effect to continue for 1 round
      per caster level without the need for concentration.</p>

      <p>Unlike control weather, shrouds produce no lasting effects; any rain
      evaporates immediately ice disappears when it leaves the target, etc.
      Shrouds do not counter the prevailing effects of the local weather (for
      example, Karakaze does not protect against the effects of Heat), but are
      also not affected by them (for example, Glare functions even in complete
      darkness and Heat Stroke works even in arctic levels of Cold).</p>

      <p>When a creature is affected by two or more shrouds of the same weather
      type (such as Aridity or Heat) or is affected by a shroud and is in an
      area of the shroud&#8217;s weather type of severity level 3 or above, it
      suffers an additional effect depending on the shroud&#8217;s type. If a
      shroud has more than one weather type, it can trigger the added effect of
      any of its types. Regardless of the number of shrouds affecting a target,
      any additional effect only affects them once per round. The saving throw
      DC and the caster level for any additional effect are equal to that of the
      shroud affecting them. If a target is affected by multiple shrouds with
      different DCs and caster levels, use the highest DC and caster level for
      the additional effect (even if the highest caster level and highest DC are
      from different shrouds).</p>

      <h5 id="toc13"><span>Shroud Additional Effects</span></h5>

      <p><strong>Aridity:</strong> The target takes a -4 penalty to its
      Constitution score, which may not reduce its Constitution score below 1.
      It may attempt a Fortitude save (at its unpenalized Fortitude save bonus)
      at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for one round.</p>

      <p><strong>Cold:</strong> The target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls,
      concentration checks, and AC. It may attempt a Will save at the beginning
      of each turn to ignore this penalty for one round.</p>

      <p><strong>Fallout:</strong> The target takes 1 point of bleed damage for
      every 5 caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Heat:</strong> The target takes a -4 penalty to its Strength
      score, which may not reduce its Strength score below 1. It may attempt a
      Fortitude save at the beginning of each turn to negate this penalty for
      one round.</p>

      <p><strong>Precipitation:</strong> Each round at the beginning of its turn
      the target must succeed at a Reflex save or treat the square it starts in
      as difficult terrain. They also take a -4 penalty to Acrobatics and Climb
      checks, and to CMB and CMD.</p>

      <p><strong>Wind:</strong> Each round at the beginning of its turn the
      target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be moved 1d6 x 5 feet in a
      random direction. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. If the
      target cannot move this far (such as if a wall or other creature is in the
      way) it takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet not traveled (minimum 1d6) and falls
      prone.</p>
