If targeting a creature, the target is allowed a Will save to resist being viewed, which is subject to the following modifiers depending on your knowledge and connection to the desired creature. Creatures or objects on a different plane receive an extra +5 bonus to their Will save. If viewing an object, the object may attempt a save (if intelligent), or any creature holding the object, or that could be considered to &#8216;possess&#8217; the object is allowed to attempt this save on its behalf. If no such creature is available, assume a default Will save of 15.</p>\n<strong>Table: Familiarity (Scrying)</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Knowledge</th>\n<th>Will Save Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>None^</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Secondhand (you have heard of the subject)</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Firsthand (you have met the subject)</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Familiar (you know the subject well)</td>\n<td>-5</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>^You must have some sort of connection (see below) to a creature of which you have no knowledge</p>\n<strong>Table: Connection (Scrying)</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Connection</th>\n<th>Will Save Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Likeness or picture</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You have one of the creature&#8217;s possessions, or have a person present who once owned the object</td>\n<td>-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You possess a piece of the subject (body part, lock of hair, broken fragment, etc.)</td>\n<td>-10</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject) as if you were present.
