      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Ghost Sight
      (sense)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 3 spell points to gain a special sense that grants the
      ability to see into and through solid matter within close range, with the
      viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if
      there is no illumination. Unobscured Vision, despite the name, can be
      blocked by dense materials as if it were a divine talent or ability.</p>
