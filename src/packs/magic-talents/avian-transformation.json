At 5th caster level, the target gains a fly speed of 40 ft. with maneuverability (average). This improves by +20 ft. per 5 additional caster levels, and one maneuverability category per 10 additional caster levels.<br>\n<strong>Natural weapons:</strong> 2 talons (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small)<br>\n<strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>\n<strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft.</p>\n<p>Avian Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two talon attacks as those granted by Avian Transformation. This may be granted once per pair of legs the creature possesses. The target must possess wings or another means of being airborne to attack with talons.</li>\n<li>Two wings and its flight speed as that granted by Avian Transformation.</li>\n<li>Two wing attacks (secondary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3 Small) May be given once per pair of wings possessed.</li>\n<li><strong>Hover:</strong> The target can halt its movement while flying, allowing it to hover without needing to attempt a Fly check. If the target is Large or larger and hovers within 20 feet of the ground in an area with lots of loose debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a radius of 60 feet. The winds generated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other small, open flames of non-magical origin. Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet. Creatures have concealment at 15 feet to 20 feet (20% miss chance). At 25 feet or more, creatures have total concealment (50% miss chance, and opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature). (Requires wings and a fly speed)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Maneuverability:</strong> The target&#8217;s flight maneuverability improves by one step, +1 per 10 caster levels. (Requires a fly speed)</li>\n<li><strong>Wingover:</strong> Once each round, the target can turn up to 180 degrees as a free action without attempting a Fly check. This free turn does not consume any additional movement. (Requires a fly speed)</li>\n</ul>\n",
