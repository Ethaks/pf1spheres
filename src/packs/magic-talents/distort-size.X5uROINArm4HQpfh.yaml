    value: >
      <p>You distort the target&#8217;s spatial footprint, causing them to
      occupy a smaller or larger area. You may add or subtract 5 feet to the
      space they occupy (so an enlarged Medium creature would occupy a 10-foot
      cube instead of a 5-foot cube, and a shrunken Gargantuan creature would
      occupy a 15-foot cube instead of a 20-foot cube). You can alter the
      target&#8217;s space by an additional 5 feet for every 4 caster levels you
      possess. This does not change the target&#8217;s size category for any
      purpose such as reach, damage, or modifiers, though their reach does
      extend from the new space they occupy. If you would shrink the
      target&#8217;s space below a 5-foot cube, you instead halve their space
      for each 5 feet you would normally subtract, rounding down to the nearest
      half foot (a Medium creature shrunk by one step would occupy a 2-1/2-foot
      cube, or a 1-foot cube if shrunk by two steps) (minimum 1-foot cube).</p>

      <p>You may alter the target&#8217;s space anywhere from their normal size
      as a swift action each turn (or as part of a concentration action). When
      you use this ability on a target, you can also grant them control,
      allowing them to spend a swift action to change their space each turn
      following the same rules.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts for as long as you concentrate, but you may spend a
      spell point to maintain it for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration.</p>
