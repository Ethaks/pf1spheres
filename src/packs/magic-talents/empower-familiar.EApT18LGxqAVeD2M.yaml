    value: >
      <p>If your companion possesses the familiar companion archetype, you may
      spend 1 spell point as a standard action to increase its Hit Dice to the
      amount it would normally have without this archetype. These additional Hit
      Dice remain for as long as you concentrate (using the same action normally
      used to concentrate on a companion) and any decisions about feats or
      ability score increases from these additional Hit Dice are made when this
      talent is selected.</p>

      <p>If you spend 1 additional spell point, your companion retains these
      additional Hit Dice for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.
      Any talent which would extend the duration of your summons (such as
      Greater Summoning or Lingering Companion) similarly extend the duration of
      this transformation. Any additional feats or ability score increases
      gained from these additional Hit Dice are determined when you select this
      talent and may be changed when you gain a level.</p>
