      <p>By concentrating your telekinetic powers on an area you may effectively
      increase or decrease the area&#8217;s gravity. As a standard action you
      may alter the gravity of a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per five caster levels
      sphere anywhere within range of your telekinesis. As long as you
      concentrate, the area becomes either an area of heavy gravity or an area
      of light gravity. You may also change the type of gravity in the area as a
      move action. This talent can be used to alter areas that are already heavy
      or light gravity, either altering them to normal gravity or doubling their
      effects, but cannot be used in areas of no gravity or subjective gravity.
      You may spend a spell point to sustain this effect with Sustained
      Force.</p>

      <p><strong>Heavy Gravity:</strong> In heavy gravity areas, Acrobatics,
      Climb, Ride, and Swim checks incur a -2 circumstance penalty, as do all
      attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect
      a character&#8217;s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character&#8217;s
      Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters that fall in
      areas of heavy gravity take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen,
      to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Light Gravity:</strong> Characters in an area of light gravity
      gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and on Acrobatics and Ride
      checks. All items weigh half as much, and weapon ranges double. Strength
      and Dexterity do not change as a result of light gravity, but what you can
      do with such scores does change. Falling characters in light gravity take
      1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d4).</p>
