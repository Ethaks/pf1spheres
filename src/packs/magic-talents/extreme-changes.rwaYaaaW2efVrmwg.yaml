      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alteration sphere (Greater Changes),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>Increase the number of traits you may apply with your shapeshift by 1.
      This stacks with the increase from Greater Changes. This talent may be
      taken once, then one additional time at 10th caster level and every 10
      caster levels thereafter. Its effects stack.</p>
