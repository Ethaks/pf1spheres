      <p>You may spend an additional spell point to use your cure or restore
      ability on yourself as a swift action. You cannot use this to shorten an
      ability that has a casting time of more than a standard action, and you
      cannot affect any creature other than yourself with this ability. You may
      spend an additional spell point to do this even if you are normally unable
      to cast due to a condition you can restore.</p>
