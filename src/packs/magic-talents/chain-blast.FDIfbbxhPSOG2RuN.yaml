      <p>You may spend a spell point to arc your destructive blast between
      multiple targets. Choose a number of targets no greater than 1 + half your
      caster level (minimum 2 targets total). Make a ranged touch attack against
      each of them in order. No target can be farther than 10 feet + 5 feet per
      5 caster levels from the previous target and no target can be targeted
      more than once. Should any of the targets fail to take damage, either by a
      missed attack, resistances, or other method, the chain stops and no
      further targets are damaged.</p>
