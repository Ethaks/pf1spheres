      <p>When you use the Gust Of Wind ability, you may create a cone area of
      effect instead of a line. Additionally, you gain the following geomancing
      abilities:</p>

      <p><strong>Absorbing Inhalation:</strong> Concentration. You may, as a
      standard action, grant your lungs inhuman strength and capacity, allowing
      you to harmlessly and completely inhale one gas, fog, smoke, mist, or
      similar cloud-like effect during the duration of the talent. The
      cloud-like effect can have no larger of a radius than 10 feet + 5 feet per
      5 caster levels. If the targeted cloud is a magical effect, you must
      succeed at a magic skill check to inhale it. Inhaling the cloud removes it
      from the area, leaving normal breathable air in its place. Gaseous
      creatures gain a Reflex save to avoid being inhaled. This talent can only
      affect an instantaneous-duration cloud (such as a breath weapon) if you
      ready an action to utilize the talent in response.</p>

      <p>You may keep the cloud harmlessly contained within you for as long as
      the talent remains active, but you must hold your breath to do so (even if
      you do not normally have to breathe).</p>

      <p>If the cloud has a duration, the time the cloud is contained within you
      counts toward that duration (gaseous creatures are immediately and
      harmlessly exhaled should their gaseous form expire in the nearest empty
      space). As a standard action, you may release the stored cloud as a breath
      weapon, filling a 60- foot cone (or the cloud&#8217;s original area, if
      smaller). Any creature in the breath&#8217;s area is subject to its normal
      effects, attempting saving throws and spell resistance checks as
      appropriate against the cloud&#8217;s original DC. The exhaled cloud
      resumes its duration, if any. Exhaling the stored cloud immediately ends
      the duration of this talent. If you do not exhale the cloud before this
      talent&#8217;s duration expires, you suffer the cloud&#8217;s effects,
      automatically fail any saving throw made to resist it, and exhaling any
      gaseous creatures inhaled into the nearest empty space.</p>

      <p><strong>Feather Fall:</strong> Concentration, requires air. You cause
      all falling creatures or objects within a 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels radius to fall slowly, changing the rate at which they fall to a
      mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet).
      The targets take no damage upon landing while this talent is in effect.
      Once applied, this effect stays with the individually affected targets
      until the duration expires. You may use this ability as an immediate
      action by spending a spell point.</p>
