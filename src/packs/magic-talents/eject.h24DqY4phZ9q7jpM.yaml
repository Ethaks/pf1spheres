    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to attempt to eject a creature from time
      itself for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). The creature
      disappears completely and cannot be the target of any damage or effect
      while it is vanished. When the effect ends, the creature returns in the
      exact spot it disappeared from (or the closest unoccupied square). From
      the target&#8217;s perspective no time has passed, and any effect already
      on the target with a duration (such as magic or poison) continues as if
      the time spent ejected simply had not happened. An ejected creature can
      attempt a new saving throw each round as a full-round action to end this
      effect early.</p>
