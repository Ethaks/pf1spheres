      <p>You can analyze information with a glance. As a swift or move action
      you can read up to 500 words or analyze a complex work of art, value an
      item with Appraise, get a hunch or sense enchantment with Sense Motive,
      search for tracks with Survival, or intentionally search with
      Perception.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point as a swift action you can make passive
      analysis effortless for 1 hour per caster level. You no longer need to
      spend an action for any of the following: reading up to 1000 words,
      analyzing complex art, rolling Appraise to value an item after handling or
      touching it, rolling Sense Motive to sense enchantment when an enchanted
      creature passes within close range (this check should be made in secret by
      the GM), and rolling Sense Motive to make a hunch after one round speaking
      to them. In addition, you may more rapidly perform tasks that require
      continual analysis, allowing you to follow tracks at any speed without
      penalty or perform research in half the usual time.</p>

      <p>At a GM&#8217;s discretion, other similar skill checks and uses can
      benefit from this talent.</p>
