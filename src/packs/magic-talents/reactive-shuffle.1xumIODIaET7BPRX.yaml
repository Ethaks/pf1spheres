      <p>You may use your Shuffle ability as an immediate action in response to
      a sphere effect being cast, or a supernatural effect being used, but you
      must spend 2 spell points to do so, and the ability only affects that
      particular casting or use of the ability.</p>

      <p>If you use this talent to modify your own spells as they are cast, or
      that of a willing creature, you instead only need to spend 1 spell
      point.</p>
