      <p>You may spend a spell point to have your shapeshift deal 1d6 per two
      caster levels (minimum 1d6) untyped damage to all targets that fail their
      save against the shapeshift. You may add the following traits to your
      forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Flesh Pocket:</strong> You rearrange internal organs and
      muscles to create a pocket inside the target&#8217;s body, usually in the
      abdomen. The opening to the pocket resembles a large scar. The pocket can
      hold creatures and objects up to two sizes smaller than the target. The
      target gains a +20 circumstance bonus to concealing items in their flesh
      pocket.</p>

      <p><strong>Seal Eyes:</strong> The target must succeed at a Fortitude save
      or have its eyes sealed, blinding it.</p>

      <p><strong>Twist Legs:</strong> The target must succeed at a Fortitude
      save or have one movement speed reduced by 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels (minimum 5 feet).</p>

      <p><strong>Vocal Theft:</strong> The target becomes unable to speak and
      may not supply vocal spell components or attempt Perform checks that
      require singing or speaking.</p>

      <p><strong>Wrench Stomach:</strong> The target must succeed at a Fortitude
      save or be sickened while the shapeshift lasts or for a number of rounds
      equal to your caster level, whichever is shorter. If you spend an
      additional spell point, the target is instead nauseated on a failed save
      and sickened for one round on a successful save.</p>
