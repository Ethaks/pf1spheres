      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fallen Fey sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>As a full-round action, you may steal the skin of a creature of Small,
      Medium, or Large size with a roughly humanoid shape. The target creature
      must be dead, helpless, or willing. If the target creature is alive, you
      must make a successful coup de grace attack to steal its skin. Should the
      creature survive this, it is nauseated as a pain effect, takes
      Constitution bleed of 1d4, bleed damage equal to three times your caster
      level, and takes a -10 penalty on saves against disease until its skin is
      regrown by regeneration or a similar effect. Should this bleed damage be
      halted by any means, it restarts in 1d4 rounds.</p>

      <p>You then may don or remove the stolen skin as a move action. When
      wearing a stolen skin, you take on the likeness of the skin&#8217;s
      original owner, including the victim&#8217;s voice, build, and size, but
      gain none of the creature&#8217;s abilities. The stolen skin grants you a
      +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature, with none of the
      usual penalties for different gender, race, age, and size. Stolen skins
      are preserved for the duration of the fey-blessing and remain as supple as
      living skin. You may only have a single skin stolen at a time; stealing
      another forces you to discard any previously stolen skins. Discarded skins
      rot and decay normally. Discarded skins may not be reused.</p>
