      "value": "<p>You can make a melee touch attack against a living creature up to your size to attempt to absorb it into your body, similar to the swallow whole ability (Reflex negates).</p>\n<p>Being absorbed causes a creature to take negative energy damage each round equal to 1d6 + 1d6 for every three caster levels you have (undead are not affected). An absorbed creature gains the grappled condition, while you do not. An absorbed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get free is equal to 1/10 your total hit points), or it can just try to escape as if escaping a grapple (using your CMD or your MSD, whichever is higher). The armor class of your interior is 10 + 1/2 your caster level, with no modifiers for size or Dexterity. If an absorbed creature cuts its way out, you cannot use this talent again until the damage is healed.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can touch a corpse or undead that you control as a move action to absorb it into your body or to expel an absorbed corpse or undead into an adjacent square. While absorbed, an undead cannot use any of its senses or take any actions, and time passes normally - corpses rot and reanimate&#8217;s duration continues to pass.</p>\n<p>You can have a number of corpses or controlled undead absorbed at a time equal to 1 plus 1 for every 3 caster levels you have. You can spend a spell point to expel all absorbed corpses and undead with a single swift action. While you have at least one undead absorbed, you give off an aura that can be detected by Divine Undead equal to the highest Hit Dice undead absorbed, but your appearance is not otherwise changed.</p>\n<p>Creatures and bodies storied within your tomb of flesh are stored in an extradimensional space; you do not increase in size no matter how many creatures and bodies are stored inside you.</p>\n",
