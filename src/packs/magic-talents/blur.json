      "value": "<p>As a trick you may designate a single 5-foot cube as a figment that distorts perception. This distortion lasts for one round per caster level. Any effect originating from a source whose line of sight begins inside or crosses this area incurs a 20% miss chance + 5% per caster level (maximum 50%) due to concealment. Any creature may attempt a Will save as a free action once per round to ignore this miss chance for 1 round. You may only have one such disruption at a time. Using this trick a second time immediately end the duration of the previous casting of this trick.</p>\n<p>As an illusion you may create a distorting figment. This creates a figment that causes a distortion as described above.</p>\n<p>As an illusion you may create a distorting glamer. This functions in all other ways as the trick except it does not allow for a Will save to ignore the miss chance and has the duration of a standard illusion. As a glamer, the miss chance only applies to attacks made against the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Blurs created with this talent do not need to be visual, or purely visual; They can incorporate elements that distort other forms of perception based upon what (sensory) talents you possess. A creature can ignore the miss chance granted by blur if they lack senses for every (sensory) effect you incorporate into the effect; A purely visual blur can have its miss chance ignored by a creature that closes its eyes. To determine if a sense is sufficiently possessed by a creature when determining if they can ignore the miss chance provided by the blur effect, they must be capable of pin-pointing the space of a creature only using that sense; For example, humans do not normally qualify as possessing the necessary senses to pin-point a creature by smell or taste alone (unless they gain other senses such as scent, keen scent, or some forms of blindsense).</p>\n",
