      <p>When causing a glow effect to shed normal light or bright light, you
      may shape this light into strange shapes as a free action. It illuminates
      an area that you form of a number of 5-foot cubes, with each cube placed
      adjacent to the target of the glow or another cube. For normal light you
      may place up to 20&#160;5-foot cubes, and with bright light you may place
      up to 30, plus another for each 2 caster levels you possess. The light 20
      feet away from any square of this area (or 30 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster
      levels away if shedding bright light) is increased by one step to a
      maximum of normal. With the Intensity Control talent you may add an
      additional 5-foot cube per 5 feet of radius you would add to your area,
      and increase or decrease the radius in which light is increased by 10
      feet. You may change the light&#8217;s area or return it to its normal
      area as a free action, but for the purpose of (light) talents you may only
      affect one area per round.</p>
