      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You peer not only through space, but through time. You may spend one
      minute and a spell point to view the past of your present location out to
      close range, viewing the past hour. You gain full sensory information
      based on the senses you possess. You may concentrate on this effect,
      viewing an additional hour further in the past for each minute of
      concentration. You are considered flat-footed while concentrating on this
      effect.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Mass Time talent, you may share this sight with a
      number of willing creatures within your alter time range as defined by
      that talent. Such creatures are also flat-footed for the duration, though
      they may choose to exit the vision at any time.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Ranged Time talent, you increase the area you may
      view by one step per time it is taken (close to medium, medium to long).
      If Ranged Time is taken three times, your viewing area increases to line
      of sight.</p>

      <p>At caster level 8th, you may spend an extra spell point to view days
      instead of hours, each day requiring 10 minutes. At caster level 16th, you
      may spend 2 additional spell points to view years instead of hours, each
      year requiring 1 hour.</p>
