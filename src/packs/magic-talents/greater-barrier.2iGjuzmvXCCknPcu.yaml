      <p>You may fashion your barrier into a flat plane if you so choose. This
      wall must be contiguous and must begin adjacent to you, although it may
      extend as far out as close range (if you possess the Distant Protection
      talent, it must begin within close range and be contained within medium
      range), and can cover up to 1&#160;10-foot square per caster level. This
      flat plane may be arranged vertically, horizontally, or along whatever
      angle you choose. In addition, when creating a barrier, you may spend an
      additional spell point to increase its Hit Points to 10 per caster level,
      double its maximum weight, and increase the Break DC by 10. The
      barrier&#8217;s hit points do not replenish, even if maintained through
      concentration.</p>
