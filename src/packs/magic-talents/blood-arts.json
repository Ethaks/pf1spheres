      "value": "<p>The Blood and Portents handbook introduces a new set of Blood sphere talents marked (blood art). These talents grant a Blood sphere caster the ability to cast blood arts, which briefly manipulate or transfigure blood.</p>\n<p>You may use blood as a catalyst to create effects known as blood arts. Casting a blood art is a standard action, unless otherwise stated, and has a range of close. As part of casting any blood art, either the caster&#8217;s or the target&#8217;s blood is briefly manipulated, causing that creature to suffer a small amount of damage known as &#8220;blood loss&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Blood loss is inflicted on the creature whose blood is manipulated by a blood art in addition to but separate from any of the blood art&#8217;s normal effects. A creature who suffers blood loss takes untyped damage equal to 1/2 the blood art caster&#8217;s Blood sphere caster level (minimum 1). This damage cannot be prevented and bypasses any temporary hit points the target may possess.</p>\n<p>A creature who cannot suffer blood loss cannot be the target of a blood art. Targets that gain immunity to bleed damage from their creature type, subtype, or a template cannot suffer blood loss. Creatures that gain immunity to bleed damage from other sources are susceptible to blood loss, but still benefit from their immunity against bleed damage. Some creatures that are normally immune to bleed damage but that frequently feed on blood may be susceptible to blood loss. Any creature that has used the blood drain universal monster ability in the previous hour or any creature composed largely of blood (such as a blood golem) may suffer blood loss. Other appropriate creatures may also suffer blood loss, at the GM&#8217;s discretion.</p>\n<h5 id=\"toc5\"><span>Author's Note: \"What Exactly Is Blood Loss\"</span></h5>\n<p>Blood loss is an additional \"cost\" associated with a blood art. It is damage, but it is not the sphere effect's damage. It cannot be modified, increased or interacted with like a sphere effect's regular damage or effects. Metamagic contingent on an effect dealing damage to a target, such as the Dazing Spell metamagic, would not consider or treat the blood loss mechanic as the sphere effect's damage. Suffering blood loss as part of casting a blood art does not force the caster to make a concentration check.</p>\n",
