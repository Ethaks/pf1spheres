      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Shadow Reaver:</strong> You do not cast a shadow. When you kill
      a living creature with CR of at least half your Hit Dice that has a
      shadow, you gain 1 temporary spell point that expires after 1 minute and
      cast the shadow of that creature until the spell point is lost.</p>

      <p><strong>Steal Shadow:</strong> You may spend a spell point when
      attempting a Steal attempt against a creature that has a shadow, stealing
      its shadow instead of any item if successful. Creatures who have their
      shadows stolen gain 1 temporary negative level and lose 1 spell point.
      This loss increases by one die size (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.) for every
      five caster levels. Creatures who would be reduced below 1st level instead
      suffer a -2 penalty to Constitution per negative level. Creatures that
      possess spell slots instead lose spell slots, based on the level of the
      slot, as detailed in the Introduction chapter.</p>

      <p>You gain an equal number of temporary spell points that expire after 1
      minute, though cannot gain more spell points than the target loses. These
      temporary spell points do not stack with spell points from other targets,
      other instances of this ability, or any other source and expire after one
      round per caster level. This ability does not grant a way to use spell
      points to those that lack one.</p>

      <p>You may restore shadows as a standard action, removing the negative
      level(s). Shadows are restored automatically at the end of your fey-link,
      or may be reclaimed by a Steal maneuver at any time or as a standard
      action with a touch if you are helpless or unconscious.</p>
