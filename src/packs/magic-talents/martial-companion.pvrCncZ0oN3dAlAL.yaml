      <p>This archetype requires Spheres of Might. A martial companion may
      combine combat spheres and talents to create powerful martial techniques.
      Martial companions use the Proficient talent progression. When first
      summoned, they may choose either Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom as their
      practitioner modifier. A martial companion does not gain the evasion,
      devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion special abilities. A martial
      companion may choose to give up the natural attacks granted by its base
      form to gain the Battle Creature (form) talent as a bonus talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> This does not inherently grant a martial
      tradition, although some companions may qualify to trade things for a
      martial tradition.</p>
