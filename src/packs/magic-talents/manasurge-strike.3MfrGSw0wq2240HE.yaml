    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you can make one ranged or melee attack using a
      weapon. If the attack successfully hits, you may choose to trigger an
      (expunge) or (manipulation) talent normally cast as a standard action or
      less, and that only targets the creature you hit as a free action even if
      they are normally out of range or the talent allows to affect more than
      one creature.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the Counterspell feat, you may
      use it as part of using this talent, treating the counterspell as if it
      were an (expunge) talent.</p>
