      "value": "<p>You may grant the following traits to your forms:</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Form:</strong> The target counts as an undead creature when determining if it is healed or harmed by positive or negative energy, such as from a cleric&#8217;s channel energy class feature or the Life sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Resistances:</strong> The target gains a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, and stunning, increasing by +1 per 10 caster levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Skin:</strong> The target gains DR 5/bludgeoning or DR 5/slashing. This improves by 1 per 5 caster levels. At 10th caster level, this may be changed to DR/silver or magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Drain:</strong> At 10th caster level, the target may be granted the blood drain special quality (1d2 Constitution; this improves by 1 die size for each 5 caster levels beyond 10th).</p>\n<p><strong>Fear Aura:</strong> At 10th caster level, the target may be granted the fear aura special quality (30 feet, always active, creatures entering the area must succeed at a Will save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Charisma modifier or be shaken for as long as they are inside the aura; once a creature saves against this effect, they are immune for 24 hours).</p>\n<p><strong>Incorporeal:</strong> You must spend an additional spell point and have at least 15th caster level to apply this trait. The target may be made incorporeal with the following modifications: The target retains all worn equipment not exceeding his maximum load as well as the benefits from any magic items that grant a continuous effect, but gains no benefit from physical armor or shields, and cannot make attacks against corporeal creatures unless using a weapon with the ghost touch special ability. The target takes half damage from non-magic weapons instead of no damage, and non-force effects originating from corporeal sources that do not deal damage have a 20% chance to fail instead of the normal 50%. The target uses normal movement speeds (treat moving through solid objects as ground movement), and in open air the target falls slowly, and may glide with a speed of 30 feet with maneuverability (perfect), falling 1 foot for every 5 feet traveled (unless possessing a fly speed).</p>\n",
