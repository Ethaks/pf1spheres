      <p>As a free action you may cause any glow within your range to shed
      non-visible light. While shedding non-visible light, a glow does not
      outline a creature with light, impose a Stealth penalty, or increase light
      levels within its radius. However, (light) talents applied to the glow
      still function as if it was shedding light in its normal area.</p>

      <p>A glow shedding non-visible light functions normally even in magical
      darkness and does not hinder the function of magical darkness in the same
      area. No magical skill check is made when a glow under the effects of
      Black Light interacts with magical darkness.</p>
