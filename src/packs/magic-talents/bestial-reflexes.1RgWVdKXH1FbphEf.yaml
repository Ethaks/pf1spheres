      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Lunge:</strong> Choose one natural attack the target possesses.
      As a full-round action, the target may make a single attack action at
      double its normal reach with that natural weapon with a +4 bonus to its
      attack roll.</p>

      <p><strong>Leaping Attack:</strong> As a standard action, the target may
      jump, making a single attack action at any point during the leap. It does
      not provoke an attack of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.</p>

      <p><strong>Pounce:</strong> The target may make a full-attack after a
      charge. Granting this trait costs an additional spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Trample:</strong> As a full-round action, the target may move
      up to its move speed, moving over and dealing slam damage (1d6 + 1-1/2
      Strength modifier Medium, 1d4 + 1-1/2 Strength modifier Small) to any
      creatures smaller than itself. Creatures affected by the trample can make
      an attack of opportunity, but at a &#8211;4 penalty.</p>

      <p>If they forgo an attack of opportunity, they may attempt to avoid the
      target, attempting a Reflex save for half damage (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice +
      Str modifier). A trampling creature can only deal trampling damage to each
      target once per round, no matter how many times it moves over that
      creature.</p>
