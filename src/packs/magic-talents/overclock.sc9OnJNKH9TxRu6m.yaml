      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere (Control Oxygenation
      (quicken, still)), caster level 18th.</p>

      <p>When using the (quicken) option of Control Oxygenation, you may spend
      three additional spell points to grant the target an additional standard
      action each round for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution
      modifier (minimum 1 round) or until your blood control ends, whichever
      comes first. In any round the target uses this extra action it takes 1d4
      Constitution burn. This damage increases to 1d6 if the target is fatigued
      and to 1d8 if the target is exhausted. The target is exhausted at the end
      of this effect. This additional standard action cannot be used to cast a
      spell or sphere effect.</p>
