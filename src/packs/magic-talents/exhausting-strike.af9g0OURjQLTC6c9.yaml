      <p>The subject of your ghost strike becomes fatigued for 1 round per
      caster level (Fortitude negates). You may spend a spell point to increases
      this effect to making the target exhausted for 1 minute per caster level
      (Fortitude negates). On a successful save, the target is still fatigued
      for 1 round. Unlike regular fatigue and exhaustion, these conditions end
      as soon as the duration expires.</p>

      <h2 id="toc2"><span>Reanimate</span></h2>

      <p>As a standard action, you may touch an intact dead body and spend a
      spell point to reanimate it as a zombie or skeleton (depending on the
      composition of the body in question) for 1 minute per caster level. This
      creature gains the zombie or skeleton template and obeys your commands,
      although only basic commands such as &#8220;go&#8221;, &#8220;stay&#8221;,
      &#8220;follow me&#8221;, &#8220;attack&#8221;, or &#8220;guard&#8221; are
      understandable. While specifics can be given (&#8220;guard this area
      against humans but let goblins pass&#8221;), undead are unintelligent and
      easily fooled.</p>

      <p>A reanimated body cannot speak and has no knowledge or ability to think
      and so cannot answer questions or reveal anything it knew in life. When
      the duration expires, the body collapses until reanimated again. It does
      not regain hit points between reanimations. If reduced to 0 hit points,
      the body collapses and is destroyed; it cannot be reanimated again.</p>

      <p>You may have a total number of reanimated creatures active at any one
      time whose combined Hit Dice does not exceed twice your caster level. If
      you attempt to reanimate a creature that would push your total beyond this
      limit, you must choose which creatures cease to be reanimated or are
      released from your control. You cannot reanimate a creature with more Hit
      Dice than twice your caster level. Temporary increases to caster level
      (such as from implements or the thaumaturge&#8217;s forbidden lore class
      feature) do not increase the statistics, maximums, or number of undead the
      caster controls.</p>

      <p><strong>Animate Dead:</strong><br>

      Undead created through the Death sphere count against the total number of
      undead that can be controlled by the <em>animate dead</em> spell, if using
      both spells and spheres in the same game.</p>

      <p>Some Death talents are designated (ghost strike), which provide you
      with additional types of ghost strikes.</p>
