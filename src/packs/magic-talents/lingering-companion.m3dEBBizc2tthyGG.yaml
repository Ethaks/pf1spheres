    value: >
      <p>When you spend a spell point to allow this companion to remain for 1
      minute per caster level without concentration, you may spend an additional
      spell point to allow it to remain for 1 hour per level instead. If you
      also possess the Greater Summoning talent, your companion instead remains
      for 1 day or until you rest to regain spell points, whichever comes first.
      Once you have spent a spell point to summon such a creature for a full
      day, you may dismiss and re-summon this companion at will without having
      to spend any additional spell points that day.</p>
