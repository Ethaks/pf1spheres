      <p>You flood your target with disturbing sensations</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You cause the target to become sickened
      for 1 round per caster level (Will negates).</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> You cause a target to become nauseated
      for 1 round per caster level (Will negates). On a successful save, they
      are still sickened for 1 round per caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This is the same as the greater charm,
      except the target becomes stunned for 1 round in addition to being
      nauseated. On a successful save, they are still sickened for 1 round per
      caster level.</p>
