    value: >
      <p>You may cause a location or object to radiate a cloud that invites or
      repels either creatures of a given type (such as monstrous humanoids or
      outsiders with the fire subtype), a specific kind of creature (such as
      blue dragons or red-furred hobgoblins), or creatures of a specific
      alignment (such as lawful neutral creatures).</p>

      <p>If the effect is used to invite creatures, they feel elated and pleased
      to be in the area of the effect, or desire to touch or possess the
      affected item. They have an overpowering desire to stay in the area or
      remain in contact with the item. If the effect is used to repel creatures,
      they feel an urge to leave the area or avoid the object in question. The
      creatures will actively shun the area and not willingly return to it while
      the talent&#8217;s effect is active.</p>

      <p>If a save to resist the invitation effect is successful, the creature
      is unaffected, but they must reattempt the save after 1d6 x 10 minutes if
      they are still within range and the effect is still continuing.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Cloud:</strong> The lure effect can invite or repel
      creatures of up to 1/2 your caster level in Hit Dice (Will negates). The
      effect applies to any creature who comes within close range of the effect.
      The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Cloud:</strong> As the lesser cloud, except it can
      affect creatures of up to your caster level in Hit Dice, applies to any
      creature who comes within medium range of the effect, and lasts for a
      number of hours equal to your caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Cloud:</strong> As the lesser cloud, except the lure
      effects creatures of up to twice your caster level in Hit Dice, applies to
      any creature who comes within long range of the effect, and lasts for a
      number of days equal to your caster level. Casters with the Ranged Mind
      talent may extend the range to extreme range (1,000 feet + 100 feet per
      level). Casters with both the Ranged Mind talent and the Zeitgeist
      advanced talent may make the lure&#8217;s effect cover either 1
      mile/caster level, or communities of up to 10,000 or smaller.</p>
