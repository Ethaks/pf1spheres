      <p>You may spend a spell point or increase your teleport casting time by
      one step in order to make a single attack after successfully teleporting
      yourself. You may also spend an additional spell point to make either a
      full attack or take an attack action instead of a single attack after
      successfully teleporting. You may not use this talent in conjunction with
      any abilities or conditions that reduce the action needed to teleport
      (such as Emergency Teleport or Quick Teleport).</p>
