    value: >
      <p>Vog of severity level 2 and 3 act as mist and fog. Starting at severity
      level 4 it also causes all in the area to become sickened until it leaves
      the area (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous
      save). For each severity level above 4, the DC increases by 2. At severity
      level 6, all within the area are nauseated as long as they remain in the
      area and for 1d6+1 rounds after they exit. At severity level 7, they also
      suffer 1d6 Constitution damage per round as they inhale poisonous gas
      (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous save).</p>

      <p>Vog is a type of volcanic weather, and thus requires the Volcano Lord
      advanced talent to create.</p>
