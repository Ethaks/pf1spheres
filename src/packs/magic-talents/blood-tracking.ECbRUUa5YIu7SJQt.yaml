      <p>You are always aware of creatures under the effects of your blood
      control or an effect causing bleed damage, or at or below half hit points
      within blood control range and may pinpoint such a creature&#8217;s square
      as a free action. Creatures that would be immune to your blood control
      cannot be detected by this ability.</p>

      <p>This talent may be taken a second time; doing so grants you the
      benefits of blindsight, though this ability is still limited to the listed
      creatures.</p>
