      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere, Weather sphere
      (Radiation Lord (advanced)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, causing their technological
      and magical equipment to fail. Whenever a creature affected by this shroud
      attempts to use technological or magical equipment that uses charges or
      spell points, there is a 20% chance that the item does not function
      (charges and spell points are still used up, however). This chance of
      failure increases by 10% at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
