    value: >
      <p>Enemies within this totem must succeed at a Will save, or become
      distracted by hallucinations at the edge of their perception. If they
      fail, any of the caster&#8217;s allies threatening them are considered to
      be flanking them. This lasts as long as are in the totem, ends if they
      leave the totem, and resumes if they reenter the totem. They do not get a
      new saving throw if the leave and then reenter the totem area. This is a
      mind-affecting illusion (phantasm) effect, and creatures with blindsense
      or blindsight automatically succeed at their saving throw.</p>
