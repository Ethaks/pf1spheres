      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mana sphere (Essentialize
      (manipulation)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>By spending an additional spell point, you may use Essentialize as an
      immediate action on a sphere effect as it is being cast with a -5 penalty
      to the attempt. If you possess the Counterspell Mastery feat, the penalty
      is reduced to 0. The targeted effect need not be harmless if you use
      Essentialize in this way, but this effect costs an additional spell point
      if the target is not harmless. You may treat instantaneous effects as if
      they had a duration of at least one minute for the purpose of how many
      temporary spell points are gained.</p>
