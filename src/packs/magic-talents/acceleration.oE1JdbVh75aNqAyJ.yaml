      <p>When you move a target with telekinesis you can double the distance you
      can move it that turn by having all of its movement be in a straight line.
      An object that moves at least 10 feet this way before being used as a
      Bludgeon is counted as having made a charge and gains the related +2 on
      its attack roll. If you also possess the Dancing Weapon talent, you may
      apply charge-related feats and combat talents to your charge with that
      Bludgeon.</p>
