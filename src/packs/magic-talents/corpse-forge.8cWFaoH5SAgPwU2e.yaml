      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Corpse Manipulation),
      caster level 3rd.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you can destroy one undead you reanimated and
      control within your dominion range to add its Hit Dice to another undead
      you reanimated and control within range. The creature receiving the
      benefit of this talent does not gain any other abilities of the sacrificed
      creature beyond the increase in Hit Dice, although its own abilities are
      recalculated using the higher Hit Dice. Add their current hit points
      together (to a maximum of their new total hit points), and use the longer
      of their durations. The resulting undead can have Hit Dice above 20, but
      still cannot possess Hit Dice greater than twice your caster level. When
      the reanimate duration ends, all combined corpses separate into their
      original forms.</p>
