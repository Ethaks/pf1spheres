    value: >
      <p>When an ally within range fails a saving throw, you may spend a spell
      point as an immediate action to allow them to reroll it using your
      modifier. Alternatively, when you fail a saving throw, you may spend a
      spell point as an immediate action to reroll it using the modifier of an
      ally within range. If they or you still fail, whatever effect required
      your ally to attempt that saving throw affects your ally and you as if
      both of you had been the target, had been in its area of effect, or were
      subject to its ongoing effect. If the saving throw was to end an ongoing
      effect and a failure has no penalty other than the effect remaining, you
      (if your ally rerolled the saving throw) or your ally (if you rerolled the
      saving throw) are affected by it until the end of your next turn.</p>
