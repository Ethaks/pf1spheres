      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere, caster level 1st.</p>\n<p>Like alternate divinations, this advanced talent grants additional divinations depending upon what other spheres you know. Unlike alternate divinations, however, this advanced talent grants new sense abilities instead of divine abilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Creation: Material Sense:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points to gain material sense, automatically detecting the presence of a single material you could create or alter within close range as if you could see it (the material is chosen when you cast this sense). A character can use material sense to distinguish color or visual contrast so long as the distinct components are perceptible if one can only see the specific materials sensed (for example, a character who selects ink with material sense could read documents written in ink but could not see goldfoil illuminations). However, the character is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character can detect creatures who have the material as part of their body but does need line of effect to detect objects made of the material. Material Sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark: See in Darkness:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points to gain the see in darkness ability. The creature can see perfectly in all darkness, including magical darkness that otherwise might obstruct darkvision.</p>\n<p><strong>Death: Spirit Sense:</strong> You may spend a spell point to gain the spirit sense ability, which allows you to know when immortal or deathless beings are nearby. You automatically sense the presence of undead; fey; outsiders; and astral, ethereal, or incorporeal creatures within close range, as if you could see them. A character cannot use spirit sense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive noncreature nonliving material using spirit sense but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Spirit sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Life: Lifesense:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points to gain lifesense, automatically detecting the life force of beings within close range as if you could see them. A character cannot use lifesense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive nonliving material or nonliving creatures (such as constructs or undead) using lifesense, but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Lifesense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind: Thoughtsense:</strong> You may spend a spell point to gain the thoughtsense ability. You automatically detect and locate conscious creatures within close range who you could target with your Mind sphere abilities as if you could see them.</p>\n<p>If you spend an additional spell point, you may detect and locate all types of conscious creatures, not just those that you could affect with mind-affecting effects. Nondetection, Unplottable, and similar effects block thoughtsense.</p>\n<p>Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and nonsentient (Intelligence 1&#8211;2) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects. Creatures lacking an Intelligence score, or with a score less than 1, cannot be detected or located with thoughtsense unless you have selected that creature&#8217;s type with the Recondite Stimuli talent. A character cannot use thoughtsense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. A character cannot perceive nonliving material using thoughtsense, but does need line of effect to detect creatures. Thoughtsense can be foiled by illusions with the Implausible Deniability feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Telekinesis: Touchsight:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points to gain the touchsight ability. You gain the ability to &#8220;feel&#8221; your surroundings even when your sight would otherwise be obscured by your physical environment. Your touchsight field emanates from you out to close range. You ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment, though you must have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. You automatically detect and pinpoint all creatures within close range as if you could see them. In many circumstances, comparing your regular senses to what you learn with touchsight is enough to tell you the difference between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed creatures. A character cannot use touchsight to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense. Touchsight can be foiled by illusions with the Illusionary Touch talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Weather: Storm Vision:</strong> You may spend a spell point to gain a special sense granting the ability to negate any concealment, miss chance, and penalties to Perception directly caused by weather such as rain or fog (be they magical or natural).</p>\n",
