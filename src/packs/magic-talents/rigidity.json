      "value": "<p>You can spend one spell point to manipulate how rigid an object is. You cannot alter an object that is larger than you can create and the normal restrictions apply. This talent has no effect on gases or liquids, or creatures without hardness as a defensive ability.</p>\n<p>Increasing an object&#8217;s rigidity improves its hardness by up to 1 per two caster levels (minimum +1), but decreases its hit points by 2 per inch per point of hardness increase, as the object&#8217;s structure becomes harder, but is in turn more prone to shattering. Objects cannot be reduced to less than 1 hit point (walls cannot have less than 1 hit point/inch of thickness), and the bonuses to hardness stop when the minimum amount of hit points is reached.</p>\n<p>Decreasing an object&#8217;s rigidity lowers its hardness by up to 1 per 2 caster levels (minimum -1), but increases its hit points by 2 per inch per point of hardness lost, as the object&#8217;s structure becomes more flexible, but it is no longer as able to resist damage as the original. Objects cannot be reduced to a hardness lower than 0, and the bonuses to hit points stop when the minimum hardness is reached. This effect lasts for one minute per caster level.</p>\n<p>If you possess Lengthened Creation you may use it to extend the duration as normal. You may affect a created object with rigidity with the same action used to create the object.</p>\n",
