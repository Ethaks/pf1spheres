      "value": "<p>You grant the form of a humanoid creature with your shapeshift.<br>\n<strong>Limbs:</strong> 1 head, 2 arms, 2 legs<br>\n<strong>Speech:</strong> Yes; <strong>Hands:</strong> Yes<br>\n<strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft. land speed.<br>\n<strong>Natural weapons:</strong> none<br>\n<strong>AC:</strong> none<br>\n<strong>Special:</strong> The target can speak and gains knowledge of one language you also speak. If the target&#8217;s Intelligence is lower than 6 (including 0), it is increased to 6. If the target is normally immune to mind-altering effects due to not possessing a mind, this negates that immunity.</p>\n<p>If you so choose, you may forgo applying additional traits to the target. Instead, you may allow the target to retain its natural attacks, special abilities, and movement types that were dependent on its previous form, in essence making the target a hybrid between a humanoid and its previous form.</p>\n<p>If this form is being applied to a creature that is already an intelligent humanoid or a creature of a similar makeup, this instead works as the Blank Transformation, but the creature may undergo cosmetic changes without costing a trait. Additionally, you may choose up to two traits from Blank Transformation and/or a single (transformation) or (body) talent that you possess that do not grant natural attacks and apply them to the target, as if it were part of this form. These traits are for all purposes not considered to be traits.</p>\n<p>Anthropomorphic Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gift of Hands:</strong> Up to two limbs the target possesses of a single category (arms, legs, tails, etc.) now end in grasping fingers, which can wield weapons, perform dextrous actions, and fulfill somatic components for magic. If used on a pair of legs belonging to a quadruped, the quadruped gains the ability to walk normally on only two legs.</li>\n<li><strong>Gift of Mind:</strong> If the target&#8217;s Intelligence is lower than 6 (including -), it is increased to 6. If the target is normally immune to mind-altering effects due to not possessing a mind, this negates that immunity.</li>\n<li><strong>Gift of Speech:</strong> The target may speak and supply verbal spell components normally, even if in a form that would normally prevent this.</li>\n</ul>\n",
