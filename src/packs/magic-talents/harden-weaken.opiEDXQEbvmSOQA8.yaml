    value: >
      <p>You may enhance an object to either increase or decrease its hardness,
      or enhance a creature to grant it or lessen its damage reduction. You may
      increase or decrease an object&#8217;s hardness by an amount equal to your
      caster level (minimum 1). Decreasing an object&#8217;s hardness gives it
      the fragile quality if it does not already have it. When targeting a
      creature, you may either grant it DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 your caster
      level (minimum 1), or decrease its current damage reduction by the same
      amount. This only affects damage reduction that can be bypassed (so it
      could decrease DR/cold iron, but not DR/-).</p>
