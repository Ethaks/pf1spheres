      <p><sup><strong>Note:</strong> This talent has been errata'd and replaced
      Elemental Transformation, Dedicated.</sup></p>

      <p>You may grant the form of an elemental with your shapeshift.<br>

      <strong>Limbs:</strong> mutable (up to 1 head, 2 legs, 2 arms, chosen when
      form is granted)<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> Yes; Hands Yes (if arms granted)<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft. land speed<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> 2 slams (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft. If you spend an additional
      spell point when granting this form, the target also gains a 25% ability
      to ignore critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 5
      caster levels to a maximum of 100%.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the target gains one of the following packages depending
      on what kind of elemental is being mimicked. Each elemental package notes
      separately the granted movement, including abilities related to that
      movement, and abilities:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Air: Movement:</strong> The target takes no damage when
      falling and may glide, moving with a speed of 30 feet with maneuverability
      (good), falling 1 foot for every 5 feet traveled. At 5th level, this
      improves to a 30 feet fly speed with maneuverability (good).
      <strong>Abilities:</strong> The target gains energy resistance to
      electricity equal to your caster level and the Elemental
      Transformation&#8217;s whirlwind trait as a bonus trait (which does not
      count against the number of traits the caster may apply with their
      shapeshift).</li>

      <li><strong>Earth: Movement:</strong> The target gains a 30 feet burrow
      speed and tremorsense 20 feet. <strong>Abilities:</strong> The target
      gains energy resistance to acid equal to your caster level and the target
      gains a +2 natural armor bonus, which stacks with other sources of natural
      armor.</li>

      <li><strong>Fire: Movement:</strong> The target gains a 40 feet land speed
      (this replaces the land speed granted by the base form).
      <strong>Abilities:</strong> The target gains energy resistance to fire
      equal to your caster level and the Elemental Transformation&#8217;s burn
      trait as a bonus trait (which does not count against the number of traits
      the caster may apply with their shapeshift).</li>

      <li><strong>Water: Movement:</strong> The target gains a 30 feet swim
      speed and can breathe water freely. <strong>Abilities:</strong> The target
      gains energy resistance to cold equal to your caster level and the
      Elemental Transformation&#8217;s whirlwind trait as a bonus trait (which
      does not count against the number of traits the caster may apply with
      their shapeshift).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Elemental Transformation offers the following traits, which you may
      apply to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Air Mastery:</strong> Airborne creatures take a penalty on
      attack and damage rolls against the target equal to -1 - 1 per 10 caster
      levels.</li>

      <li><strong>Burn:</strong> The target gains the burn universal monster
      ability (1d6, Reflex DC equal to the caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC)
      with their natural weapons, unarmed strikes, or manufactured weapons. The
      burn universal monster ability&#8217;s damage increases by 1 size per 5
      caster levels (1d8, 2d6, 3d6, 4d6, etc.).</li>

      <li><strong>Earth Mastery:</strong> The target gains a bonus on attack and
      damage rolls if both the target and its opponent are touching the ground
      equal to +1 + 1 per 10 caster levels.</li>

      <li><strong>Elemental Empowerment:</strong> Choose acid, cold,
      electricity, or fire. The target&#8217;s first successful attack each
      round made with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or manufactured weapon
      deals additional damage of the chosen energy type equal to your caster
      level.</li>

      <li><strong>Elemental Movement:</strong> Choose air, earth, fire, or
      water. The target gains the chosen elemental package&#8217;s movement from
      the Elemental Transformation talent and any abilities related to that
      movement (such as air&#8217;s glide, earth&#8217;s tremorsense, or
      water&#8217;s ability to breathe underwater). If fire is chosen and the
      target lacks a land speed, the target gains a base land speed of 40 feet.
      You may grant this trait multiple times, each time choosing a different
      elemental package&#8217;s movement.</li>

      <li><strong>Elemental Resistance:</strong> Choose acid, cold, electricity
      or fire. The target gains energy resistance to the chosen energy type
      equal to your caster level. You may grant this trait multiple times, each
      time choosing a different energy type. Energy resistance from this trait
      does not stack.</li>

      <li><strong>Water Mastery:</strong> The target gains a bonus on attack and
      damage rolls if both the target and its opponent are touching water equal
      to +1 + 1 per 10 caster levels.</li>

      <li><strong>Whirlwind:</strong> If the target possesses a fly speed, the
      target gains the whirlwind universal monster ability. If the target
      possesses a swim speed, the target gains the water elemental&#8217;s
      vortex ability. The target may use the whirlwind and vortex abilities
      at-will, and can transform as a standard action. If the target possesses
      both a fly speed and a swim speed, the target may freely enter and exit
      water while transformed and is considered to be in whichever form is most
      suitable for each space the whirlwind or vortex would occupy. The Reflex
      DC for the whirlwind and vortex abilities granted by this trait is equal
      to the caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC. The whirlwind and vortex is
      always 5 feet wide at its base, and its maximum height is equal to the
      target&#8217;s size + 1 size category larger per 5 caster levels (maximum
      Colossal) on Table: Whirlwind Trait Sizes. A whirlwind or vortex&#8217;s
      width at its peak is equal to half its height. The target can control the
      exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet high. If a target&#8217;s
      size is smaller than Small, the target is considered to be Small-sized for
      this trait. (Requires fly or swim speed)</li>
