      <p>You shed light like a torch. You may alter the color, extinguish, or
      resume this effect as a free action. If you possess the Light sphere, you
      may count as being under the effects of your own glow while this
      fey-blessing is active.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may create a light that sheds light like a
      torch within medium range. You may move this light 30 feet + 5 feet per 2
      caster levels per round as a move action, though it must stay within range
      of you. This light persists for the duration of the fey-link or until you
      create another one.</p>

      <p>You may choose to have either your light or the moveable light shed an
      enchanting glow. Creatures within a 30-foot radius of the light must
      succeed on a Will save or be fascinated. A creature that successfully
      saves is immune to your use of this ability for 24 hours. If a creature
      fails its saving throw, it approaches to stand adjacent to the light and
      follows it if it moves. As normal, fascinated creatures suffer a -4
      penalty to Perception, but cease to be fascinated if attacked or
      approached with an obviously hostile intent, such as someone drawing a
      weapon. This is a mind-affecting effect. You may alter the color or
      dismiss the light as a free action.</p>
