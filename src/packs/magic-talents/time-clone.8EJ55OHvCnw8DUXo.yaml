      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You draw a version of the target from an alternate timeline to assist
      you on the battlefield by spending a number of spell points equal to 1/2
      the target&#8217;s total Hit Dice (minimum 1). Activating this ability
      informs the caster of how many spell points it will cost for their
      intended target; if they do not have enough spell points, the action is
      wasted but no spell points are spent.</p>

      <p>This copy lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level
      and appears in a square adjacent to the target and acts immediately on
      your turn, moving and acting as you direct it (a free action). The copy
      shares all of the target&#8217;s statistics (including current spell
      points after the talent is used and other limited-use abilities), movement
      speeds, and abilities, including equipped items (but not consumable or
      limited use items such as potions, wands, and scrolls), but its tether to
      this timeline is tenuous and the copy instantly vanishes if it takes any
      damage or fails a saving throw against any spell or effect. Any items the
      time clone may have possessed instantly disappear when the target is
      destroyed or when the duration of this effect ends. You must succeed on a
      melee touch attack (or a ranged touch attack if you possess the Ranged
      Time talent) to use this ability on an unwilling target, and they are
      allowed a Will saving throw against this effect; on a successful saving
      throw this ability fails and any spell points spent on it are wasted.</p>

      <p>Time clones created with this talent cannot create additional time
      clones or similar copies of themselves.</p>
