    value: >
      <p>When you use your telekinesis to make a Bludgeon attack, you may
      continue to move the object after the attack roll is made if it has any
      movement remaining. This means you may make multiple Bludgeon attacks in a
      round, though not more than you would normally be allowed with your base
      attack bonus, and applying penalties for full attacks as normal. You may
      choose to forfeit any remaining movement in order to make a full attack
      with a single Bludgeon against a single target. If you possess the Dancing
      Weapon talent, you may gain extra attacks from feats and combat
      talents.</p>
