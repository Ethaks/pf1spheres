      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 10 minutes and 3 spell points to enhance the body part of
      a touched creature so that it functions as if it were connected to the
      rest of the body regardless of where it is. For example, if you were to
      use this effect on an eye and remove it from a person&#8217;s skull, the
      owner would still be able to see out of that eye. A detached hand or arm
      could still manipulate objects on its own. Organs separated from the body
      are typically objects 2 sizes smaller than the creature they belong to and
      do not have any bonuses to AC. They are considered to have a Strength
      score equal to half of their owner. Any damage dealt to an organ is
      transferred to the organ&#8217;s owner. If an organ has some sort of
      mobility (such as a hand crawling or a head pushing itself around using
      its tongue), the organ is considered to have a movement speed of 5 feet.
      You use your own actions to move this organ. A creature takes no damage
      when an organ affected by this talent is removed or when it is reattached
      (a standard action which requires that the owner touch the organ). If you
      reattach an organ to your body, the effects of this ability remain,
      allowing you to freely detach it again.</p>

      <p>Creatures may remove vital organs such as hearts, and lungs from their
      body and hide them elsewhere. Each organ removed in this way gives the
      creature a cumulative 10% chance to negate critical hits and precision
      damage against them as per the fortification armor special ability. This
      effect is cumulative, but does not stack with any similar effects such as
      fortification armor. This talent may safely remove one organ from a
      creature per 4 caster levels. A creature may not have their brain removed
      with this talent.</p>

      <p>Removal or detachment of organs through this talent are permanent until
      dismissed or dispelled. If this effect is dispelled (which requires the
      organ be targeted with the dispel rather than the person the organ
      belonged to), the organ teleports back to the owner&#8217;s body so long
      as the distance between the owner and the organ does not exceed your
      teleport range (or close range if you cannot teleport). If the organ could
      not teleport back its owner or is beyond this range, the organ explodes
      harmlessly and the caster painfully grows a replacement, taking 2d6 points
      of Constitution drain in the process (or taking 10d6 damage which cannot
      be reduced or redirected if they are immune to ability drain or lack a
      Constitution score).</p>
