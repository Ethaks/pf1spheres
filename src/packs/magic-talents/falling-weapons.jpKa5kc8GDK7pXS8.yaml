    value: >
      <p>Weapons deal their normal damage instead of their object size damage
      when dropped on a target and their damage is not multiplied for hardness,
      although it is still multiplied for distance. Falling weapons are never
      treated as indirect siege weapons, and always target AC rather than touch
      AC. Dropping a giant spike is the same as dropping a greatsword.</p>
