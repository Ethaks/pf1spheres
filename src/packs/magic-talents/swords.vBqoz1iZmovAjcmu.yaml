    value: >
      <p>You actualize the target&#8217;s power to bring about action. When
      granted as a motif, the target gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls. This
      bonus increases by +1 for every 10 caster levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect as an immediate action and become
      unerring in purpose. For the next minute, the target ignores any miss
      chance due to concealment. Once during this effect&#8217;s duration, when
      the target threatens a critical hit, the target may choose to gain a bonus
      on their attack roll to confirm that critical hit equal to 1/2 your caster
      level (minimum 1). This effect may not be combined with any ability or
      effect that automatically threatens critical hits.</p>
