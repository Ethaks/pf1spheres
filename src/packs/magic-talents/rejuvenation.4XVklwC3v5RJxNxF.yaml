      <p>As a standard action, you may heal yourself an amount equal to 1/2 your
      caster level (minimum 1) per round for as long as you concentrate. This
      healing only functions if you have 1/2 your maximum hit points or less.
      You may spend a spell point to grant yourself fast healing equal to 1/2
      your caster level (minimum 1) for 1 minute per caster level, but this fast
      healing also only confers healing so long as you have 1/2 your maximum hit
      points or less.</p>
