    value: >
      <p>You can alter a corpse in one of the following ways by touching it as a
      standard action:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You grow flesh on a decomposed or skeletonized corpse, providing it
      with sufficient flesh that it can be animated as a zombie rather than a
      skeleton. The corpse looks as it did just before death. The new flesh is
      not fit for eating.</li>

      <li>You decompose the flesh from a corpse, leaving behind a perfectly
      cleaned skeleton.</li>

      <li>You can spend a spell point to touch a collapsed or destroyed undead
      corpse, mending it so it is a valid target to be reanimated again.</li>

      <li>You can spend a spell point to preserve the remains of a dead creature
      for 1 day per caster level so that they do not decay. Doing so effectively
      extends the time limit on raising that creature from the dead. Days spent
      under the influence of this spell do not count against the time limit.
      Additionally, this makes transporting a slain (and thus decaying) comrade
      less unpleasant. This ability also works on severed body parts and the
      like.</li>

      <li>You can reshape the dead body to look like another creature or even a
      specific person so long as you have firsthand knowledge of how that
      creature or person actually looks. You can make the corpse one size larger
      or smaller or change its apparent type, gender, or age. Attempt a Disguise
      check to determine how convincing the change is, though you may substitute
      your caster level for ranks in Disguise if desired.</li>

      </ul>
