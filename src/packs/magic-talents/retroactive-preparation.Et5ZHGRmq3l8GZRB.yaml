      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to edit the past,
      retroactively obtaining a generic object, such as a mundane item or a
      commonly-available magic item such as a healing potion, worth less than
      100 gp per caster level. The object immediately appears on your person or
      in a container or extradimensional space attended by you. The cost of the
      item is immediately deducted from the wealth (usually coins, but can be
      nonmagical gemstones or other nonmagical objects used for trade) you
      currently carry.</p>

      <p>You cannot obtain an object worth more than you have the wealth to
      purchase. The object must be one that would have been available in a
      settlement you have visited within the past 1 week per caster level.</p>
