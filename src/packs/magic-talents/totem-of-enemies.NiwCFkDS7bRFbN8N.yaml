      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a totem of enemies. Choose an
      end of the alignment spectrum (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you
      create the totem. Creatures within the area of this totem who possess that
      alignment suffer a -1 penalty to all saving throws and attack rolls. This
      penalty increases by 1 per 10 caster levels. You must select an alignment
      that you do not possess. If you are chaotic neutral, lawful neutral,
      neutral evil, or neutral good, you may select true neutral with this
      totem.</p>
