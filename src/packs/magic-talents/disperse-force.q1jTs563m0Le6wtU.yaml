      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere (Quick Reactions,
      Telekinetic Push), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You can apply an opposing force at the right times, canceling out
      offensive forces. As an immediate action whenever you would take damage,
      you may spend two spell points to negate that damage. You may use this to
      respond to energy or magic based attacks, and you may even use it to
      insulate you against environmental hazards (such as acid rain or lava) but
      it is ineffective against damage from internal or nonphysical sources
      (such as bleed damage or a mental attack).</p>
