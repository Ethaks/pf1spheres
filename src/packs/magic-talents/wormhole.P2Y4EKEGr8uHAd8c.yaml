      <p>You touch a single 5-foot square and link it to another 5-foot square
      within close range of it to which you have line of sight and line of
      effect, contracting the space between them. You may connect an additional
      5-foot square per 2 caster levels anywhere within range as well. Anyone
      may choose to use 5 feet of their movement to travel in a straight line
      between two linked squares as if they were adjacent (though they are not
      treated as adjacent for any other purpose). This wormhole lasts as long as
      you concentrate, but you may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for
      1 round per caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>If you possess Ranged Warp more than once, this also increases the
      maximum distance between the touched squares (allowing you to place
      squares within medium range of one another if Ranged Warp has been taken
      twice, or long range if taken three times).</p>
