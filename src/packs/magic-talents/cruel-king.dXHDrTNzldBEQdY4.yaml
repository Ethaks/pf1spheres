      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mana sphere (Flow (manabond), Vassalize
      (advanced)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When using the Vassalize advanced talent, you may target creatures that
      do not normally possess a spell pool. When doing so, your sphere effects
      are fueled by their mental capacity: On a failed save, they suffer a -1
      penalty to all of their mental ability scores for each spell point needed
      to cast your sphere effect for 24 hours, and you may cast the sphere
      effect without paying its regular cost. You may use this talent as long as
      none of the creature&#8217;s mental ability scores would become penalized
      to 0 due to the penalties bestowed. Any attempt to utilize this talent in
      such a way causes the effect to fail, and the action to be wasted.</p>
