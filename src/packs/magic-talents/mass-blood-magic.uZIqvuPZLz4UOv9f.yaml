    value: >
      <p>When using a blood art, blood control, or a (quicken) or (still)
      ability, you may spend an additional spell point to affect an additional 1
      creature per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) at the same time. Each target
      must be within range and must be affected by the same effect. For a
      casting that initiates blood control, this additional cost is only
      incurred once; it is not paid a second time for the free (quicken) or
      (still) ability. Once created, each blood control is considered a separate
      sphere effect.</p>
