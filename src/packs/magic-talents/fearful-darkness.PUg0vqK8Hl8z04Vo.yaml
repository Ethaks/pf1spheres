      <p>You may create a darkness or blot effect that plays with the fears of
      any who enter it. Creatures within this area of darkness or blot must
      succeed at a Will save or become shaken. Creatures who succeed at this
      save but remain in the darkness must save again at the end of your
      subsequent turns. If any creature enters this area of darkness, they must
      immediately save or become shaken. When a creature fails their saving
      throw, they remain shaken for as long as they remain within the area of
      darkness +1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
