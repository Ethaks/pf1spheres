      <p>Whenever you perform a Bludgeon, instead of making an attack roll, you
      may choose to swing the Bludgeon in a sweeping arc at the target. The
      target must succeed at a Reflex save or both the target and the Bludgeon
      take damage depending on the Bludgeon&#8217;s size. If you possess the
      Dancing Weapon talent, you may use abilities which would apply additional
      damage or effects to a single attack action to the Bludgeon damage dealt
      to the target with this talent. If an effect would impose a penalty to an
      attack roll, such as Lancer sphere impale or the Power Attack feat, you
      instead reduce the DC of the Reflex saving throw by that amount.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you possess the Dancing Weapon talent,
      your Bludgeon damage could include additional damage from a Berserker
      sphere brutal strike, Duelist sphere blooded strike bleed damage, or the
      Vital Strike feat, but not other attack actions or effects which do not
      affect the Bludgeon&#8217;s damage, such as barrage or dual attack. Attack
      actions or effects which do not affect the Bludgeon's damage, such as
      barrage or dual attack, instead apply a penalty to the Bludgeon's saving
      throw.</p>
