      <p>As a standard action you may gain a rough understanding of a
      target&#8217;s language. You can grasp basic concepts (such as
      &#8216;danger,&#8217; &#8216;help,&#8217; or &#8216;wait&#8217;) but not
      complex details. This also allows you to communicate in the same language
      as long as you continue concentrating, though with the same limitation to
      basic concepts. The effects of this last for as long as you
      concentrate.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point, you may understand and communicate in a
      target&#8217;s language without any limitations and maintain the effect
      without concentration for 1 hour per caster level. The effects of this
      talent apply to all mediums of communication (such as spoken, signed, or
      written) but you only understand the mediums you observe (so you cannot
      write a language you have only heard, or speak a language you have only
      read).</p>
