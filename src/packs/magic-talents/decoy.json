      "value": "<p>As a trick you may create an illusionary creature in the same square as a real creature, called a decoy. A decoy may perform any of the following actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Coaxing Decoy:</strong> The decoy immediately moves up to the speed of your figments in any direction unimpeded. The coaxing decoy is immune to damage and vanishes at the end of your turn. If the movement of the coaxing decoy would provoke an attack of opportunity from a creature, that creature must succeed at a Will save or use it on the coaxing decoy.</p>\n<p><strong>Defensive Decoy:</strong> The decoy follows and occupies the same square as the target. Anyone attempting to attack the target must succeed at a Will save or suffer a 50% miss chance. On a miss caused by this effect the attacker targets the illusionary creature instead, dissipating it. The decoy is unaffected by area attacks. Defensive decoys last 1 round per two caster levels (minimum 1) or until struck with a single target effect.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as an illusion you may create a glamer that surrounds a target with a number of defensive decoys equal to 2 +1 per 3 caster levels. As long as one or more defensive decoys remain, the target gains a 50% miss chance.</p>\n<p>If you possess the Complex Illusions talent, one or more of the defensive decoys granted by the glamer may act as the coaxing decoy trick. Once per round as a free action you may instruct one or more decoys to move up to 5 feet per 2 caster levels independently of the original target, provoking attacks of opportunity as a coaxing decoy, then disappearing.</p>\n",
