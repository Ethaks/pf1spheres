      <p>By spending a spell point when you alter or create an object, you may
      work with gaseous materials. You may create gases or change their
      composition into any other known substance with Change Material. A 5-foot
      cube equals a Medium creation. Half a cube equals a Small creature, but
      this decreases the DC of any created gaseous effect by 2 and halves any
      damage from harmful gases for any creature within that space. You must
      have line of sight to accomplish this, and as such cannot alter the air in
      a creature&#8217;s lungs or other, similar situations.</p>

      <p>As you gain caster levels, you also gain the ability to make more
      dangerous gases as detailed in the table below. Vacuums cannot be altered
      or created, and gases cannot be destroyed by damaging effects. Creatures
      standing in a square filled with unbreathable air must hold their breath
      or suffer the effects of suffocation, following the normal rules for doing
      so.</p>

      <p>A half-filled square of non-transparent gas obscures sight beyond 10
      feet. Any creature behind more than 10 feet of squares half-filled with a
      gas has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). A square filled with
      a gas obscures sight beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has
      concealment and creatures further away have total concealment (50% miss
      chance and attackers cannot use sight to locate the target). If a square
      is filled with a condensed gas (by treating a single square as a Large
      object) it obscures vision as above and is difficult to move in, halving
      movement speed of all creatures within it as well as imposing a -2 penalty
      to melee attack and damage rolls, preventing normal ranged attacks (siege
      weapons and magic attacks function normally), and treats anyone standing
      in a harmful gas as if they were exposed to it twice. (For example, taking
      double damage from acidic vapors, or two doses of poison from poisonous
      fumes.)</p>

      <p>A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses any altered or created gas in 4
      rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the gas in 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is not designed
      to be a perfect simulation of reality, and attempting to interject
      real-world physics and chemistry into it is often disastrous. As such, the
      gases that may be altered or created have been simplified from what their
      real world counterparts would be. If you wish to create a more specific
      gas, you are encouraged to discuss the matter with your GM - its effects
      should not exceed those of the gases normally available at your caster
      level.</p>
