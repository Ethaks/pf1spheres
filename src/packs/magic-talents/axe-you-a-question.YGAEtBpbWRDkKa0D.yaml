      <p>You utter an ominous question towards the target. The target takes
      damage as though hit by a greataxe appropriately sized to you (Medium
      1d12) and is shaken for a number of rounds equal to half your caster
      level. This damage is not modified by your Strength or any other modifiers
      you may possess which would otherwise apply to a damage roll.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point when casting this sphere effect,
      for a number of rounds equal to half your caster level, whenever an effect
      other than this talent would cause the target to become shaken (such as
      being demoralized with the Intimidate skill), the target take damage as
      though hit by a greataxe appropriately sized to you. The target cannot
      take damage this way more than once per round.</p>

      <p>A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a language-
      dependent fear effect.</p>
