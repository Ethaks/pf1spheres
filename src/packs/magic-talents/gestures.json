      "value": "<p>You mentally pull and tug at the target&#8217;s muscles and the aspects of its mind that relate to motor functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You influence the physical gestures made by a target and the actions of the target&#8217;s limbs and extremities (Will negates). You may impose a failure chance on any other magic user whose magic requires a somatic component equal to 10% + an additional 5% for every 5 caster levels (this effect stacks with similar failure chances, such as the arcane spell failure chance that accompanies armor).</p>\n<p>In addition, you may impose a circumstance penalty to any of the target&#8217;s skill checks that would ordinarily be subject to an armor check penalty equal to 2 + 1 per every 5 caster levels. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the lesser charm, you may enforce quick, shambling actions on the target or interruptions of actions the target is taking. You may force the target to pick up or drop an object in a space within its reach, although the target may only be forced to drop things that are held (as opposed to worn or bound in some way). As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, you may make a flat-footed target fall prone, or otherwise make a ranged trip attempt against a target that uses your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your casting ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier. If the target is flat-footed you may cause a check that would be affected by an armor check penalty to automatically fail. Finally, you may also prevent the usage of any magical ability that requires gestures or somatic components.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the lesser and greater charms, you gain nearly full control over the quick gestures and movements of the target. If your target threatens a square where another creature provokes an attack of opportunity, you may force the target to take an attack of opportunity against that target if they have any attacks of opportunity remaining (this counts as one of your attacks of opportunity).</p>\n<p>You may force the target to move up to half of its move speed in any direction that you wish. You may also use the target to provide the somatic components for your own magical effects, and even make the target the origin point of those effects so long as only somatic components are required. (Casters with the Utterances talent may include verbal components with no extra save required). You may also allow this magic to work in either direction, allowing a willing target to control you or vice versa (for example, a friendly rogue might pick a lock that only you can reach using your hands, or you might use your own painting skills to paint a picture through a friendly paladin&#8217;s hands to impress a dignitary).</p>\n",
