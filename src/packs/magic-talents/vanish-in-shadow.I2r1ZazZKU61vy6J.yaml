      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Hide In Darkness (meld)),
      caster level 5th</p>

      <p>When you apply the Hide In Darkness meld to a target, its benefits
      function in any area of dim light or darkness, not just areas of darkness
      you created.</p>

      <p>In addition, when you apply the meld to a target you may spend an
      additional point to completely hide them from detection. Anyone that
      attempts to discern the target&#8217;s location must succeed on the normal
      Perception check to locate them while they are hiding, even those using
      unusual forms of perception such as blindsight or tremorsense or
      Divination sphere effects to directly or indirectly discover their current
      position.</p>
