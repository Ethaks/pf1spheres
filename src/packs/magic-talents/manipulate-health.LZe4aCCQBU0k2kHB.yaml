      <p>As a free action, you may ascertain the general condition of any
      creature under the effects of your blood control according to the list
      below:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Has at least 90% of full normal hit points,
      free of disease.</li>

      <li><strong>Fair:</strong> 30% to 90% of full normal hit points
      remaining.</li>

      <li><strong>Poor:</strong> Less than 30% of full normal hit points
      remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating
      injury.</li>

      <li><strong>Weak:</strong> 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with
      a disease that has reduced an ability score to 5 or less, or
      crippled.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You also know if the creature is suffering from any bleed effects.</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) ability, you may spend a spell point to attempt to force
      a disease out of the target&#8217;s body. This requires a magical skill
      check against the disease&#8217;s save DC. Unwilling targets are allowed a
      Fortitude save to negate this effect. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if
      the target is suffering bleed damage or below one half its maximum hit
      points.</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) ability, you may spend a spell point to force a creature
      suffering from a disease to roll a save against that disease. Success on
      this save does not count toward curing the disease and failing progresses
      the disease.</p>

      <p>As a (still) ability, you may immediately grant a save to a creature
      suffering from a disease. Success on this save counts toward curing the
      disease but failing has no effect. A creature may not be the target of
      this use more than once per day.</p>

      <p>As a (still) ability, you may delay the onset of a disease and to delay
      any saves forced by the disease for the duration of your blood control,
      though at least 1 save against the disease must be attempted every 2 days.
      This does not remove any penalties already inflicted by the disease, it
      only prevents the disease from progressing.</p>
