    value: >
      <p>Whenever you remove a condition completely from a creature using your
      restore ability, they are completely immune to that condition for 2
      rounds. Being immune to a condition does not provide any additional
      defense against more severe versions of a condition, and they can not be
      made immune to a condition they did not have. This may not provide
      immunity to ability damage, ability drain, death, or negative levels.</p>

      <p>Whenever an ally regains hit points from you using your cure ability,
      they gain DR X/- equal to 1/2 your caster level or the number of hit
      points regained (whichever is less) for 2 rounds. This is not compatible
      with any form of fast healing you may grant.</p>
