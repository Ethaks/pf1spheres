      <p>Once per turn when lifting a creature or object with telekinesis
      (referred to as a Bludgeon), you can spend its remaining movement to
      strike a creature or object within its reach.</p>

      <p>This is considered a ranged attack and can benefit from feats or combat
      talents related to weapon and ranged attacks, but does not provoke attacks
      of opportunity except as provoked by the casting of the telekinesis
      itself. Making the attack is a standard action; if the caster is both
      maintaining a telekinesis effect via concentration and making a Bludgeon
      attack, they need only spend a single action to do both, provided it is
      the larger action of the two.</p>

      <p>When you use a Bludgeon to strike a target, you must succeed at a
      ranged attack roll against the target, using your casting ability modifier
      in place of Dexterity for the attack roll.</p>

      <p>On a successful hit, the target and the Bludgeon take damage depending
      on the Bludgeon&#8217;s size. If the Bludgeon is a weapon, the attack
      deals appropriate damage for that weapon (bolts and arrows are treated as
      daggers for this purpose). Since weapons are designed to deal damage, they
      do not suffer damage themselves if used as a Bludgeon. Objects beyond
      Colossal are still treated as Colossal for calculating damage.</p>
