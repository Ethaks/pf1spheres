      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Exquisite Detail),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may touch a single object and, as a full-round action, create a
      perfect duplicate of the object either in your hand or an adjacent square.
      The object is an exact replica in every way, and the only way to tell the
      object is not the original is the lingering Creation aura surrounding the
      object. You must be able to create all of the materials included in its
      construction, otherwise the object created is crafted from materials you
      can create and colored to appear like the original, which could give away
      the ruse. Magical items duplicated are always non-magical but otherwise
      flawless imitations. If you possess Create Materials, you may spend an
      additional 2 spell points to duplicate the object as an instantaneous
      effect, in which case it has no lingering Creation aura.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Fleshcrafting and Bestow Life advanced talents, you
      may create a duplicate of a target creature. This duplicate appears to be
      the same as the original, but it has only half of the real
      creature&#8217;s levels or Hit Dice (and the appropriate hit points,
      feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or
      Hit Dice). You must attempt a Disguise check when you cast the spell to
      determine how good the likeness is (you may use your caster level in place
      of your ranks in Disguise). If you possess Exquisite Detail you may add
      your caster level as a bonus to this check, even if you use your caster
      level in place of your ranks in Disguise. A creature familiar with the
      original might detect the ruse with a successful Perception check (opposed
      by the caster&#8217;s Disguise check) or a DC 20 Sense Motive check to get
      a hunch something is wrong. The duplicate creature is not under your
      control, though it recognizes you are its creator and functions as a
      faithful companion, as described under the Bestow Life talent. Creating a
      duplicate in this manner costs 1 spell point + 1 additional spell point
      for every 3 Hit Dice of the duplicate creature and you may not create a
      duplicate of a creature with more Hit Dice than your caster level. These
      duplicates are incapable of growing in power, but otherwise age as normal
      (if made permanent with Create Materials). No magical effects affecting
      the target are duplicated.</p>
