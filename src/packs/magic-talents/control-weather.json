      "value": "<p>As a standard action, you may control all weather within medium range, adjusting either the wind, temperature, or precipitation levels. If you are in a confined area such as inside a building, your control only extends to the edge of that space.</p>\n<p>This change in weather lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend a spell point as a free action to allow this change to continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. When using control weather to change the weather&#8217;s severity, the change happens 1 level change per category per round until the desired severity is reached. When the effect ends, the severity of the altered weather categories returns to normal by 1 step per round.</p>\n<p>If you are maintaining the effect through concentration, the effect moves with you, raising and lowering the severity of unaffected or no-longer affected area as described above. If it is being maintained through a spell point, it remains stationary.</p>\n<p>Wind has 7 steps of severity, while temperature and humidity have 13. Temperature is divided between &#8216;Heat&#8217; and &#8216;Cold&#8217;, each with 7 steps of severity. (If the temperature is lowered below step 1 of Cold, it becomes step 2 of Heat. If the temperature is lowered below step 1 of Heat, it becomes step 2 of Cold.) Likewise, humidity is divided between &#8216;Precipitation&#8217; and &#8216;Aridity&#8217;, which follows a similar setup. An average day of no wind, no rain, and unremarkable temperature is assumed to be at severity level 1 for all categories.</p>\n<p>At 1st caster level, you may create weather of severity level 1, 2 or 3. This improves by one severity level per 7 caster levels to a maximum of severity level 7. You may create weather of up to this severity, or lower the severity of pre-existing weather if it is within this limit. If the natural weather is of a higher severity level than you can affect, you cannot use control weather to alter that aspect of the weather.</p>\n<p>If two casters are controlling weather in the same location and affecting different categories, both effects happen normally.</p>\n<p>If both casters are affecting the same category, the second caster must be able to affect the weather&#8217;s new severity, and must succeed at a magic skill check to wrestle control from the first caster. On the first caster&#8217;s subsequent turn, if he maintains his own control weather effect, he must succeed at his own magic skill check to wrestle control of the weather back from the second caster. If the first caster is maintaining their effect through a spell point instead of concentration and the second caster succeeds at their magic skill check, the first caster&#8217;s weather effect is suppressed for as long as the second caster uses control weather. Once the second caster&#8217;s effect ends, the first caster&#8217;s effect resumes functioning, provided its duration has not already expired.</p>\n<p>The following is a description of all the different effects one can create with the Weather sphere. See the Pathfinder Core rulebook for more details on weather and environmental effects. Depending on the terrain, a GM could rule additional effects happen; rain can cause rivers or enclosed spaces to flood, Cold can create ice sheets on flat terrain, etc. Generally, weather conditions from different categories stack. (Thus, if Wind, Cold, and Precipitation were all increased to Severity level 5, the area would be under the effects of the appropriate Wind, Cold, and Snow effects, all at the same time.)</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is impossible to raise weather above severity level 7. However, for every effective level above severity level 7 a caster&#8217;s control weather would otherwise be able to reach, all numbers associated with that weather type, including DCs or penalties, are increased by 1.</p>\n<strong>Table: Weather Conditions</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Severity</th>\n<th>Wind</th>\n<th>Cold</th>\n<th>Heat</th>\n<th>Precipitation</th>\n<th>Aridity</th>\n<th>Ash</th>\n<th>Vog</th>\n<th>Fallout</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>Cool</td>\n<td>Cool</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>Chilled</td>\n<td>Warm</td>\n<td>Mist</td>\n<td>Dry</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>Light</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Strong</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n<td>Hot</td>\n<td>Light/fog</td>\n<td>Very dry</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Severe</td>\n<td>Severe</td>\n<td>Severe</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n<td>Parched</td>\n<td>Heavy</td>\n<td>Heavy</td>\n<td>Heavy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Windstorm</td>\n<td>Extreme</td>\n<td>Extreme</td>\n<td>Heavy</td>\n<td>Drought</td>\n<td>Very Heavy</td>\n<td>Very Heavy</td>\n<td>Very Heavy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Hurricane</td>\n<td>Arctic</td>\n<td>Burning</td>\n<td>Flash flood</td>\n<td>Sere</td>\n<td>Suffocating</td>\n<td>Suffocating</td>\n<td>Withering</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Tornado</td>\n<td>Killing</td>\n<td>Boiling</td>\n<td>Great flood</td>\n<td>Desiccating</td>\n<td>Smothering</td>\n<td>Smothering</td>\n<td>Irradiating</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
