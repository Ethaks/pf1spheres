      <p>Your magics create refuge against the dangers of space and planes
      unknown.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>You may create a ward that protects against and grants immunity to
      harmful environmental effects, such as extreme temperatures, toxicity, and
      lack of air. This includes immunity and protection against planar traits
      (such as alignment, energy, magic, and time traits) which would harm or
      weaken a creature inside its radius, but does not negate any benefits of
      the planar trait. This does not protect against environmental effects not
      native to the plane and not caused by a planar trait, such as magical
      weather created with the Weather sphere.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Breathless (aegis) talent, when you grant an aegis
      with the Breathless (aegis) talent, the granted aegis also provides this
      talent&#8217;s immunities and protections against environmental and planar
      traits.</p>
