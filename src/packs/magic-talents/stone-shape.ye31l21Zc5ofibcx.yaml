      <p>You gain a competence bonus on Craft checks equal to your caster level
      for items primarily composed of stone and may craft such objects as if you
      had the appropriate tools.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to turn an adequately
      sized piece of stone into 50 pieces of ammunition, a suit of armor, a
      shield, a tool, or a weapon normally primarily composed of wood or metal.
      Objects created this way have twice their normal weight and weapons gain
      the fragile quality; this quality is retained even when gaining an
      enhancement bonus. You must succeed on the appropriate Craft check to make
      the chosen item as part of this action or else the item gains the broken
      condition, though you may attempt to shape it again. The item is
      considered masterwork and, if a weapon or suit of armor, gains an
      enhancement bonus equal to your caster level/5 (minimum 0).</p>

      <p>Equipment made this way returns to its original form when your fey-link
      ends. Using special types of stone imparts the properties of that stone to
      the shaped object. If using stone taken from a larger piece of stone, the
      larger stone takes damage equal to the hit points of the item (before
      enhancement), ignoring hardness and dealing full damage to objects, which
      can be restored by putting the item back in place and dismissing the
      effect as a standard action.</p>

      <p>You can spend a spell point as a standard action to restore 1d6 +
      caster level hit points to an object made primarily of stone or to a
      construct composed of stone (such as a stone golem).</p>
