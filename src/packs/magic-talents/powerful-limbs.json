      "value": "<p>You may add the following traits to your form:</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Arms:</strong> Choose one pair of limbs the target possesses capable of wielding a weapon. With these limbs, the target may wield weapons of one size larger without penalty. This does not stack with other effects that allow the target to wield larger weapons without penalty, such as powerful build. Additionally, the target increases its overhead lifting capacity by 50%.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Claws:</strong> Choose one natural attack the target possesses (or pair of natural attacks if granted in pairs such as claws, talons, pincers, etc.). The selected attack or attacks deals damage as if it were one size larger. This size increase stacks with other effects that increase actual and effective size, such as the Size Change Alteration sphere talent or the Encompassing Light talent of the Light sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Legs:</strong> The target is always considered to have a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump and treat its move speed as if it were 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels higher when determining the bonus or penalty to jump checks from movement speed. Additionally, the target&#8217;s carrying capacity is increased by 50%.</p>\n",
