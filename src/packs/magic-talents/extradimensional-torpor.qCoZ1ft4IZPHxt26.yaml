      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Extradimensional Storage
      (space)).</p>

      <p>You gain a permanent extradimensional space that can be used to store
      creatures in a state of a deep trance. This space may store up to 6
      creatures at once, plus an additional 1 for every 4 caster levels.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point you can place a creature carrying a light
      load or less into an extradimensional space which puts them into a
      sleep-like state (unwilling creatures gain a Will saving throw to prevent
      this).</p>

      <p>While in extradimensional torpor, the creature is helpless and
      unconscious (this ignores any immunity to sleep), but does not need to
      breathe. Time flows normally in the torpor meaning that continuous effects
      (such as poisons) don&#8217;t stop, and beings in torpor require
      sustenance as normal.</p>

      <p>As a free action, you may release a creature from torpor into an area
      within range of a space effect that's large enough to house it and would
      cause it no harm (any attempt to do otherwise fails automatically).</p>

      <p>Creatures willingly put into torpor can exit torpor at anytime to any
      location they desire within range (despite being unconscious, or being
      under any other modifications such as being under the effects of Stasis
      Storage).</p>

      <p>Unwilling creatures get an additional Will saving throw at the
      beginning of their turn to exit this torpor; if they succeed they can exit
      torpor similarly to willing creatures. If they fail their Will save for 3
      turns in a row, they remain in torpor indefinitely until you release them.
      Creatures gain a +10 bonus to these Will saving throws if they have more
      than 50% of their hit points remaining, and receive a -5 penalty to these
      Will saving throws if they have 10% or less of their hit points
      remaining.</p>

      <p>Creatures stored in this extradimensional space are treated as if they
      were non-living objects stored in extradimensional storage for the
      purposes of effects that modify that space (such as the Stasis Storage
      dual sphere feat).</p>

      <p>If you select this talent a second time, there is no limit to the
      maximum amount of creatures you may store at once, and you may store
      creatures carrying a medium load or less.</p>
