      "value": "<p>Your Alteration sphere abilities allow targets to imitate individual creatures with which you are familiar. The +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks provided by the Alteration sphere applies to Disguise checks to appear as that specific individual.</p>\n<p>This bonus does not stack with the bonus to Disguise checks from similar effects (the disguise self spell, Illusionary Disguise from the Illusion sphere, the Realistic Likeness<sup>ARG</sup> feat, etc.). Your control is detailed and specific enough to allow you to merge the target&#8217;s clothing and armor with their body and replicate the appearance of other clothes, armor, and even jewelry. Such articles cannot be removed from the creature&#8217;s possession, as they are formed from the target&#8217;s body. As usual, merged armor provides no AC and any merged equipment cannot be accessed. Additionally, the option to alter a target&#8217;s cosmetic appearance with Blank Transformation no longer requires a trait if not assuming the guise of a specific individual.</p>\n<p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>\n<p><strong>Camouflage:</strong> The target may shift its coloration to mimic its environment, granting a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. This does not stack with invisibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Vocal Mimicry:</strong> The target may perfectly imitate voices and sounds with which it is familiar. The target gets a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to vocally imitate a creature type, individual, or object that they have listened to for at least 10 minutes. These 10 minutes do not have to have been during the duration of the shapeshift. This bonus does not stack with the bonus to Disguise checks from shapeshift, but does increase the bonus to Disguise to imitate a specific individual to +15. (Must be able to speak)</p>\n",
