      <p>You can make it harder for a target to concentrate on using their
      magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> Your target must succeed at a
      concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + your casting ability modifier
      + half your caster level for any spell, talent, or similar effect that
      might otherwise be subject to a concentration check under adverse
      conditions (Will negates). You must concentrate to maintain this effect,
      up to a maximum number of rounds equal to half your caster level (minimum
      1) or until the target fails a concentration check, whichever comes
      first.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> As the lesser charm, though you no
      longer need to concentrate to maintain the effect, the duration is equal
      to your caster level (or until the target fails a concentration check,
      whichever comes first), and the concentration DC equals 10 + your casting
      ability modifier + your caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> As the greater charm, though the
      effect persists even if the target fails a concentration check, lasting
      for up to a maximum duration of a number of rounds equal to your caster
      level.</p>
