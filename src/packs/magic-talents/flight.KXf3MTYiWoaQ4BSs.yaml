      <p>When using telekinesis to lift a creature or creatures and spending a
      spell point to create a Sustained Force on them, you may grant that
      creature the ability to control their own movement for the duration of the
      Sustained Force. They gain a fly speed equal to your telekinesis speed,
      with maneuverability (perfect).</p>

      <p>When affecting a target with a Sustained Force, they no longer need to
      remain within your telekinesis range.</p>
