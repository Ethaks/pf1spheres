    value: >
      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a gyroscopic totem.
      Gravitational fluctuations keep enemies within this totem unbalanced while
      they remain within. An unbalanced creature can still move, but entering
      squares draws attacks of opportunity as if they had left the square, and
      the creature can not take 5-foot steps.</p>

      <p>In addition, at the end of any movement with a total distance greater
      than 5 feet, the creature must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. If
      the creature has more than 2 legs, it gains a +1 bonus to this saving
      throw for each additional leg, and creatures that are flying, crawling,
      swimming, or burrowing are unaffected, as are creatures that are not
      affected by gravity such as incorporeal creatures. Teleporting creatures
      do not draw attacks of opportunity because of this totem.</p>
