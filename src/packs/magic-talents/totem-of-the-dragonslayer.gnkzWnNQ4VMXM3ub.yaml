      <p>You and your allies gain a +1 competence bonus to Reflex saves vs. area
      effects. This increases by +1 for every 5 caster levels you possess. When
      you create this totem, you may spend a spell point. If you do, whenever an
      ally attempts a Reflex saving throw that benefits from this totem against
      an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, they take
      no damage on a successful save instead.</p>
