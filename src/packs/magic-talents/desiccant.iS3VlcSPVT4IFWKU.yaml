      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Aridity of
      severity level 3 or higher, whenever they strike an enemy with a natural
      attack, unarmed strike, or touch attack (including as part of another
      touch attack), the target suffers +1d4 nonlethal damage from desiccation.
      This increases by 1 die size for every severity level above 3, to a
      maximum of +1d12 at severity level 7.</p>
