      <p>You can send a piece of your mind into your target to see the world
      through their eyes (save negates). The target gets a new Will save every
      time you use this ability, although consecutive rounds do not give
      additional saves. While this link to your target remains, you can choose
      to use this ability at any time before the link expires, or have its
      activation linked to a specific event that your target may experience. If
      a target fails their saving throw against this ability, they do not
      realize it is being used on them.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> While the link remains active, you can
      use the target&#8217;s senses for 1 round per caster level and see and
      hear what they can. The rounds need not be consecutive. The link remains
      active for up to 1 hour per caster level from the time the target is first
      affected. Abilities that block or suppress possession or remove
      enchantments (such as the protection from evil spell or the Break
      Enchantment talent) will similarly block, suppress, or remove the effect
      of this charm on your target.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> As the lesser charm, but you can use
      their senses for 1 minute per caster level, and the link lasts for 1 day
      per caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> As the greater charm, but you can use
      their senses for 1 hour per caster level, and the link lasts for 1 week
      per caster level.</p>
