      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Distant Teleport, Unseeing
      Teleport), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When teleporting, you may spend 2 spell points to increase the range to
      100 miles per caster level. You must have some clear idea of the location
      and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more
      likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy
      may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p>

      <p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d100 and consult the
      following table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the
      terms on the table.</p>

      <p><strong>Familiarity:</strong> &#8220;Very familiar&#8221; is a place
      where you have been very often and where you feel at home. &#8220;Studied
      carefully&#8221; is a place you know well, either because you can
      currently physically see it or you have been there often. &#8220;Seen
      casually&#8221; is a place that you have seen more than once but with
      which you are not very familiar. &#8220;Viewed once&#8221; is a place that
      you have seen once, possibly using magic such as the Scrying advanced
      talent. &#8220;False destination&#8221; is a place that does not truly
      exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no
      longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be
      familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to
      obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d100, since there is no
      real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target
      from.</p>

      <p><strong>On Target:</strong> You appear where you want to be.</p>

      <p><strong>Off Target:</strong> You appear safely a random distance away
      from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d100 of
      the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is
      determined randomly.</p>

      <p><strong>Similar Area:</strong> You wind up in an area that is visually
      or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the
      closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the
      spell&#8217;s range, the spell simply fails instead.</p>

      <p><strong>Mishap:</strong> You and anyone else teleporting with you have
      gotten &#8220;scrambled.&#8221; You each take 1d10 points of damage, and
      you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll
      1d20+80. Each time &#8220;Mishap&#8221; comes up, the characters take more
      damage and must reroll.</p>
