      <p>When using the Pummel geomancing ability, the tree branches may throw
      vegetation as a ranged attack instead of only making melee slam attacks.
      The attack is treated as a thrown weapon with a range increment equal to
      twice the tree branch&#8217;s reach. The attack roll and damage otherwise
      remain unchanged.</p>
