      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Cindercloud:</strong> You may exude a cloud of smoke and embers
      in a 10-foot radius as a move action. This radius increases by 5 feet at
      5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter. All creatures fully
      within this area gain concealment (attacks against them have a 20% miss
      chance). If creatures within this area attack creatures outside this area,
      the targets also have concealment.</p>

      <p>Any creature other than you that enters or starts its turn inside this
      area takes fire damage equal to your caster level. This damage cannot be
      taken more than once per round by an individual creature. You may end this
      effect as a free action. Doing so removes the cloud at the end of your
      turn but does not end the fey-blessing; you may create and dismiss
      cinderclouds for the duration of the fey-blessing.</p>

      <p><strong>Sense Object:</strong> You may spend a full-round action to
      discern the distance and direction to one object that was within your
      possession for at least 24 hours prior to it leaving your possession
      within the past 1 day per caster level. You may only target a single
      object with each activation of this fey-blessing; selecting another object
      requires spending a spell point and dismisses the previous instance.</p>

      <p><strong>Smokesight:</strong> You can see clearly through ash, fire, and
      smoke (including the cindercloud ability above) as if they were perfectly
      clear, ignoring miss chance from these obstructions, up to the normal
      limits of your vision.</p>
