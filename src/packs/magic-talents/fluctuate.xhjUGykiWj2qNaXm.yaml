    value: >
      <p>By spending a spell point you can charge a target with spatial
      instability. Each turn they may teleport as a swift action, with the range
      decreased to 10 feet plus an additional 5 feet per 4 caster levels. This
      effect lasts as long as you concentrate. As a free action you may spend a
      spell point to allow the effect to continue for 1 round per caster level
      without the need for concentration.</p>

      <p>You cannot select this talent if you possess the Bender drawback, or
      otherwise do not possess the teleport function of the Warp sphere.</p>
