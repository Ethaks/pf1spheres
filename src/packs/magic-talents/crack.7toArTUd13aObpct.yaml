    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to disrupt the ground around you. This is
      an instantaneous effect, and cannot be dispelled once finished. You can
      only affect materials you can create (i.e., you must possess the Expanded
      Materials talent to work with materials other than vegetable matter). You
      cause terrain in a 10-foot radius to suddenly crack and break, making the
      squares difficult terrain. This radius increases by 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels. A square can be cleared as a standard action, which provokes an
      attack of opportunity, or repaired with a spell or effect such as the
      Repair ability of the Creation sphere to no longer be difficult terrain.
      If a square would be made of a mineral (stone, metals, gems, etc.), the
      radius you may affect is reduced by half.</p>

      <p>If you possess Distant Creation, you may center this effect anywhere
      within range.</p>
