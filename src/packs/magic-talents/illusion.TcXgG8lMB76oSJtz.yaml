      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to create an illusion
      within close range. This illusion may be a figment or a glamer, and has a
      duration of concentration, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. By
      default, these illusions are visual only. You cannot move further away
      from the illusion than your illusion range while maintaining it through
      concentration, and the illusion is limited in size according to Table:
      Illusion Maximum Size.</p>
