      <p>When you take this talent, choose 2 skills that you have ranks in. When
      it is summoned, your companion can apply your total skill ranks and class
      skill bonuses in place of its own when attempting these skill checks. This
      cannot grant the companion more ranks in a skill than its number of Hit
