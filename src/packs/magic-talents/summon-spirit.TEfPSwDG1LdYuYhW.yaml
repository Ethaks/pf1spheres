      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 3 spell points and 1 hour to summon the spirit of a dead
      creature. You must know the exact creature you are trying to summon and be
      able to designate them (such as their name or place and time of death,
      etc.) and the more familiar you are with the spirit and the more recently
      they died, the more likely they are to appear. The spirit you are trying
      to summon is allowed a Will save with the following modifiers depending on
      your knowledge and connection to the target, as well as its time of
      death:</p>

      <p>On a successful saving throw, the target does not appear and may choose
      to retaliate spiritually, giving you 2 temporary negative levels that last
      24 hours (meaning you must save against them becoming permanent). While
      friends may choose to purposefully fail their saving throw and come
      willingly, in most other cases being ripped from the afterlife is a horrid
      experience and can turn even the nicest of spirits hostile. If a spirit
      succeeds at their saving throw against this effect they cannot be summoned
      again by the same caster for 1 month. Sometimes, the spirits of heroes,
      kings, and others are protected by a deity and are simply unable to be
      summoned.</p>

      <p>Once a spirit has been summoned, you may do any of the following:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You may ask one question per two caster levels. The corpse&#8217;s
      knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages
      it spoke. Answers may be brief, cryptic, or repetitive. A creature who
      would have opposed you in life may attempt a new Will save to refuse to
      answer or to lie with the Bluff skill.</li>

      <li>You may use the spirit as a component when creating an animated object
      or undead creature (Will negates if unwilling; if the spirit succeeds at
      its save, it immediately returns to the afterlife as if it had made its
      original saving throw). You must create the undead creature or animated
      object as usual, but by placing the spirit into the target, the spirit is
      brought back to life within this new body. The object or undead creature
      gains the mental attributes, personality, memories, etc. of the selected
      spirit, but otherwise is normal for its new creature type. (At the
      GM&#8217;s discretion, a spirit bound to a permanent animated object or
      undead creature may recover or gain class levels over time, but loses at
      least 1 level per CR of its new form.) An undead creature or animated
      object created in this way is not automatically under your control.</li>

      <li>If you possess the Resurrection advanced Life talent, you may place
      the spirit into a new body, bringing the soul back to life, even if you do
      not have the target&#8217;s body, it is missing vital components, or the
      target has been dead for longer than the time limit. You must possess
      either a soulless body (such as one created through the Fleshcraft and
      Create Materials advanced Creation talents), or else a body assembled from
      other, recently slain bodies. (Assembly requires either the target&#8217;s
      body with one additional body for every replaced vital component, or else
      a minimum of six different bodies&#8212;one for each limb, the torso
      including head, and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be
      necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required.)
      You may bring the target back to life with the Resurrection advanced Life
      talent. The target retains its ability scores and class levels (even those
      dependent on blood, such as sorcerer levels) but its race and appearance
      depend on the body possessed.</li>
