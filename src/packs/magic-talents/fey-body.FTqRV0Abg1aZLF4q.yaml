      <p>You may apply the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Fey Skin:</strong> The target gains DR 3/cold iron. This
      improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Wild Empathy:</strong> The target may improve the initial
      attitude of an animal within 30 feet using Diplomacy. The target gains a
      bonus equal to half your caster level on this check. Typically domestic
      animals start as indifferent and wild animals start as unfriendly and the
      check takes 1 minute. This ability may be used to influence a magical
      beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but the check takes a -4
      penalty. If you spend an additional spell point when granting this trait,
      this check may be performed as a standard action and the penalty for
      influencing magical beasts is removed.</p>

      <p><strong>Woodland Stride:</strong> The target may move through any sort
      of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and
      similar terrain) at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering
      impairment. This has no effect on magically manipulated terrain.</p>
