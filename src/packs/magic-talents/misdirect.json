      "value": "<p>You imbue an area to persuade travelers to wander elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesser Cloud:</strong> A creature entering the cloud must succeed on a Will save. Failure causes them to, potentially, change directions. Roll a d8 as if throwing a splash weapon that missed its target square; on a 1, the creature continues moving in its intended direction. On a 2 through 8, count around the target creature&#8217;s adjacent squares in a clockwise direction to determine the direction it walks in. It finishes moving after the intended distance has been traversed, or after it moves into an obstruction (such as a wall). If it was moving faster than its typical movement speed (such as by running) the creature takes 1d4 nonlethal damage. This cloud lasts for one minute per caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Cloud:</strong> As the lesser cloud, but you determine the new direction of travel when imbuing the area with the cloud and may select a number of familiar creatures equal to your casting ability modifier to be immune to the cloud&#8217;s effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Cloud:</strong> As the greater cloud, but you may alter the direction of every target moving through the cloud as a free action as long as you remain within close range of the cloud</p>\n",
