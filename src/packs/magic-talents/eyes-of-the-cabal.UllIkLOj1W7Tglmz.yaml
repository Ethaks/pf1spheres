      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere (Prying Sight
      (sense)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>The duration of the Prying Sight talent increases from 1 hour per
      caster level to 1 day per caster level and you may concentrate on a target
      under the effects of prying sight no matter how far away they are, as long
      as they are on the same plane as you.</p>

      <p>While concentrating as a move action on a target under the effects of
      prying sight, you may target another creature within close range of the
      target as a free action and transfer this sphere effect to the creature,
      treating that creature as the new target of this effect. The duration of
      this effect is shared between targets, and successfully transferring this
      effect to a new target ends this effect on the previous target. An
      unwilling target may attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect,
      and a creature who succeeds at their saving throw cannot be targeted in
      this way again for 24 hours. Unlike other sphere effects, an unwilling
      target is not made aware when they succeed at a saving throw against this
      effect.</p>

      <p>If you spend two additional spell points when casting prying sight, you
      no longer transfer the effects of prying sight to a new target, and
      instead copy the effect onto the new target, treating both targets as
      being under the effects of the same prying sight. There is no limit to the
      number of creatures you may copy the effects of prying sight onto, but the
      duration of the effect is still shared between targets, and ends for all
      affected targets when the effect&#8217;s duration expires. However,
      copying prying sight onto new targets treats each copy as a separate
      sphere effect. If a copy of prying sight ends early or is dispelled for
      one target, it does not end for all affected targets.</p>
