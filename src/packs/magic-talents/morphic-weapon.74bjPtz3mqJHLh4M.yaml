      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Amorphous Weaponry:</strong> The target gains the ability to
      morph and shift their natural attacks. As a free action, the target can
      change the damage types of any number of their natural weapons to include
      any combination of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing (e.g. spikes for
      piercing and/or sharp edges for slashing on a slam attack). At 5th caster
      level, the target may instead spend a swift action to add one weapon
      feature to one of their natural weapons, chosen from the brace, deadly,
      disarm, distracting, nonlethal, reach, sunder, or trip weapon features.
      The target may only apply one weapon feature to each natural attack they
      possess, and applying another weapon feature to a natural attack the
      target already modified overwrites the previous weapon feature.
      [SA:EAO]</p>

      <p><strong>Graft Weapon:</strong> Choose one limb capable of wielding a
      weapon that is holding a weapon that can be used in one hand. You may
      graft the weapon held by this limb into the limb itself. A grafted weapon
      cannot be disarmed and may be treated as a primary natural attack. The
      target loses other uses of this limb and may take skill check penalties as
      a result. A grafted weapon may be damaged and sundered as normal.</p>

      <p><strong>Shape Weapon:</strong> Choose one limb capable of wielding a
      weapon. You may transform this limb into a weapon the target creature is
      proficient with. This weapon cannot be disarmed and gains an enhancement
      bonus equal to 1/4 of your caster level (minimum 0, maximum +5). Ranged
      weapons produced this way do not come with ammunition. A two-handed weapon
      still requires an additional limb to wield. This weapon is treated as a
      manufactured weapon with hardness equal to your caster level. Treat the
      weapon as having its own hit points, normal for a weapon of its type, for
      purposes of effects that would damage or sunder it. If this weapon has the
      broken condition when the shapeshift ends, any attacks or skill checks
      made with the corresponding limb take a -2 penalty to attack rolls for 24
      hours. A DC 15 Heal check or magical healing equal to the hit points the
      weapon possessed remove this penalty.</p>
