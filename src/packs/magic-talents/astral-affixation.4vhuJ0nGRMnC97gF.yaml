      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere (Affix (advanced),
      Effortless Telekinesis (advanced), Idle Concentration), caster level
      15th.</p>

      <p>When you affix a target permanently in place, you may spend an
      additional spell point to strengthen the effect by pinning them to astral
      leylines. A creature that has failed its Reflex save against being affixed
      must succeed at a third save or be rendered paralyzed for as long as they
      are affixed.</p>

      <p>In addition, regardless of whether or not this additional save is
      failed, breaking a target free that has been affixed in this way requires
      a successful magic skill check or Strength check against your MSD + 10. In
      addition, a telekinesis effect or the Freedom word with a lower caster
      level than the affixing will always be insufficient and cannot break a
      target free.</p>
