      <p>As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in
      conjunction with using either a blood art or blood control. If a creature
      is struck by this attack, it is either affected by the blood art or you
      may initiate blood control on that creature (including a (quicken) or
      (still) effect) if it is not under the effects of your blood control. If
      you chose blood control and it is under the effects of your blood control,
      you may apply a new (quicken) or (still) effect to the blood control
      effect. Applying any (quicken) ability as part of this talent counts as
      dealing bleed damage with the weapon for the purposes of the Bloodmonger
      feat. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard action, and does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if making a ranged
      attack.</p>
