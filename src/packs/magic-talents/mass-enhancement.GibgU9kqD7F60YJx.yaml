    value: >
      <p>When bestowing an enhancement, you may spend an additional spell point
      to enhance an additional 1 target per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) at the
      same time. Each target must be within range and must gain the same
      enhancement (thus, if using the Physical Enhancement talent to increase a
      target&#8217;s Strength, you could only target creatures, all of which
      would gain increased Strength). Once created, each enhancement is
      considered a separate sphere effect.</p>
