      <p>You gain a breath weapon as a supernatural ability when you gain this
      talent. This breath weapon is either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone,
      chosen the first time this talent is gained. This talent may be taken
      twice to gain both options. This breath weapon deals 1d8 damage per 2
      caster levels (minimum 1d8), and allows a Reflex save for half damage.
      Using this breath weapon is a standard action, but you must wait at least
      1d4 rounds between uses.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use this breath weapon, you may choose a damage type from
      among those available to you based on your packages, as outlined
      below:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Air:</strong> sonic damage</li>

      <li><strong>Earth:</strong> bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage</li>

      <li><strong>Fire:</strong> fire damage</li>

      <li><strong>Metal:</strong> electricity damage</li>

      <li><strong>Plant:</strong> acid damage</li>

      <li><strong>Water:</strong> cold damage</li>
