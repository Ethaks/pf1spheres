    value: >
      <p>Whenever a creature misses with a melee or melee touch attack against
      you, you may spend a spell point as an immediate action to affect that
      creature with a destructive blast. This does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity, and cannot be combined with Gather Energy or spending a spell
      point to increase its damage. The creature may attempt a Reflex save to
      negate the damage. You must be aware of the attack and able to act.</p>
