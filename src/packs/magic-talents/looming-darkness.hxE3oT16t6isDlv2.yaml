      <p>You may create a darkness or blot effect that erodes the resolve of
      those who enter it. Creatures within this area of darkness or blot must
      succeed at a Will save or suffer a -1 penalty to all saving throws so long
      as they remain within this area of darkness. This penalty increases by 1
      per 5 caster levels. If any creature enters this area of darkness or blot,
      they must immediately save or suffer this penalty. This is a
      mind-affecting effect.</p>
