      <p>Increase the maximum radius of your Bury and Tremor by an additional 5
      feet per 5 caster levels. Additionally, you gain the following geomancing
      abilities:</p>

      <p><strong>Unearth:</strong> Concentration, requires dirt or stone. You
      may manipulate the earth surrounding a burrowing or buried creature or
      object, forcing them to be pushed or pulled 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels each round towards the surface (Fortitude negates). While affected,
      the target is unable to burrow or earth glide on its own, but is otherwise
      unimpeded. You may only target a creature or object whose location you
      have pinpointed (such as with a successful Perception check or with
      tremorsense). Unless the target has earth glide, the creature cannot be
      forcefully moved through stone (or lava if the target possesses fire
      resistance 20+ or fire immunity), but rather only sand or dirt. Each
      round, the target is allowed a new Fortitude save to end the effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Sandstone:</strong> Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point
      to transform dirt or sand into stone in an area within range. The size of
      the created rock or stone depends both on your caster level and the radius
      of dirt or sand you target. Alternatively, you may encase a dirt or sand
      covered target in 1 inch thick stone. Refer to Table: Sandstone to
      determine the maximum target size to be encased. For every size smaller
      the encased target is than the required radius of dirt or sand, either
      double the thickness of the stone or increase the number of encased
      targets. Creatures and objects are allowed a Reflex save to avoid being
      trapped in stone. On a failure, creatures or objects caught in the area
      are encased; to escape, they must succeed at an Escape Artist or Strength
      check (equal to your Bury geomancing DC) as a full-round action;
      alternatively, a creature may break free by dealing sufficient damage to
      the rock or stone.</p>

      <p>Stone has a hardness of 15 and 2 hit points per inch. On a successful
      save, affected targets are still entangled and immobilized until they
      escape or 1 minute per caster level, whichever comes first.</p>
