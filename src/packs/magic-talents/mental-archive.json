      "value": "<p>You construct a magical mental system to perfectly memorize information. By concentrating as long it requires to perceive something (such as the duration of a speech or while reading a book), you can archive it. Once a memory is archived you can concentrate to remember it. This can allow you to notice new details by attempting Perception checks. This does not allow you to use senses or similar abilities that you did not use or possess at the time of memorization (such as a Divination sphere effect, or blindsight).</p>\n<p>You can archive a number of memories equal to your casting ability modifier + 1 per 2 caster levels. A single memory can be up to one book (roughly 400 pages or 100,000 words), one hour of sound, or one minute of full sensory experience. Larger works can be archived by using multiple memories. You may memorize the content of magical texts and similar information, but cannot use their magical properties from memory (such as casting from scrolls, scribing spells, or preparing spells from a spellbook). You may unarchive memories as a free action, losing your ability to perfectly recall them. You may permanently archive a memory by spending a spell point; over the next 24 hours, you engrave it perfectly into your memory. You cannot replenish the spent spell point until the 24 hours are complete. At the end of this time, the memory no longer counts against your archived memories.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracking Memories:</strong> Mental Archive allows characters to store and replace memories, which can require keeping track of. It is recommended that players keep a clear list of what they have temporarily and permanently memorized.</p>\n",
