      <p>Your companion gains one of the abilities listed below. This talent may
      be taken more than once; each time a different ability may be gained:</p>

      <p><strong>Nauseating Spray:</strong> As a standard action your companion
      may spray noxious chemicals in a 15-foot cone. Any creature in this cone
      must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice +
      Constitution modifier or be sickened for 1d6 rounds. This is a poison
      effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Stench:</strong> Your companion secretes a stinking chemical
      offensive to most living things. Any creature other than you adjacent to
      your companion must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened until 1d6
      rounds after they are no longer adjacent. A creature that saves against
      this effect is immune to any instance of it from the same companion for 24
      hours. This is a poison effect.</p>
