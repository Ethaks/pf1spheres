      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Pure Darkness (darkness)),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Pure Darkness no longer counts against the number of (darkness) talents
      you may apply to an area of darkness.</p>

      <p>In addition, when you apply the effects of Pure Darkness to your
      darkness, you may spend an additional spell point to make an even deeper
      area of shadow. All areas of light, even bright light, become absolute
      darkness, and no mundane light sources function. Darkvision or even see in
      darkness does not function in this area, and all other senses (such as
      blindsight or scent) are reduced to a 5 feet range.</p>
