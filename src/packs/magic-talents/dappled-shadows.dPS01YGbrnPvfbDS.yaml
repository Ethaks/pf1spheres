      <p>You may reduce the radius of your darkness or blot in 5 feet increments
      to create a second area of darkness or blot with a radius equal to the
      subtracted amount. You may do this multiple times to create multiple areas
      of darkness or blot. These spheres may be placed anywhere within your
      range that you can see, but do not overlap each other. If used in
      conjunction with the Wall Of Darkness talent, your cubes no longer need to
      be placed contiguously.</p>
