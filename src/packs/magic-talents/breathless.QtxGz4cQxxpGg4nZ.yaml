    value: >
      <p>You may create an aegis that suspends the body&#8217;s needs. The
      target gains a +4 morale bonus to saving throws against poisons and
      diseases, can withstand extreme pressures (such as from the ocean), and
      can survive without air, making it immune to effects that require
      breathing (such as inhaled poison), and granting it the power to survive
      underwater, or even in a vacuum. This does not give immunity to cloud or
      gas attacks that do not require breathing.</p>
