      <p>You may enhance creatures, granting them alignment subtypes
      corresponding to the non-neutral components of their alignment. While
      under the effects of this enhancement, that creature gains damage
      reduction equal to 1/3 of your caster level (minimum 1), bypassed by
      attacks made with weapons aligned to the alignment opposed to their new
      subtype. This damage reduction stacks with any other source of damage
      reduction they might have.</p>
