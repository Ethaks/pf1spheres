      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere, caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>Each time you use a ghost strike that does not cause negative levels or
      immediately kill its target (such as Killing Curse), you can choose for it
      not to count as a death effect, meaning it can affect creatures normally
      resistant or immune to death effects, such as outsiders with the daemon
      subtype. This allows you to affect constructs and undead with your ghost
      strikes. Such creatures gain a +4 bonus to any granted saving throw, and
      may still be immune to the effects caused by your ghost strike (disease,
      etc.).</p>
