      "value": "<p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>\n<p><strong>Amorphous Weaponry:</strong> The target gains the ability to morph and shift their natural attacks. As a free action, the target can change the damage types of any number of their natural weapons to include any combination of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing (e.g. spikes for piercing and/or sharp edges for slashing on a slam attack). At 5th caster level, the target may instead spend a swift action to add one weapon feature to one of their natural weapons, chosen from the brace, deadly, disarm, distracting, nonlethal, reach, sunder, or trip weapon features. The target may only apply one weapon feature to each natural attack they possess, and applying another weapon feature to a natural attack the target already modified overwrites the previous weapon feature. [SA:EAO]</p>\n<p><strong>Graft Weapon:</strong> Choose one limb capable of wielding a weapon that is holding a weapon that can be used in one hand. You may graft the weapon held by this limb into the limb itself. A grafted weapon cannot be disarmed and may be treated as a primary natural attack. The target loses other uses of this limb and may take skill check penalties as a result. A grafted weapon may be damaged and sundered as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Shape Weapon:</strong> Choose one limb capable of wielding a weapon. You may transform this limb into a weapon the target creature is proficient with. This weapon cannot be disarmed and gains an enhancement bonus equal to 1/4 of your caster level (minimum 0, maximum +5). Ranged weapons produced this way do not come with ammunition. A two-handed weapon still requires an additional limb to wield. This weapon is treated as a manufactured weapon with hardness equal to your caster level. Treat the weapon as having its own hit points, normal for a weapon of its type, for purposes of effects that would damage or sunder it. If this weapon has the broken condition when the shapeshift ends, any attacks or skill checks made with the corresponding limb take a -2 penalty to attack rolls for 24 hours. A DC 15 Heal check or magical healing equal to the hit points the weapon possessed remove this penalty.</p>\n",
