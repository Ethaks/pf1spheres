      "value": "<p>You gain several abilities which improve your capacity to operate underwater.</p>\n<p><strong>Adjust Buoyancy (spirit):</strong> You may spend 1 spell point to change your buoyancy to swiftly rising, neutral, or swiftly sinking for 10 minutes per level (see the aquatic rules section of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures for rules on buoyancy). Your buoyancy does not change based on what equipment you are carrying. As a standard action, you may change your buoyancy again (alongside the buoyancy of any other willing creatures affected by this spirit).</p>\n<p><strong>Aquatic Mire (geomancing):</strong> You may create fog effects underwater, in which case they function as they normally would in the air. Instead of wind, currents can disperse an underwater fog; any current with a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a fog in 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Create Current (geomancing):</strong> If you have the (air) package, you may use the gust of wind ability underwater, creating a current of equal speed and range to the gust of wind you could create (see the aquatic rules section of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures for rules on currents).</p>\n<p><strong>Deep Adaptation (spirit):</strong> You adapt incredibly quickly to changes in pressure, taking no damage from pressure effects. In addition, you can move and attack underwater normally without the usual penalties involved with underwater combat, as if under the effects of freedom of movement (this does not grant you the other benefits of the spell). This benefit lasts for as long as you concentrate or 10 minutes per caster level if you spend 1 spell point.</p>\n<p><strong>Echoes of the Sea (spirit):</strong> You may spend 1 spell point to gain the ability to track creatures through the water as if across soft ground as long as they passed through the area less than 1 week ago (this lets you notice trails that are much older than normal underwater trails). You retain this benefit for 1 hour per caster level.</p>\n",
