      <p>When you create a barrier, you may spend a spell point or increase the
      casting time by one step (usually from a standard to a full-round action)
      to allow the barrier to react to damage.</p>

      <p>Upon creating a reactive barrier, you may choose one of the following
      effects to activate whenever the barrier would be reduced to 0 hit points.
      If you maintain your barrier through concentration, you may change the
      effect as part of the action used to concentrate:</p>

      <p><strong>Forceful Rebuke:</strong> You may attempt a bull-rush attempt
      against all enemies within 5 feet of your barrier, using your caster level
      + your casting ability modifier in place of your CMB. If this attempt
      would exceed a creature&#8217;s CMD by 5 or more, the creature must
      succeed a Reflex saving throw or immediately fall prone.</p>

      <p><strong>Explosive Burst:</strong> All enemies within 5 feet of your
      barrier suffer 1d6 points of force damage, plus an additional 1d6 damage
      per 5 caster levels you possess (Reflex halves).</p>

      <p><strong>Fortifying Surge:</strong> All allies within 10 feet of your
      barrier gain DR/- equal to half your caster level for 1 round.</p>
