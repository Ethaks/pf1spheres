      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Unwilling Teleport),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>When you use Unwilling Teleport, you may cause unwilling targets to be
      teleported into locations which are not in open areas or on solid
      surfaces. Targets of such effects receive a +4 bonus to their saving
      throws to resist such effects. Creatures teleported into the air fall if
      they lack some means to fly, taking falling damage as normal. Creatures
      teleported into occupied areas are shunted out, taking damage as
      normal.</p>
