      <p>Whenever an ally hits an enemy with an attack, they may spend a point
      of momentum as an immediate action to try and demoralize that enemy with
      their Intimidate skill. If the enemy is already shaken, they may instead
      spend three points to attempt to make the shaken enemy frightened. If they
      are already frightened, they may instead spend five points to attempt to
      make the frightened enemy panicked.</p>
