      <p>You may create a darkness or blot effect that erodes the mental
      capacity of those inside. Any creature inside the darkness must succeed at
      a Fortitude save or suffer 1 point of Wisdom damage, +1 per 10 caster
      levels. Creatures who remain within this area of darkness must save at the
      end of your subsequent turns or suffer another point of Wisdom damage.</p>

      <p>If a creature enters this area of darkness or blot after it is created,
      they must immediately save or also suffer this damage. A creature may only
      be affected by Intoxicating Darkness once per round, regardless of how
      many times they enter or exit the area that turn.</p>
