      "value": "<p>You may spend a spell point and attempt a magic skill check against your target. If successful, you burn a number of spell points from the target&#8217;s spell pool, removing it from their spell pool as if they had used the spell point themselves (although this does not trigger effects that rely on spell points being spent, such as drawbacks from the target&#8217;s casting tradition, or the triggering of wild magic). The amount of spell points burned starts 1d3 and increases at 5th level and every four caster levels thereafter (up to a maximum of 3d6 at 25th caster level), as listed under Table: Burn Dice.</p>\n<strong>Table: Burn Dice</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caster Level</th>\n<th>Burn Size</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>2d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21st</td>\n<td>3d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25th</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The expunge ability is created with the intention of being used upon other spellcasters that utilize the Spheres of Power system of magic, but can be made to work with other systems of magic as well. When used against a spellcaster that utilizes the core system of magic in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, a GM may allow it to burn spell slots or spells prepared. To calculate which spells are affected, total the number of spell points burned. The caster suffering from the Spellburn talent may then choose an amount of spell slots or prepared spells to lose. They must choose an amount of spells that amount to the points cost, following this list to determine the value of each spell level in spell points:</p>\n<p><strong>Level 1-2:</strong> 1 spell point, <strong>Level 3-5:</strong> 2 spell points, <strong>Level 6-8:</strong> 3 spell points, <strong>Level 9:</strong> 4 spell points.</p>\n<p>If there is an amount of spell points remaining that the spellcaster cannot sacrifice spells of a level to make up for without going above the amount (for example, only losing 1 spell point but not having any 1st or 2nd level spell slots/prepared spells left), they may ignore the remainder without sacrificing additional spell slots. When used on creatures with psionic manifesting (Psionics Unleashed by Dreamscarred Press), the creature loses a number of power points equal to the number of spell points that would have been lost multiplied by 1 + its Hit Dice/4.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc2\"><span>Manipulation</span></h2>\n<p>You learn to bend the rules of magic to your advantage.
