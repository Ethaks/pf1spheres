      <p>(Vitality) talents are benefits a caster may grant to any ally at the
      same time they use any other Life sphere ability on them. (Vitality)
      talents always have a duration of up to 1 minute starting at the time the
      effect was used, or until the target takes damage from either failing a
      saving throw or being hit with an attack roll.</p>

      <p>If a caster possesses multiple (vitality) talents, they may only grant
      one to the target of their Life sphere effect, but may choose to grant
      different benefits to each target of a particular Life sphere ability.</p>

      <p>A creature can benefit from a (vitality) talent attached to a Life
      ability, even if they do not actually gain anything from the Life ability
      (such as using cure on a creature at full hit points).</p>
