      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (any two (blast
      type) talents in the crystal blast type group including either Crystal
      Blast or Living Crystal Blast), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When using the Crystal Blast or Living Crystal Blast talent, you may
      spend an extra spell point to fully encase your targets in a shell of
      crystal. Targets that fail their Reflex saves against your destructive
      blast are helpless and cannot take physical actions other than to attempt
      Strength or Escape Artist checks to escape the crystal, but can still
      breathe and take purely mental actions. The crystal blocks line of sight
      and line of effect to and from the encased target. Destroying the cocoon
      frees the victim, the crystal having hit points as normal for the Crystal
      Blast and Living Crystal Blast talent.</p>
