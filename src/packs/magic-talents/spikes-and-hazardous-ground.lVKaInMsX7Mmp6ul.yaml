    value: >
      <p>You may create spikes on an object or the ground that deal damage to
      targets who run into or pass over them. If a target is pushed onto spikes
      (such as through a successful bull rush) or steps onto them, make a touch
      attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack
      bonus. If successful, the target suffers piercing damage equal to your
      caster level (minimum 1) and has its land speed reduced by half if the
      wound was administered to its feet. This movement penalty lasts for 24
      hours or until the creature is treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives
      at least 1 point of fast healing/magical healing/regeneration. A charging
      or running creature must immediately stop if it enters an area covered in
      spikes. A creature may move at half speed through this area without
      risking damage to itself. Spikes added to a dropped object do not increase
      the damage of the falling object, though spikes added to a wall count as
      increasing its size as mentioned above.</p>

      <p>When placing spikes or any other form of hazardous terrain directly
      underneath a target, they are allowed a Reflex saving throw. Success means
      they suffer no effect from the hazardous terrain in that square until the
      end of their next turn. Attempting to move into or through such hazardous
      squares affects the target normally. It is also possible, through certain
      talents, to create other forms of hazardous terrain, such as grease, ice,
      acid, or other materials. Hazardous terrain created in this fashion
      functions as normal for its kind.</p>
