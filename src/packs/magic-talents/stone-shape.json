      "value": "<p>You gain a competence bonus on Craft checks equal to your caster level for items primarily composed of stone and may craft such objects as if you had the appropriate tools.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to turn an adequately sized piece of stone into 50 pieces of ammunition, a suit of armor, a shield, a tool, or a weapon normally primarily composed of wood or metal. Objects created this way have twice their normal weight and weapons gain the fragile quality; this quality is retained even when gaining an enhancement bonus. You must succeed on the appropriate Craft check to make the chosen item as part of this action or else the item gains the broken condition, though you may attempt to shape it again. The item is considered masterwork and, if a weapon or suit of armor, gains an enhancement bonus equal to your caster level/5 (minimum 0).</p>\n<p>Equipment made this way returns to its original form when your fey-link ends. Using special types of stone imparts the properties of that stone to the shaped object. If using stone taken from a larger piece of stone, the larger stone takes damage equal to the hit points of the item (before enhancement), ignoring hardness and dealing full damage to objects, which can be restored by putting the item back in place and dismissing the effect as a standard action.</p>\n<p>You can spend a spell point as a standard action to restore 1d6 + caster level hit points to an object made primarily of stone or to a construct composed of stone (such as a stone golem).</p>\n",
