      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere, caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>As an instantaneous effect, you may as a standard action spend a spell
      point to send a message or sound through an element corresponding to a
      package you possess (air, earth, water, etc.) to a designated spot
      anywhere in the world. The message travels to the destination, provided
      that the location is familiar to you and that it can find a way to the
      location through its chosen medium. The message can travel as slowly as 1
      mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes, though if it cannot
      reach its destination within 1 hour per caster level, the effect ends
      without delivering the message. If choosing plant or fire the message can
      travel without a medium, provided the end location possesses either
      plantlife or a fire for the message to be delivered through.</p>

      <p>The message is gentle and unnoticed until it reaches the location,
      where it then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound to all
      creatures within 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels of the destination.
      Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present
      to hear it.</p>

      <p>At time of casting, you can prepare the effect to bear a message of no
      more than 20 + your caster level words, cause the talent to deliver other
      sounds for 1 round per 2 caster levels, or merely have the message seem to
      be a faint manifestation of the chosen element.</p>

      <p>The message cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or
      activate magical effects.</p>
