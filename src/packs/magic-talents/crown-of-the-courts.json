      "value": "<p>You conjure and don a crown representing a chosen court, usually seelie or unseelie (though others may be available depending on setting), gaining an aura of authority over the fey.</p>\n<p>The fey-blessing gains the descriptor matching the chosen court. The crown is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. If the crown is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends immediately. If the crown is not in your possession at the end of your turn, you lose the benefits of this fey-blessing until it returns to your possession. You can summon it to yourself as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You may only have one crown active at a time; activating this ability again automatically ends any previous instances.</p>\n<p>Creatures of the fey type that are associated with the chosen court (good and neutral for seelie, evil for unseelie) are incapable of taking hostile action against you without succeeding on a Will save; if successful, they may act as normal and do not need to save again against your use of this effect for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>On a failure they are incapable of knowingly taking hostile action against you (targeting with an attack or combat maneuver, casting a non-harmless sphere effect, spell, or spell-like or supernatural ability that includes you as a target or within its area of effect, or aiding or granting flanking bonuses to creatures taking hostile action against you) for 1 minute. If you take hostile action against a creature that has failed its save, it is treated as having succeeded on its save. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>\n<p>Creatures of the fey type not associated with the chosen court are shaken whenever they are within 30 feet of you. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>\n",
