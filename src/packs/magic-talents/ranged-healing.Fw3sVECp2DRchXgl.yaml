      <p>Your cure, invigorate, and restore abilities have a range of close
      rather than touch.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Life sphere abilities used at range no
      longer require a successful touch attack, unless otherwise specified (such
      as making an attack with your cure ability; hostile uses of abilities with
      attacks still need to make those attacks).</p>
