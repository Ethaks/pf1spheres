      <p>You gain the following abilities which manipulate the density of the
      target&#8217;s blood:</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) ability, the target&#8217;s blood becomes lighter. The
      target gains a circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to 2 + 1/2
      your caster level for the duration of your blood control. If you spend an
      additional spell point, the target also gains compression as per the
      universal monster rule for the duration of your blood control.</p>

      <p>As a (still) ability, the target&#8217;s blood becomes dense. The
      target gains DR/slashing equal to 1/3 your caster level (minimum 1) for
      the duration of your blood control. If you spend an additional spell
      point, the target instead gains DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 your caster
      level (minimum 1) for this duration. Once the DR/adamantine has prevented
      damage to the target equal to 10 times your caster level, the
      DR/adamantine ends immediately and the target gains DR/slashing equal to
      1/3 your caster level (minimum 1) for the remainder of this effect&#8217;s
      duration.</p>
