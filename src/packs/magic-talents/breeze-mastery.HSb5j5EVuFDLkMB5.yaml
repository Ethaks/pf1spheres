      <p>When using Breeze, you may spend a spell point to have it affect an
      area, granting its benefits to all creatures within a 15-foot radius + 5
      feet per 5 caster levels. Additionally, when you use Breeze, you may add
      any of the following additional effects depending on what other packages
      you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Stable Winds:</strong> Requires air. You can create
      incredibly powerful winds, allowing you to walk upon the air with some
      difficulty as long as you concentrate. You can spend a spell point to
      allow yourself to walk on air as if walking on solid ground, with moving
      upward being similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward
      angle possible is 45 degrees, which is at a rate equal to half your normal
      land speed.</p>

      <p>Wind of severity level 3 or higher can blow you away regardless of your
      size, with any checks required (such as a Strength or Fly check) using
      your casting ability modifier instead of the normal ability modifier used
      for the check. You begin to fall as normal if you stop concentrating on
      this effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Stabilizing Dustveil:</strong> Requires sand or loose
      dirt. You can create winds made up of fine particles of dust and sand,
      stabilizing the area around you. The circumstance bonus granted by Breeze
      also applies to your CMD against bull rush, reposition, trip, and overrun
      combat maneuvers made against you. Additionally, you treat the first
      square of difficult terrain you enter every round as if it were normal
      terrain.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire: Warm Breeze:</strong> Your breeze is heated to ward
      against the chill. Instead of the normal bonus to saves against very hot
      conditions or severe heat, Breeze instead grants this bonus to saves
      against very cold conditions and severe cold. Additionally, when used in
      this way, creatures affected by your Breeze treat the severity of all cold
      and precipitation weather effects as one step less severe, plus one per 10
      caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal: Ferrous Zephyr:</strong> Requires metal. You can create
      a breeze filled with fine filaments of metal. The circumstance bonus
      granted by Breeze also applies to your AC and to saving throws against
      electricity-based effects. Additionally, you ignore the penalties
      associated with the broken condition with any of your worn or wielded
      equipment (but is still considered broken regardless) as long as the
      Breeze is active.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Fragrant Flurry:</strong> Requires grass, vines, or
      weeds. Your breeze smells of pleasant meadows and flowers, and causes
      vines and flowers to grow where it touches. The circumstance bonus granted
      by Breeze also applies to saving throws against the nauseated and sickened
      conditions and any harmful effects that rely on smell. Additionally, the
      DC required to track creatures affected by Breeze increases by an amount
      equal to the circumstance bonus granted by Breeze.</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Cooling Breeze:</strong> Requires rain, mist, or at
      least 5 cubic feet of water. Creatures affected by your Breeze treat the
      severity of all aridity and heat weather effects as one step less severe,
      plus one per 10 caster levels you possess.</p>
