      <p>Whenever you rest for 8 hours, you may spend a spell point to channel a
      bear spirit for the entire rest. Doing so heals you completely in addition
      to regaining your spell points. All non-magical poisons and diseases are
      also cured, and you may make an magical skill check to end any curse
      effect you might be suffering from.</p>
