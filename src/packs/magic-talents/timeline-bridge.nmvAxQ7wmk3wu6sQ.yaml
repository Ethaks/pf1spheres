      <p>By connecting the target to versions of themselves that exist in
      alternate timelines, you grant the target an insight bonus on all
      Knowledge checks equal to 1/2 your caster level and the ability to attempt
      such checks untrained. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but
      may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster
      level without concentration.</p>

      <p>As an immediate action, you may spend a spell point to end this effect
      on the target and apply the insight bonus to their AC against a single
      attack or to a single saving throw by giving them a surge of revelation
      from a version of themselves that has already survived the attack or
      effect in another timeline.</p>
