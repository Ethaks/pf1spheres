      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere (any one (motif), any one
      (arcana)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Your ability to glimpse and actualize your target&#8217;s fate
      heightens. (Arcana) talents attached to a motif grant bonuses as though
      they were granted as a motif. A target cannot benefit from an
      (arcana)&#8217;s bonuses more than once, and they do not stack (wands
      attached to two different motifs do not grant separate bonuses to
      initiative).</p>

      <p>In addition, when you cast a motif and attach an (arcana), you may
      spend an additional spell point to attach up to three (arcana) to that
      motif, instead of just one. When a motif with multiple attached (arcana)
      is discharged, each (arcana) talent&#8217;s discharge effects occur
      simultaneously.</p>

      <p>If the same (arcana) is attached to one motif multiple times, that
      (arcana)&#8217;s bonuses do not stack and the discharge&#8217;s duration
      and effects resolve cumulatively.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A sphere caster with a Fate sphere caster
      level of 10 grants the target a motif with 3 attached wands. The target
      would gain +3 initiative as normal for the Wands talent when granted as a
      motif and no additional benefit for the two additional wands. A target who
      discharges an attached motif with three attached swords would ignore
      concealment for three minutes and receive three separate critical
      confirmation bonuses after the motif is discharged.</p>
