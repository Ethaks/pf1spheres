    value: >
      <p>You may create a darkness or blot effect that subtly anesthetizes those
      inside. Any creature inside the darkness must succeed at a Fortitude save
      or suffer 1 point of Dexterity damage, +1 per 10 caster levels. Creatures
      who remain within this area of darkness must save at the end of your
      subsequent turns or suffer another point of Dexterity damage. If a
      creature enters this area of darkness or blot after it is created, they
      must immediately save or also suffer this damage. A creature may only be
      affected by Numbing Darkness once per round, regardless of how many times
      they enter or exit the area that turn.</p>
