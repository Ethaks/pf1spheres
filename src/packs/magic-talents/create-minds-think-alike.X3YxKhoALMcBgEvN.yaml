      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Exquisite Detail),
      Enhancement sphere (Bestow Intelligence (enhance)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may create a statue or similar object which is a perfect likeness
      of yourself or another creature, even if you could not ordinarily succeed
      at a Craft check to create an object of that complexity.</p>

      <p>This statue may be any size you choose, to a maximum of the largest
      object size you could create. An object created this way is still a
      statue, and while details can be as close to accurate as possible, the
      object is not mistaken for a real creature without additional
      disguises.</p>

      <p>When you enhance a target using the Bestow Intelligence talent to grant
      an object intelligence, you may spend an additional spell point to grant
      the target object an imprinted duplicate of your mind. The target gains
      all your mental traits and quirks, such as your memories and mannerisms.
      This allows the target to use either its normal skill ranks and modifiers,
      if it possesses any, or your skill ranks and modifiers, whichever is
      better. The target does not gain any other abilities because of this
      effect. The target&#8217;s starting attitude is friendly towards you, as
      normal, and the target is aware of the circumstances of its sentience and
      how you created it, but its attitude may change.</p>
