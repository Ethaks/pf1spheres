      <p>You may treat your companion as if it had the Cooperative Crafting feat
      and possessed all your Craft skill ranks and item creation feats. All
      Craft and Profession skills are class skills for your companion. This
      talent does not remove the need for your companion to have appropriate
      anatomy in order to be capable of crafting.</p>
