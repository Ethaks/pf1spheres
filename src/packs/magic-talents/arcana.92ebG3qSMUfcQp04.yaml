      <p>Where most normal motifs grant a brief glimpse of the target&#8217;s
      fate, and ends with a short lived burst of power, some Fate casters learn
      to weave additional prophecy into their motifs.</p>

      <p>(Arcana) talents are unique (motif) talents which can either be cast
      normally as a motif or attached to another motif as part of casting it.
      When casting any motif, the caster may attach one (arcana) to that motif,
      which is hereafter referred to as the &#8220;attached motif&#8221;.
      Attaching an (arcana) to a motif does not cost the caster any additional
      spell points or increase the casting time of the attached motif.</p>

      <p>While attached to another motif, an (arcana) talent functions in the
      following ways:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>An (arcana) shares its duration with the attached motif, and ends when
      the attached motif ends.</li>

      <li>An (arcana) does not grant bonuses while attached to another motif,
      and only adds its discharge effect to the attached motif&#8217;s discharge
      (e.g. the pentacle&#8217;s bonus to one saving throw would not apply while
      being attached and only grants the discharge benefit for rerolls on saving
      throws).</li>

      <li>An (arcana) cannot be discharged for its additional effect
      independently, and only grants its discharge effect when the attached
      motif is discharged.</li>

      <li>A caster may only attach one (arcana) to another (motif) talent,
      though feats, items, and other features may affect this. An (arcana)
      talent can not be attached to the same (arcana) when cast as a motif. For
      example, you cannot attach Swords to Swords as a motif, but can attach
      Swords to Cups as a motif.</li>

      </ul>
