      "value": "<p>By activating this fey-blessing, you gain a pouch of fairy dust. This pouch has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level. The pouch is weightless and may not be used to hold anything other than the fairy dust it contains. If the pouch is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends. Destroying the pouch fills a 10-foot radius with the chosen fairy dust, affecting all creatures in the area, including the caster. A successful saving throw against any effect that allows it grants the affected creature immunity to that effect from that caster for 24 hours. You gain knowledge of two types of fairy dust when you gain this talent; you may activate any one type of dust that you know when activating this fey-blessing. Choose from the following options:</p>\n<p><strong>Amnesia:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or forget the past minute. This otherwise functions as the Amnesia talent greater charm of the Mind sphere. You must spend an additional spell point for this option.</p>\n<p><strong>Bleed:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or bleed profusely when wounded. The next time the creature takes hit point damage, it begins taking bleed damage equal to your caster level. These bleed damage may be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or by receiving any amount of healing. If this dust is applied to a weapon, the weapon attack triggers the bleed damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Blind:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Reflex save or treat all other creatures as having concealment for 1 round per caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Charm:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or have its disposition toward you increase by 1 step to a maximum of friendly for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Fear:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or be shaken for 1 round per caster level. You may spend an additional spell point as part of activating the fey-blessing to instead have affected creatures be frightened for 1 round per caster level on a failed save and shaken for 1 round on a successful save.</p>\n<p><strong>Glitter:</strong> For 1 round per caster level, affected creatures take a penalty to Stealth equal to caster level and do not gain concealment from any effect that provides invisibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Poison:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save or suffer from itching poison, being compelled to scratch at the wound for 1 round (treat this as being dazed) and taking 1d2 Strength damage per round. This effect ends after 1 minute, but targets are allowed a new saving throw each round to end the effect early. You must spend an additional spell point for this option.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleep:</strong> Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save or fall asleep for 1 round per caster level. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). You must spend an additional spell point for this option.</p>\n<p>If you possess Fairy Flight, you also gain the following option:</p>\n<p><strong>Flight:</strong> For 1 minute per caster level, affected creatures gain the benefits of your Fairy Flight fey-blessing. This flight speed requires maintaining the proper frame of mind; if an affected creature is under the effects of an emotion or fear effect while flying, its fly speed from this ability is suppressed and it falls at a rate of 50 feet per round until it lands (taking falling damage as normal) or the emotion or fear effect ends.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you may fill a 5-foot cube within close range with the dust, affecting any creature in that space. As a move action, you may apply fairy dust to a weapon, natural weapon, or piece of ammunition you possess, or as a standard action you may apply it to a number of weapons or pieces of ammunition equal to your casting ability modifier (minimum 2) within close range. A creature that is struck by the weapon within 1 round per caster level of it being so treated suffers from the effects of the dust, ending the effect on the weapon. You may choose to end this fey-blessing early, drawing and throwing the pouch to create a 20-foot radius spread of fairy dust within close range, affecting all creatures within the area.</p>\n<p>The duration of multiple applications of dust stack. The pouch replenishes itself as a free action for the duration of the fey-blessing, then disappears when it ends. You may have multiple instances of this fey-blessing active at once; select a different option you know for each. Each instance creates a separate pouch. If the pouch is not in your possession at the start of your turn, you can summon it to yourself as a move action as long as you have line of sight to it. You may select this talent multiple times; each time you gain two more types of fairy dust.</p>\n",
