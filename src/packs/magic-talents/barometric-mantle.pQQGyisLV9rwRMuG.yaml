      <p>Creatures bearing your mantle immediately know when weather within your
      control weather range is being manipulated, such as with the control
      weather ability. Although they do not automatically know who or what is
      changing the weather, they do learn in what way the weather is being
      manipulated (such as what weather conditions are being affected, and
      whether the severity levels are being raised or lowered). They may also
      predict the natural weather within medium range for the next 48 hours and
      gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against the effect of weather (natural or
      magically manipulated). If you possess the Climate advanced talent they
      recognize altered weather and predict natural weather at a range of 2
      miles.</p>
