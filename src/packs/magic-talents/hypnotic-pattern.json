      "value": "<p>You may spend a spell point when creating bright light to fascinate creatures. All creatures within this area of bright light that can see become fascinated (Will negates) for as long as they remain within this area of bright light. These targets take no action on their turn but to stare into the light, and suffer a -4 penalty to all Perception checks. A target is allowed a new saving throw each round to throw off the effect, and on a successful save, may make their actions as normal. Once a target has saved against this effect, they are immune to the effect for the rest of its duration. Hostile action taken against a hypnotized target automatically breaks the effect, as if the target had succeeded at their saving throw. If the target was already in combat when this ability is used, they gain a +2 bonus to their initial saving throw.</p>\n",
