    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to place an alter time effect onto an
      adjacent, unoccupied 5-foot square in addition to the normal costs of that
      effect. Any creature who steps onto the square activates the alter time
      effect; if it is normally a targeted ability, the creature is immediately
      affected by that ability, though they are allowed a saving throw as
      normal, if appropriate.</p>

      <p>If the alter time effect normally creates an area effect, the square
      itself is used as the center of that effect (even if it would normally be
      centered on the caster) and all creatures within the area are immediately
      affected by the ability, attempting saves as normal if appropriate. Any
      alter time effect with a duration longer than instantaneous lasts for 1
      round per caster level, regardless of its normal duration, though you may
      dismiss it on your turn as a free action.</p>

      <p>You may only have 1 active temporal trap at a time; placing a second
      trap deactivates the first. Temporal traps may be made permanent with the
      permanency spell or ritual; permanent temporal traps do not count against
      your total number of active traps and automatically reset after their
      duration expires.</p>

      <p>When used with an ability that includes a variable cost, such as the
      Time Clone advanced talent, the cost must be paid up front; if the cost is
      insufficient to affect the creature that triggers this effect, the trap is
      not activated. If the variable cost is greater than required to affect the
      triggering creature, the excess spell points are wasted but the trap and
      effect otherwise occur as normal.</p>

      <p>You may select this talent multiple times, increasing the number of
      temporal traps you may have active at once by 1 each time you do so.</p>
