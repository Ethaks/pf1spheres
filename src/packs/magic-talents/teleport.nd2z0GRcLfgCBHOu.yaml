      <p>You can spend a standard action to teleport yourself and up to a heavy
      load to any place within close range. Alternatively, you may teleport a
      touched willing creature and their carried equipment instead of yourself.
      You may spend a spell point to increase your teleport range to medium
      instead of close. You must have line of sight to your destination.</p>
