      <p>As a standard action, you may grant a creature within close range the
      benefit of your fey-link. To target an unwilling creature, you must spend
      a spell point and it is allowed a Will save to negate the effect.</p>

      <p>You may grant fey-blessings to a creature under the effects of your
      fey-link as a free action as long as it is within close range. If the
      creature is under the effects of a fey-blessing that requires the use of
      spell points, your spell points are used, though if you are not willing
      you can prevent the activation and end the feylink as an immediate
      action.</p>

      <p>If a fey-blessing summons an object (such as Aelfwine, Crown Of The
      Courts, Enchanting Music, or Fairy Dust), the creature you share the
      fey-blessing has the object appear in its possession and is treated as the
      caster for the purpose of using that object.</p>

      <p>You may gain this talent multiple times. Increase the range by one step
      each time this is gained beyond the 1st (close to medium, medium to long).
      Taking this talent multiple times counts as a [range] talent.</p>
