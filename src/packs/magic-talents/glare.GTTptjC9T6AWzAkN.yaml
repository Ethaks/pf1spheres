      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, causing sunlight to blind
      it. The target is dazzled and treats all targets at a higher elevation
      than it as having concealment. Other creatures can also pinpoint its
      location in non-magical darkness, though it still has complete concealment
      unless they have senses that pierce the darkness.</p>
