    value: >
      <p>Your companion gains the ability to rage, as the barbarian class
      feature, for a number of rounds per day equal to the higher of its
      Constitution modifier and its Hit Dice. While in rage, the companion gains
      a +4 morale bonus to its Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale
      bonus on Will saves. In addition, it takes a &#8211;2 penalty to Armor
      Class. The increase to Constitution grants the companion 2 hit points per
      Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first
      like temporary hit points. While in rage, a companion cannot use any
      Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics,
      Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or
      concentration.</p>

      <p>The companion can end its rage as a free action and is fatigued after
      rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in
      the rage. The companion cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or
      exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single
      encounter or combat.</p>

      <p>The duration of the fatigue or exhaustion expires even when the
      companion is not summoned. If the companion falls unconscious, its rage
      immediately ends, placing it in peril of dismissal from hit point
      loss.</p>

      <p>The companion may take rage powers in place of feats, if it qualifies
      for them, using its Hit Dice in place of barbarian levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If your GM permits, you may instead use the
      rage ability per the unchained barbarian, modifying the above ability
      accordingly.</p>
