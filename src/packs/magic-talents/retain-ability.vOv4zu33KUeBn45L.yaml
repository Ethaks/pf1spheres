    value: >
      <p>Choose a number of extraordinary or supernatural abilities dependent on
      your target&#8217;s base form (darkvision, scent, racial breath weapon,
      etc.). You may choose to allow the target to retain these abilities in
      place of trait you would normally grant them as part of your shapeshift,
      at a cost of one trait per ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Catmera Form: [Catgirl HB addendum]</strong> You may spend 1
      additional spell point as part of granting a shapeshift to one or more
      targets, causing the resulting shapeshift effect to blend with the
      target&#8217;s natural form. The resulting shapeshift causes the target to
      assume a hybrid form, gaining all limbs, natural attacks, special
      abilities, and movement moves of the shapeshift without changing the
      target&#8217;s base form or melding any of their equipment. The target may
      choose to retain limbs and movement speeds from their base form if the
      shapeshift lacks them or has lesser versions and may choose to forgo any
      additional limbs or heads when receiving this shapeshift and are able to
      effectively choose their body make-up resulting from this shapeshift. A
      shapeshift effect granted this way does not cause the target&#8217;s
      equipment to meld with this hybrid form.</p>

      <p>If the shapeshift would grant the target additional legs, the target
      may instead gain them as arms, although they are treated as arms gained
      with the Additional Limbs &#8220;two secondary arms&#8221; trait.</p>

      <p><em>Example:</em> This talent is similar to the Hybrid Transformation
      feat, allowing a shapeshifted target to pick and choose their resulting
      form&#8217;s qualities. A humanoid being subject to a shapeshift modified
      by this talent could choose to keep their arms when assuming a hybrid form
      based on Serpentine Transformation or add legs to Aquan Transformation. A
      winged creature could retain their wings under an Animalistic
      Transformation.</p>
