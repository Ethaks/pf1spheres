    value: >
      <p>Choose either animals or vermin. You may spend a spell point to gain
      the ability to speak with your chosen creature type for 1 minute per
      caster level. You can ask questions of and receive answers from them, but
      this does not make them any more friendly than normal. Mindless vermin
      cannot understand or answer with more than basic information, wary and
      cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, and stupid creatures
      make inane comments. If a creature is friendly toward you, it may do some
      favor or service for you. You may take this talent twice, gaining both
      options.</p>
