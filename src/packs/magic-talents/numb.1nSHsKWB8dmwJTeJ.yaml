    value: >
      <p>You may cut off flow to parts of a creature&#8217;s body, making fine
      manipulation difficult. The target takes a -2 penalty on Strength and
      Dexterity checks (including initiative) and Strength and Dexterity-based
      skill checks and gains an equal bonus on saves against pain effects for
      the duration of the blood control. This penalty increases by +1 at 5th
      caster level and again every 5 caster levels thereafter. This effect may
      change a creature&#8217;s place in the initiative count after combat has
      begun.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to slow blood flow, staggering the target
      for the duration of the blood control.</p>
