      <p>When you cause a creature to glow, you can help eradicate toxic
      substances they are afflicted with, granting them a +1 circumstance bonus
      on all Fortitude saves against poisons and diseases, increasing by 1 for
      every 10 caster levels. When you cause an object to glow, as an
      instantaneous effect you may purify rotten, diseased or poisonous food and
      drink, causing it to become suitable for consumption. This has no effect
      on magical diseases or poisons.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a light of purification.
      Creatures within the area of the bright light gain a +2 circumstance bonus
      on saves against contracting new diseases and against the application of
      new poisons, increasing by 1 for every 4 caster levels. Additionally, as
      long as a creature currently suffering from a disease or poison stays
      within the bright light, all diseases and poisons currently active on them
      are suppressed, and any penalties bestowed by the disease no longer affect
      the creature, although this does not remove any ability damage, drain or
      negative levels the disease already bestowed. This does not stop the
      spread of diseases or poisons, nor makes creatures immune to them, but
      simply prevents the application of new effects they would suffer from
      additional saving throws.</p>
