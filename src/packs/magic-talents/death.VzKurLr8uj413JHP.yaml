      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere (one (motif) talent),
      caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may grant a motif that allows a target to preserve and, ultimately,
      change the other motifs they bear. While this motif is active, whenever
      the target discharges a (motif) talent other than Death there is a 50%
      chance that it does not end. The target may discharge this effect to
      immediately bring one other (motif) talent you or they know into effect
      with a duration equal to this motif &#8217;s remaining duration. Granting
      this motif costs two spell points.</p>
