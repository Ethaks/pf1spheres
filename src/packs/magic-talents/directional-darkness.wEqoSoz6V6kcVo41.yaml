      <p>Your area of darkness only blocks the light from one vantage point. If
      your darkness is in the form of a wall, it hampers vision from one side
      and appears clear from the other. If it is spherical, the caster may
      choose either for those within the area of darkness to see clearly or for
      those outside to see within clearly. The boundaries of the area of
      darkness remain obvious to those who can see through it unhindered.</p>
