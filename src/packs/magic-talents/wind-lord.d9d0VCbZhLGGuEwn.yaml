      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weather sphere, caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>When using control weather to create or alter wind, increase the
      highest severity level you may create or alter by 1. In addition, when you
      use your control weather to affect wind, you may also turn that wind up to
      90 degrees in any direction. This can change the general direction of a
      tornado (provided you can affect winds of that severity) although detailed
      control is not possible.</p>

      <p>Not only can you control the wind&#8217;s direction, but you may also
      create complicated patterns. You may create an &#8220;eye&#8221; of calm
      air up to 80 feet in diameter at the center of the area if you so desire
      and may choose any of the following patterns for the wind:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You may create a downdraft that blows from the center outward in equal
      strength in all directions.</li>

      <li>You may create an updraft that blows from the outer edges in toward
      the center in equal strength from all directions, veering upward before
      impinging on the eye in the center.</li>

      <li>You may create a rotation that causes the winds to circle the center
      in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion.</li>

      </ul>
