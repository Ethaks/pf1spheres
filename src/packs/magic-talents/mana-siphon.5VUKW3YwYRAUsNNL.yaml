      <p>You may cause your destructive blast to sap the magic energy from your
      target, funneling it to you. A mana siphon does nonlethal force damage
      using d4 instead of d6 as its damage die and any creature struck by the
      attack or that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or lose 1 spell point. This loss increases by
      one die size (1d2, 1d3, 1d4, 1d6, etc.) for every five caster levels. You
      gain an equal number of temporary spell points that last for one round per
      caster level, though you cannot receive more spell points than your target
      loses. These temporary spell points do not stack with spell points from
      other targets, other instances of this ability, or any other source.</p>
