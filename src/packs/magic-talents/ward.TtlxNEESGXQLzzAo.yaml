      <p>As a standard action, you may create a ward centered on yourself with a
      radius of up to 10 feet + 5 feet per caster level, but can also be made so
      small as to only cover yourself. Wards remain as long as you concentrate,
      but you may spend a spell point to allow them to remain for 1 round per
      caster level without concentration. Wards remain in the location they were
      created, even if you move (however, if the ward is created entirely on top
      of a vehicle, it will move with that vehicle). If a ward affects targets
      inside it, its effects are subject to spell resistance.</p>
