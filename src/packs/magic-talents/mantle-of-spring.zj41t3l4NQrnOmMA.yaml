      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Plant Growth:</strong> A single plant or creature of the plant
      type that you touch increases its size by one category. This increases by
      one category per 10 caster levels. This effect persists for as long as you
      are within 30 feet of the target, until you end it as a free action, you
      choose to apply it to a different target, or the fey-link ends. Unwilling
      creatures are permitted a Will save to negate this effect. This effect
      bypasses the immunity to polymorph effects of the plant type. For
      creatures of the plant type, see the Size Change talent in the Alteration
      sphere to see the effects of growing to their new size.</p>

      <p>This ability cannot cause creatures to grow larger than Huge. At 5th
      caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter, this limit increases by
      one size category, to a maximum of Colossal at 15th caster level. This is
      a polymorph effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Verdant Step:</strong> You may cause flowers, grass, and small
      vines to spring up wherever you step. The rapid, clinging growth creates
      difficult terrain in any space you enter until the start of your next
      turn. You are not hindered by this difficult terrain. This effect may be
      halted or resumed as a free action. If you spend a spell point as a free
      action, this growth instead remains for 1 minute per caster level. This
      ability does not function if you are not touching the ground.</p>

      <p>This growth is considered sufficient to be a target by any abilities of
      the (plant) package of the Nature sphere that requires plants (but not
      large growths such as trees) until the start of your next turn or for 1
      minute per caster level when using the spell point option. After this time
      expires, the growth fades away and any ongoing effects requiring it
      end.</p>
