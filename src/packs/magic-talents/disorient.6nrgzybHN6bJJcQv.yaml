      <p>As an expunge, you may damage the target creature&#8217;s control over
      their magic. The target must succeed at a successful Will save; on failure
      they suffer a -2 penalty to their caster level for the next sphere ability
      they use during the duration of this ability. If this reduces the ability
      to a caster level below 0, the manifested ability fails and any spell
      points used are lost. This penalty is increased by an additional 1 for
      every four caster levels you possess. This ability lasts for up to 1
      minute per caster level, or until the target uses a sphere ability.</p>
