      <p>Your destructive blast deals negative energy damage. Any creature
      struck by the attack or that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was
      required must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round.
      Undead creatures take no damage, but are instead blinded for 1 round on a
      failed Fortitude save. This bypasses the immunities of the undead
      type.</p>
