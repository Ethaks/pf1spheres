      "value": "<p>You may create spikes on an object or the ground that deal damage to targets who run into or pass over them. If a target is pushed onto spikes (such as through a successful bull rush) or steps onto them, make a touch attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack bonus. If successful, the target suffers piercing damage equal to your caster level (minimum 1) and has its land speed reduced by half if the wound was administered to its feet. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the creature is treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of fast healing/magical healing/regeneration. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it enters an area covered in spikes. A creature may move at half speed through this area without risking damage to itself. Spikes added to a dropped object do not increase the damage of the falling object, though spikes added to a wall count as increasing its size as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>When placing spikes or any other form of hazardous terrain directly underneath a target, they are allowed a Reflex saving throw. Success means they suffer no effect from the hazardous terrain in that square until the end of their next turn. Attempting to move into or through such hazardous squares affects the target normally. It is also possible, through certain talents, to create other forms of hazardous terrain, such as grease, ice, acid, or other materials. Hazardous terrain created in this fashion functions as normal for its kind.</p>\n",
