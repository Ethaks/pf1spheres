      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Organ Detachment
      (advanced, space)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may use Organ Detachment to safely remove a creature&#8217;s brain
      without harming the creature. A detached brain is still able to think and
      direct the body if detached. If a creature&#8217;s brain remains intact,
      it may survive without a body so long as it possesses a mechanism to gain
      oxygen and nutrients (such apparatuses can be built through magical and
      technological means and usually cost 20,000 gp).</p>
