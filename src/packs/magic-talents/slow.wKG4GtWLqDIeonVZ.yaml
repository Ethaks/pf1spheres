    value: >
      <p>You slow the target&#8217;s movements and perception of time. The
      target has its movement speeds halved (minimum 5 feet) and suffers a -1
      penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves (Will negates). This penalty
      increases by 1 per 10 caster levels you possess. You must concentrate to
      maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a free action to
      increase its duration to 1 round per caster level without
      concentration.</p>

      <p>If a Haste and Slow ability are used on the same creature, the second
      caster must attempt a magic skill check against the effect of the first
      caster. On a failure the target is unaffected. On a success, the effects
      counter each other, leaving neither in place.</p>

      <p>Some Time talents are marked (time). These talents grant you additional
      alter time abilities.</p>
