      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((earth) package, Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>\n<p>As an instantaneous effect, you may spend 3 spell points to create an earthquake, affecting an 80-foot radius area. The powerful shockwave created by this ability knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground cannot move or attack. A caster on the ground must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 20 + 1/2 the caster level) or lose any spell or sphere effect they try to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake depends on the nature of the terrain where it is created.</p>\n<p><strong>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:</strong> The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area who are below the falling debris and rubble.</p>\n<p><strong>Cliffs:</strong> The earthquake causes cliffs to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Open Ground:</strong> Each creature standing in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the earthquake, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Suffocation rules in Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide for more details).</p>\n<p><strong>Structure:</strong> Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>River, Lake, or Marsh:</strong> Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of this effect, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. After the earthquake ends, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p>\n<p><strong>Pinned Beneath Rubble:</strong> Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must attempt a DC 15 Constitution check each minute thereafter until freed or dead, suffering 1d6 points of lethal damage for each failed save.</p>\n",
