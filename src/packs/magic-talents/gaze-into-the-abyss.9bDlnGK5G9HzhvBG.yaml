      <p>You tap into a well of blackness so deep that it extends beyond the
      merely visible, threatening to draw in anyone attempting to examine your
      spellwork with magically enhanced vision. Anyone attempting to divine or
      determine magical, alignment, or psychic auras of a person or object under
      the effect of your (blot), (darkness), or (shadow) talents must succeed at
      a magical skill check against your MSD or becomes stunned as if viewing an
      overwhelming aura (see the Divination sphere). Those who fail this check
      gain no information and automatically fail any further attempt against any
      target protected by the same caster&#8217;s Gaze Into The Abyss for 24
      hours.</p>
