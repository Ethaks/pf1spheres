      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere (Enduring
      Protection), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When creating a ward, you may spend 2 spell points to increase its
      duration to permanent. A complex glyph can be made permanent as a normal
      glyph can, except for those complex glyphs that trigger non-magical
      traps.</p>

      <p>When a permanent glyph is triggered, it uses its ward or sphere
      ability. For abilities with a duration, the glyph activates the ability
      and then maintains it as if it were concentrating on it for as long as the
      trigger is satisfied. For an attack ability, the glyph attacks a randomly
      selected creature in range of both the ability and the glyph itself once
      per round until there are no longer any targets to attack.</p>

      <p>The glyph always has an initiative equal to its caster level and does
      not roll a d20 or add any modifiers to its initiative. To be turned into a
      permanent glyph, a ward or other sphere ability must be usable as a
      full-round action or shorter without costing any spell points to use. If
      the caster has abilities that allows them to reduce spell point cost by
      increasing casting time, they may apply them, provided the casting time
      stays at a fullround action or less.</p>
