      <p>You gain the following abilities which allow you to reanimate
      incomplete corpses and individual corpse parts:</p>

      <p><strong>Reanimate Piecemeal Undead:</strong> You can reanimate an
      individual part or parts of a corpse as a piecemeal undead, such as
      reanimating a corpse&#8217;s arm or skull or a torso with an arm. When
      reanimating piecemeal undead this way, use the statistics of an
      appropriately sized animated object (see the Enhancement sphere, Ultimate
      Spheres of Power pg. 288, 577) with the undead construction flaw and no
      other construction point abilities or construction flaws. Piecemeal undead
      otherwise count as an undead creature you reanimated, count against the
      total number of reanimated creatures you may have active at any one time
      normally, and obey your commands as normal for an undead you reanimated. A
      piecemeal undead will usually be anywhere from three sizes smaller to
      approximately the same size as the original corpse. See Table: Piecemeal
      Undead to determine the appropriate animated object size for a piecemeal
      undead.</p>

      <p>A piecemeal undead is not a skeleton or zombie and cannot be modified
      by the Expanded Necromancy talent, except as described below. Piecemeal
      undead do not count as animated objects for the purposes of Enhancement
      sphere talents, feats, and other abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Infuse Piecemeal Undead:</strong> You can grant an intact
      undead under your control the ability to split off parts of itself to
      create piecemeal undead as described in the Reanimate Piecemeal Undead
      ability. As a standard action, or as a free action when reanimating one or
      more undead, you may spend a spell point to grant one undead within your
      dominion range the ability to split off a part of itself. If you possess
      Mass Death Magic, you may spend an additional spell point to grant this
      ability to 1 additional undead per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). An undead
      granted the ability to split off a part of itself can spend a full-round
      action to create a piecemeal undead of an appropriate size to the body
      part used into an adjacent, unoccupied space (such as a zombie tearing off
      its own arm or hand, or the skull of a skeleton popping off). You must be
      able to control the Hit Dice of a piecemeal undead created this way or it
      fails to be created. Piecemeal undead created this way share the duration
      of the reanimate effect which initially created the intact undead it was
      separated from and possesses any properties (including defensive
      abilities, special abilities, and special attacks) possessed by that
      undead, subject to GM discretion, but does not increase any existing
      defensive abilities it would possess as a piecemeal undead (such as damage
      reduction or natural armor). This can include abilities granted by a
      variant, such as those from the Expanded Necromancy talent, allowing for a
      bloody skeleton to separate its arm from itself to create an appropriately
      sized &#8220;bloody&#8221; piecemeal undead with the fast healing and
      deathless qualities from the bloody skeleton variant.</p>

      <p>Only undead raised from intact corpses, such as those normally
      available without this talent, can be granted the ability to split with
      this talent; piecemeal undead can never be granted the ability to split
      off parts of themselves. An intact undead can only separate a single part
      of itself as a piecemeal undead at any given time, but can spend a move
      action when within reach of the piecemeal undead created from its body to
      rejoin with it. When an undead separates a part of itself to create a
      piecemeal undead, it loses a number of hit points equal to the piecemeal
      undead&#8217;s hit points, to a maximum of half the intact undead&#8217;s
      current hit points. If the body part used grants the intact undead a
      natural attack (such as a skeleton removing its arm), that undead loses
      that natural attack until it rejoins with the piecemeal undead. If the
      body part is one of the intact undead&#8217;s legs or wings, it reduces
      its movement speed with the appropriate movement type by 10 feet until it
      rejoins with the piecemeal undead.</p>
