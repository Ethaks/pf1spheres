      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Divination sphere, caster level
      1st.</p>

      <p>Like alternate divinations, this advanced talent grants additional
      divinations depending upon what other spheres you know. Unlike alternate
      divinations, however, this advanced talent grants new sense abilities
      instead of divine abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Creation: Material Sense:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points
      to gain material sense, automatically detecting the presence of a single
      material you could create or alter within close range as if you could see
      it (the material is chosen when you cast this sense). A character can use
      material sense to distinguish color or visual contrast so long as the
      distinct components are perceptible if one can only see the specific
      materials sensed (for example, a character who selects ink with material
      sense could read documents written in ink but could not see goldfoil
      illuminations). However, the character is not subject to gaze attacks,
      blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense.
      A character can detect creatures who have the material as part of their
      body but does need line of effect to detect objects made of the material.
      Material Sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate Aura
      talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Dark: See in Darkness:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points to
      gain the see in darkness ability. The creature can see perfectly in all
      darkness, including magical darkness that otherwise might obstruct
      darkvision.</p>

      <p><strong>Death: Spirit Sense:</strong> You may spend a spell point to
      gain the spirit sense ability, which allows you to know when immortal or
      deathless beings are nearby. You automatically sense the presence of
      undead; fey; outsiders; and astral, ethereal, or incorporeal creatures
      within close range, as if you could see them. A character cannot use
      spirit sense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to
      gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with
      only this sense. A character cannot perceive noncreature nonliving
      material using spirit sense but does need line of effect to detect
      creatures. Spirit sense can be foiled by illusions with the Manipulate
      Aura talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Life: Lifesense:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points to gain
      lifesense, automatically detecting the life force of beings within close
      range as if you could see them. A character cannot use lifesense to
      distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to gaze attacks,
      blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with only this sense.
      A character cannot perceive nonliving material or nonliving creatures
      (such as constructs or undead) using lifesense, but does need line of
      effect to detect creatures. Lifesense can be foiled by illusions with the
      Manipulate Aura talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Mind: Thoughtsense:</strong> You may spend a spell point to
      gain the thoughtsense ability. You automatically detect and locate
      conscious creatures within close range who you could target with your Mind
      sphere abilities as if you could see them.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point, you may detect and locate all
      types of conscious creatures, not just those that you could affect with
      mind-affecting effects. Nondetection, Unplottable, and similar effects
      block thoughtsense.</p>

      <p>Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or
      greater) and nonsentient (Intelligence 1&#8211;2) creatures, but otherwise
      provides no information about the creatures it detects. Creatures lacking
      an Intelligence score, or with a score less than 1, cannot be detected or
      located with thoughtsense unless you have selected that creature&#8217;s
      type with the Recondite Stimuli talent. A character cannot use
      thoughtsense to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not subject to
      gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a target with
      only this sense. A character cannot perceive nonliving material using
      thoughtsense, but does need line of effect to detect creatures.
      Thoughtsense can be foiled by illusions with the Implausible Deniability
      feat.</p>

      <p><strong>Telekinesis: Touchsight:</strong> You may spend 2 spell points
      to gain the touchsight ability. You gain the ability to &#8220;feel&#8221;
      your surroundings even when your sight would otherwise be obscured by your
      physical environment. Your touchsight field emanates from you out to close
      range. You ignore invisibility, darkness, and concealment, though you must
      have line of effect to a creature or an object to discern it. You
      automatically detect and pinpoint all creatures within close range as if
      you could see them. In many circumstances, comparing your regular senses
      to what you learn with touchsight is enough to tell you the difference
      between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed creatures. A character
      cannot use touchsight to distinguish color or visual contrast and is not
      subject to gaze attacks, blinding, or visual effects when perceiving a
      target with only this sense. Touchsight can be foiled by illusions with
      the Illusionary Touch talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Weather: Storm Vision:</strong> You may spend a spell point to
      gain a special sense granting the ability to negate any concealment, miss
      chance, and penalties to Perception directly caused by weather such as
      rain or fog (be they magical or natural).</p>
