      <p>When creating a manabond, you may spend a spell point to allow your
      manabond to manifest as a physical cord connecting yourself and the target
      creature, although you must have line of effect to the target. These
      physical bonds are tough, durable chains made of raw energy that inhibit
      movement. The two creatures connected by such a manabond cannot move
      further than the maximum range for the manabond without either destroying
      the tether (hardness equal to your caster level, hit points equal to twice
      your caster level + 5, AC 10), or by making a Strength check to burst it
      with a DC equal to your Mana sphere DC. Destroying the tether does not end
      the manabond, but does cause it to lose its physicality, removing any
      effects granted by this talent. When moving past the maximum range of the
      manabond, a creature affected by this talent may make a drag attempt as a
      free action made as part of any movement they make, allowing them to pull
      the creature in the direction they move, up to a maximum amount of
      distance determined by the drag attempt. The host of a hardened bond may
      use their caster level + their casting ability modifier in place of their
      combat maneuver bonus, and gain a bonus equal to twice their caster level
      to their combat maneuver defense on drag attempts made against them using
      the hardened bond. In addition, you may create shorter manabonds than
      normal.</p>

      <p>When creating one, they can be as short as 5 feet, or as long as your
      normal maximum range, but they must be measured in 5 feet increments. You
      can shorten or lengthen them as part of the action made to concentrate on
      them, although if the cord is not long enough to reach the target creature
      after shrinking it will break and end the effect.</p>
