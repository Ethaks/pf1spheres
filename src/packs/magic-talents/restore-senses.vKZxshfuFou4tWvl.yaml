    value: >
      <p>Your cure ability heals an additional 1 hit point per caster level.
      When restoring a target&#8217;s mind, the target is also cured of the
      confused and dazed conditions, and the frightened and panicked conditions
      are completely removed rather than lessened; as well as all temporary or
      magical removal of their senses. This includes blindness, deafness, loss
      of tremorsense, blindsense, etc. If playing with sanity rules, this also
      cures 1d4 points of sanity damage.</p>
