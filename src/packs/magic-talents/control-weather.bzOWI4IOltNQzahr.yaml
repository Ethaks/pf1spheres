      <p>As a standard action, you may control all weather within medium range,
      adjusting either the wind, temperature, or precipitation levels. If you
      are in a confined area such as inside a building, your control only
      extends to the edge of that space.</p>

      <p>This change in weather lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may
      always spend a spell point as a free action to allow this change to
      continue for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. When using
      control weather to change the weather&#8217;s severity, the change happens
      1 level change per category per round until the desired severity is
      reached. When the effect ends, the severity of the altered weather
      categories returns to normal by 1 step per round.</p>

      <p>If you are maintaining the effect through concentration, the effect
      moves with you, raising and lowering the severity of unaffected or
      no-longer affected area as described above. If it is being maintained
      through a spell point, it remains stationary.</p>

      <p>Wind has 7 steps of severity, while temperature and humidity have 13.
      Temperature is divided between &#8216;Heat&#8217; and &#8216;Cold&#8217;,
      each with 7 steps of severity. (If the temperature is lowered below step 1
      of Cold, it becomes step 2 of Heat. If the temperature is lowered below
      step 1 of Heat, it becomes step 2 of Cold.) Likewise, humidity is divided
      between &#8216;Precipitation&#8217; and &#8216;Aridity&#8217;, which
      follows a similar setup. An average day of no wind, no rain, and
      unremarkable temperature is assumed to be at severity level 1 for all
      categories.</p>

      <p>At 1st caster level, you may create weather of severity level 1, 2 or
      3. This improves by one severity level per 7 caster levels to a maximum of
      severity level 7. You may create weather of up to this severity, or lower
      the severity of pre-existing weather if it is within this limit. If the
      natural weather is of a higher severity level than you can affect, you
      cannot use control weather to alter that aspect of the weather.</p>

      <p>If two casters are controlling weather in the same location and
      affecting different categories, both effects happen normally.</p>

      <p>If both casters are affecting the same category, the second caster must
      be able to affect the weather&#8217;s new severity, and must succeed at a
      magic skill check to wrestle control from the first caster. On the first
      caster&#8217;s subsequent turn, if he maintains his own control weather
      effect, he must succeed at his own magic skill check to wrestle control of
      the weather back from the second caster. If the first caster is
      maintaining their effect through a spell point instead of concentration
      and the second caster succeeds at their magic skill check, the first
      caster&#8217;s weather effect is suppressed for as long as the second
      caster uses control weather. Once the second caster&#8217;s effect ends,
      the first caster&#8217;s effect resumes functioning, provided its duration
      has not already expired.</p>

      <p>The following is a description of all the different effects one can
      create with the Weather sphere. See the Pathfinder Core rulebook for more
      details on weather and environmental effects. Depending on the terrain, a
      GM could rule additional effects happen; rain can cause rivers or enclosed
      spaces to flood, Cold can create ice sheets on flat terrain, etc.
      Generally, weather conditions from different categories stack. (Thus, if
      Wind, Cold, and Precipitation were all increased to Severity level 5, the
      area would be under the effects of the appropriate Wind, Cold, and Snow
      effects, all at the same time.)</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is impossible to raise weather above severity
      level 7. However, for every effective level above severity level 7 a
      caster&#8217;s control weather would otherwise be able to reach, all
      numbers associated with that weather type, including DCs or penalties, are
      increased by 1.</p>
