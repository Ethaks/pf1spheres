      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Create Gap (space) or
      Unseeing Teleport).</p>

      <p>When a creature would be shunted into an already-occupied space by your
      teleport or the end of your create gap, the target takes 1d6 additional
      damage for every 5 caster levels you possess from being shunted from an
      occupied space and becomes staggered for 1 round per caster level unless
      they succeed at a Fortitude save.</p>
