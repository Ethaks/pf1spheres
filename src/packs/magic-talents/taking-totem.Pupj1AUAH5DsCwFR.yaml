    value: >
      <p>You must spend a spell point in order to create a taking totem.
      Whenever a creature is subjected to a negative energy effect that causes
      them to regain or lose hit points (but not temporary hit points granted or
      ability damage dealt) the number of hit points gained or lost increases by
      your caster level or the original value, whichever is less.</p>
