      <p>Your cure and invigorate abilities function on creatures who have died
      within no more than 1 round. If the target&#8217;s new hit point total is
      at a negative amount greater than its Constitution score, then it comes
      back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. Otherwise the
      target remains dead. Creatures brought back to life in this manner gain a
      temporary negative level.</p>
