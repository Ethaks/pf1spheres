      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bear sphere, 5th caster level or
      higher.</p>

      <p>As a full-round action you may draw a 10-ft. diameter circle on the
      ground and spend a spell point. The area inside the circle becomes immune
      to bears; all targets therein gain a +2 to AC and saving throws made
      against attacks or effects created by bears, and bears cannot break the
      circle nor cross beyond its boundaries. When creating an antarctic circle,
      the creator can spend an additional spell point to increase the
      circle&#8217;s power, granting bonuses against and repelling all animals,
      rather than only bears. An antarctic circle lasts for up to 1 hour per
      caster level, but if broken (such as by someone scuffing the drawing), the
      effect ends early.</p>
