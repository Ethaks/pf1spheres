    value: >
      <p>If a target would fail their saving throw against one of your charms,
      you may spend a spell point to force them to immediately attempt a second
      Will saving throw. If they fail this second saving throw, a mental
      weakness is created with the creatures mind, allowing you to bypass the
      creature&#8217;s will easier.</p>

      <p>For 1 minute per caster level, the creature takes a -2 penalty on Will
      saving throws made against your charms. This penalty increases by 1 for
      every 10 caster levels you possess.</p>
