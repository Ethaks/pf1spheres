      <p>You may spend a spell point to make a telekinetic Catch as an immediate
      action. If you possess the Telekinetic Push talent, you may spend a spell
      point to perform pushes as an immediate action.</p>

      <p>If you possess Kinetic Field, you may spend a spell point as a standard
      action to fold kinetic energy around yourself to create a catch field.
      This catch field moves with you and lasts 1 round per 3 caster levels
      (minimum 1). Once per round this stops a projectile aimed at you as if you
      were using Catch. You cannot have more than one use of this ability active
      at any one time.</p>
