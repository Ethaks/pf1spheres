      <p>You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that causes the
      target to contract a disease (Fortitude negates). The subject contracts
      one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle
      fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom.
      The disease is contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply).
      Use the disease&#8217;s listed frequency and save DC to determine further
      effects.</p>
