      <p>You may divine the emotions of creatures you can see within range (Will
      negates), and you gain a circumstance bonus to Sense Motive checks equal
      to 1/2 your caster level vs. creatures you have thus successfully divined.
      You do not know the motivation or source behind why a creature is feeling
      the emotion. If you spend an additional spell point, you divine not only
      the emotions of those within range, but also the surface thoughts (Will
      negates).</p>
