    value: >
      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, creating a cold, dry
      mountain wind to numb them. The target takes a 1d6 penalty to Dexterity,
      which increases by 1 at the beginning of each of its turns, to a maximum
      increase equal to half your caster level. This penalty cannot reduce a
      creature&#8217;s Dexterity below 1 and ends when this shroud does.</p>
