      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Curse (ghost strike)),
      caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When you successfully apply a curse through your Curse ghost strike,
      the DC to remove it is increased by +5. Additionally, you may apply much
      more powerful curses to the target, examples of which are outlined
      below:</p>

      <p><strong>Curse of Ages:</strong> The target ages 1 year every day.</p>

      <p><strong>Daybane:</strong> The target suffers 1d6 points of nonlethal
      damage for every minute of exposure to bright light, including daylight.
      This does not become lethal damage if the target falls unconscious.</p>

      <p><strong>Dayblind:</strong> The target is blind except in dim light or
      darkness.</p>

      <p><strong>Famine:</strong> Any food that the target attempts to consume
      instantly rots into a putrescent mass. The target can attempt a Fortitude
      save to choke down the spoiled food. If the target fails at the check, she
      takes 1d2 points of Constitution damage. In either case, attempting to
      consume food leaves the target sickened and unable to eat for 1d4 hours.
      Food created by magic can resist spoilage with a successful magic skill
      check against the DC of the curse.</p>

      <p><strong>Font of Truth:</strong> The target is unable to intentionally
      lie. In addition, anytime the target is asked a question, she must succeed
      at a Will save or answer in exacting, truthful detail. The target receives
      an additional save once per minute to cease elaborating upon her
      answer.</p>

      <p><strong>Insanity:</strong> The target gains either amnesia,
      mania/phobia, multiple personality disorder, paranoia, psychosis, or
      schizophrenia, as detailed in the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.</p>

      <p><strong>Lycanthropy:</strong> The target becomes afflicted with
      lycanthropy.</p>

      <p><strong>Ravenous:</strong> The target must attempt a Fortitude save
      every hour. If it fails, it must eat a full day&#8217;s worth of food. If
      sufficient food is not available, starvation advances at the rate of 1 day
      per failed Fortitude save.</p>

      <p><strong>Unluck:</strong> Once per hour, the target must reroll one roll
      (decided by the GM) and take the worse result.</p>

      <p><strong>Venerable:</strong> The target gains the penalties (but not the
      benefits) of advancing to the venerable age range. This does not actually
      increase their age.</p>

      <p><strong>Vulnerability:</strong> The target gains vulnerability to a
      single energy type. This has no effect on targets immune to the chosen
      energy type.</p>
