      <p>You can assist the recipient of your manabond in their spherecasting,
      or hamper their efforts. When creating this manabond, you can choose to
      apply either a penalty or a competence bonus to their caster level, but
      only for a single sphere, decided at the time of casting. This bonus or
      penalty begins at 1, and increases by 1 every eight caster levels you
      possess. The penalty cannot reduce a creature&#8217;s caster level below
      1.</p>
