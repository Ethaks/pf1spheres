    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to create an area of darkness that dims
      sound as well as light. Creatures within the area cannot speak or
      converse, and spells or magical sphere effects with verbal components
      suffer a 20% chance + 5% per caster level of spell failure. All Perception
      checks made to hear noises originating from within the area of your
      darkness suffer a penalty equal to your caster level. Creatures attempting
      to use sonic or language-based attacks, spells, or effects while within
      the area of this darkness or affecting creatures within the area of this
      darkness must attempt a magic skill check against this darkness as if the
      effect were a magical light effect; on a failure, the sonic or
      language-based effect fails.</p>
