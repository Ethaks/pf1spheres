      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>You may grant the target an aegis that makes them immune to ability
      damage and ability drain. This aegis does not remove ability damage or
      drain that the subject has already gained, but it does remove the
      penalties from ability damage or drain for the duration of this aegis.
      This aegis does not protect against self-inflicted ability damage or
      drain.</p>
