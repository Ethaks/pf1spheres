    value: >
      <p>Your Conjuration sphere companion is incapable of action without your
      direct control. You must spend an action for your companion to take the
      same action (swift for swift, standard for standard, etc.). A puppet
      companion may make attacks of opportunity by spending your attacks of
      opportunity if you have controlled it since the beginning of your last
      turn. Spending at least a move action this way counts as concentrating on
      the summon for that round. Any round you do not spend directing the
      companion, it stands mindlessly and counts as having the dazed condition.
      Your companion may still gain feats and skills (unless also possessing the
      mindless archetype); you may use the companion&#8217;s feats, skills,
      casting, and other abilities when directing the companion, though you may
      not use your own through the companion. Any effect that would possess or
      exercise mental control over a puppet companion (including enchantment
      charm effects and enchantment compulsion effects) requires a successful
      magical skill check against the summoner&#8217;s MSD. A puppet companion
      takes a -2 penalty on all rolls if it is outside of your close range. If
      you do not have line of sight to the puppet companion, it is treated as
      being blinded. Both these penalties are removed if you possess the Link
      talent.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may order a puppet companion to follow. Doing
      so causes the puppet to take move actions on its turn (including trading
      its standard action for a move action) to attempt to move adjacent to you
      (or as close as it is able) to the best of its ability. Should the
      companion be unable to find you (such as in a complex maze when you are
      out of sight for too long, if you are teleported out of view, etc.), the
      companion will remain in its current position. Taking any other action
      through the companion ends this ability. The spell point cost of summoning
      a puppet companion is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).</p>
