If you would enhance an object to trap an incorporeal creature, the creature may attempt a Reflex save to immediately move to the nearest unoccupied space outside the object (see Catches, Nets, and Cages in the Creation sphere, Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 254). The maximum sized object you can affect this way is given on Table: Spectral Enhancement.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may enhance a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or as many as 50 pieces of ammunition grouped together, granting it either the ghost touch special weapon ability or ghost touch special armor ability. If you spend an additional spell point, the enhanced equipment gains an additional benefit:</p>\n<p>If the enhanced equipment gains the ghost touch special weapon ability, the weapon becomes especially potent against undead and incorporeal creatures. Undead or incorporeal creatures damaged by the weapon must succeed at a Will saving throw or be sickened for 1 round, bypassing any immunity to the sickened condition the target may possess.</p>\n<p>If the enhanced equipment gains the ghost touch special armor ability, the armor grants the wearer energy resistance to negative energy equal to 1/2 your caster level and a circumstance bonus on saving throws against possession and negative energy effects equal to +2 + 1 per 5 caster levels you possess.</p>\n<strong>Table: Spectral Enhancement</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caster Level</th>\n<th>Size</th>\n<th>Sample Object</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>Candelabra</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>Chair</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Cage</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Statue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>Wagon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>Catapult</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>Ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Colossal+</td>\n<td>House</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>36</td>\n<td>Colossal++</td>\n<td>Warehouse</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>Colossal+++</td>\n<td>Cathedral</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
