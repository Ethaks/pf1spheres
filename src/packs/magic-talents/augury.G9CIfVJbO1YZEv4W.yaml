    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to divine whether a particular action will
      bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.</p>

      <p>The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster
      level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly.</p>

      <p>A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is
      automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury
      succeeds, you get one of four results:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</li>

      <li>Woe (for bad results).</li>

      <li>Weal and woe (for both).</li>

      <li>Nothing (for actions that do not have especially good or bad
      results).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If the check fails, you get the &#8220;nothing&#8221; result. A caster
      who gets the &#8220;nothing&#8221; result has no way to tell whether it
      was the consequence of a failed or successful augury.</p>

      <p>The augury can see into the future up to one hour per caster level, so
      anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus,
      the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a
      contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person, in the same day
      about the same topic, use the same die result as the first casting.</p>
