      <p>You may spend a spell point to rally a target, allowing them to attempt
      an Escape Artist check, draw a weapon, ready a shield, set a weapon
      against a charge, retrieve a stored item, stand-up from a prone position,
      or any other simple, non-offensive action the GM deems appropriate. The
      action is taken by the ally immediately as a free action and does not draw
      any attacks of opportunity.</p>
