      <p>You may repair any barrier you created (including those created using
      Greater Barrier) causing it to regain a number of hit points equal to
      twice your caster level. This is a move action, or you may spend a spell
      point to do this as a swift action. You must have line of sight to the
      barrier to use this talent.</p>

      <p>In addition, when you spend a spell point to maintain a barrier without
      concentration, you may spend an additional spell point to make it
      self-repairing. The barrier regains 1 hit point + 1 hit point per 2 caster
      levels at the start of each of your turns.</p>

      <p>A barrier that has been reduced to 0 hit points has been destroyed and
      cannot regain hit points or be restored using this talent.</p>

      <p>If used on a barrier comprised of cubes using the Shaped Ward talent,
      this talent allows each cube to regain 1 lost hit point or for 1 cube to
      regain all lost hit points when you spend a move action or a spell point
      and a swift action to use this ability. When you spend a spell point to
      maintain the barrier without concentration, you may spend an additional
      spell point to make each cube regain 1 hit point per round. A cube that
      has been reduced to 0 hit points has been destroyed and cannot regain hit
      points or be restored using this talent, though the remaining cubes can
      still regain hit points.</p>
