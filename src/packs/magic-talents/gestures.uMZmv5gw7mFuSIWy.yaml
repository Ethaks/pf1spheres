      <p>You mentally pull and tug at the target&#8217;s muscles and the aspects
      of its mind that relate to motor functions.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You influence the physical gestures made
      by a target and the actions of the target&#8217;s limbs and extremities
      (Will negates). You may impose a failure chance on any other magic user
      whose magic requires a somatic component equal to 10% + an additional 5%
      for every 5 caster levels (this effect stacks with similar failure
      chances, such as the arcane spell failure chance that accompanies
      armor).</p>

      <p>In addition, you may impose a circumstance penalty to any of the
      target&#8217;s skill checks that would ordinarily be subject to an armor
      check penalty equal to 2 + 1 per every 5 caster levels. This effect lasts
      for a number of minutes equal to your caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the
      lesser charm, you may enforce quick, shambling actions on the target or
      interruptions of actions the target is taking. You may force the target to
      pick up or drop an object in a space within its reach, although the target
      may only be forced to drop things that are held (as opposed to worn or
      bound in some way). As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity, you may make a flat-footed target fall prone, or otherwise
      make a ranged trip attempt against a target that uses your caster level in
      place of your base attack bonus and your casting ability modifier in place
      of your Strength modifier. If the target is flat-footed you may cause a
      check that would be affected by an armor check penalty to automatically
      fail. Finally, you may also prevent the usage of any magical ability that
      requires gestures or somatic components.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the
      lesser and greater charms, you gain nearly full control over the quick
      gestures and movements of the target. If your target threatens a square
      where another creature provokes an attack of opportunity, you may force
      the target to take an attack of opportunity against that target if they
      have any attacks of opportunity remaining (this counts as one of your
      attacks of opportunity).</p>

      <p>You may force the target to move up to half of its move speed in any
      direction that you wish. You may also use the target to provide the
      somatic components for your own magical effects, and even make the target
      the origin point of those effects so long as only somatic components are
      required. (Casters with the Utterances talent may include verbal
      components with no extra save required). You may also allow this magic to
      work in either direction, allowing a willing target to control you or vice
      versa (for example, a friendly rogue might pick a lock that only you can
      reach using your hands, or you might use your own painting skills to paint
      a picture through a friendly paladin&#8217;s hands to impress a
      dignitary).</p>
