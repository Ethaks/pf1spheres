      <p>When using a shroud, you may spend an additional spell point to affect
      additional creatures, up to 1 extra creature per 2 caster levels (minimum
      1). Every target must be affected by the same shroud. If you possess a
      mantle, you may likewise increase the number of targets you affect with
      your mantle, but the duration is reduced from 1 hour per caster level to
      10 minutes per caster level.</p>
