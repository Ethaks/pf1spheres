    value: >
      <p>When attempting to create a cage that occupies the same space as a
      creature, you may spend an additional spell point to create a full-body
      confinement cage. Treat a 1-inch thick cage created in this fashion as an
      object the same size as the creature. The target may still breathe and may
      still attempt Strength checks to escape, but are otherwise unable to
      attack the cage or take any action which requires physical movement. If
      spikes or harmful materials are applied to the inside of such a full-body
      confinement cage, the target suffers damage each round they remain inside
      the cage.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you may create non-harmful objects directly on a
      creature. An unwilling target is always entitled a Reflex save to avoid
      having an object created directly on them, causing the object to fall
      harmlessly to the ground. (For example, you may create manacles on a
      target&#8217;s wrists, but if they succeed at a Reflex save the manacles
      miss and fall to the ground.) When using this talent, create becomes
      subject to spell resistance.</p>
