      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mana sphere (Manathief (advanced,
      expunge), Gift Of Knowledge (manipulation)), caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>Your knowledge and experience in stealing the mana from others has
      pushed you to a new discovery; stealing their prowess in the magical arts.
      Whenever you successfully drain spell points from a target using
      Manathief, the target must additionally attempt a Will save, with a
      penalty to this save equal to the amount of spell points they lost from
      the triggering effect. On a failure, you steal the use of a single magic
      talent you are aware they can cast (or base sphere, if they possess a
      sphere with no additional talents invested). The target cannot use that
      sphere or talent until they rest to regain spell points, and you gain
      access to the talent stolen. If you do not possess the base sphere when
      stealing a talent this way, you instead only gain access to the base
      sphere. You retain use of it for 24 hours, however you may spend a spell
      point to retain it for another 24 hours, but each extra 24 hours adds a
      cumulative extra spell point cost to retaining the ability. You may only
      gain knowledge of one talent or sphere this way at a time, although you
      may choose to replace the talent you have retained an additional use of
      this talent.</p>

      <p>At caster level 10th, you may retain up to two talents at a time, and
      an additional talent every ten caster levels thereafter.</p>
