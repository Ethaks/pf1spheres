    value: >
      <p>As a standard action you may spend a spell point to touch a small
      container of liquid and instill a teleport or bend space that affects a
      single target inside it, which functions as a potion or oil. The instilled
      effect cannot have a trigger/normally require an immediate or readied
      action to activate, nor have a duration of concentration.</p>

      <p>An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell
      points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost
      of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not
      an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent
      and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the
      instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a
      single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single
      action.</p>
