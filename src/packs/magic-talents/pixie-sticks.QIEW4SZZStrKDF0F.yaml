      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Pixie Stick:</strong> For the duration of this fey-blessing,
      you form a mystical bond with any mostly-wooden weapon (such as a club,
      quarterstaff, or spear) you wield, or mostly-wooden ammunition such as an
      arrow or bolt from a ranged weapon you use. You gain a +1 insight bonus on
      attack and damage rolls when using such a weapon or ammunition. This bonus
      increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Stick Pixies:</strong> You may spend a spell point to summon a
      creature of the plant type with a CR of no greater than your caster
      level/3 as a 1-round action. A creature summoned this way gains the fey
      subtype, and is treated as a fey in addition to any other types it may
      possess. The creature appears within 30 feet of you and remains and serves
      you for the duration of your feylink. The creature obeys your commands,
      but unless you speak the creature&#8217;s language, or are able to speak
      with plants, only basic communication is possible (attacking an enemy,
      defending the caster, etc.).</p>

      <p>The total Hit Dice of plants called at one time cannot exceed your
      caster level (temporary increases to caster level such as the
      thaumaturge&#8217;s forbidden lore ability or implements of the Fallen Fey
      sphere do not increase this capacity nor the highest CR creature you may
      summon). Attempting to summon an additional plant forces you to dismiss a
      number of existing plants to bring the total under this limit. If a
      summoned creature expends abilities with a limited use, those abilities
      are expended for all creatures of the same kind. Likewise, a creature that
      gains immunity to an ability of a summoned creature gains immunity to that
      ability originating from all creatures of that type that you summon.</p>

      <p><strong>Sugar Sticks:</strong> You manifest a tube of sugary-sweet
      pixie dust for the duration of this fey-blessing. You may consume this
      pixie dust as a swift action, or feed to another willing creature as a
      standard action. Consuming the pixie dust restores 1 hit point per caster
      level. A creature cannot consume pixie dust more than once every 10
      minutes.</p>

      <p>The tube replenishes itself as a free action for the duration of the
      fey-blessing, then disappears when it ends. If the tube is not in your
      possession at the start of your turn, you can summon it to yourself as a
      move action as long as you have line of sight to it.</p>
