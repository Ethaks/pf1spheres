      "value": "<p>You may add the following traits to your forms. A single form cannot possess traits that grant opposed subtypes (for example, a target cannot possess both the Celestial Form and Fiendish Form traits), and some traits have specific requirements before they can be granted to a target.</p>\n<p><strong>Anarchic Form:</strong> The target gains the chaotic subtype, and gains a chaotic outsider&#8217;s aura for the purpose of detecting alignment. The target gains DR 2/lawful, which improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Axiomatic Form:</strong> The target gains the lawful subtype, and gains a lawful outsider&#8217;s aura for the purpose of detecting alignment. The target gains DR 2/chaos, which improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Celestial Form:</strong> The target gains the good subtype, and gains a good outsider&#8217;s aura for the purpose of detecting alignment. The target gains DR 2/evil, which improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Fiendish Form:</strong> The target gains the evil subtype, and gains an evil outsider&#8217;s aura of the purpose of detecting alignment. The target gains DR 2/good, which improves by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Angel Body:</strong> (Requires good subtype) The target gains a protective aura as a supernatural ability. The target and all creatures within 20 feet gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws, but only against attacks and effects that originate from evil creatures. These bonuses increase by +1 per 5 caster levels you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Daemon Body:</strong> (Requires evil subtype) The target festers with disease as a supernatural ability. Choose one natural attack the target possesses. When the target successfully strikes a creature with that natural attack, that creature must pass a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier) or be inflicted with the fleshweep disease (injury; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1 Con damage and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves).</p>\n<p><strong>Inevitable Body:</strong> (Requires lawful subtype) The target counts as both its own creature type and a construct, such as when determining what magic can affect it. The target gains a +2 racial bonus to all Fortitude saves, except against effects that also work on objects. This bonus increases by +1 per 5 caster levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Protean Body:</strong> (Requires chaotic subtype) The target becomes supernaturally resistant to blockage. The target gains a +2 racial bonus to all saving throws vs. paralysis and the entangled or stunned conditions. This bonus increases by +1 per 5 caster levels. The target also gains a racial bonus equal to 1/2 your caster level to Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple or pin.</p>\n",
