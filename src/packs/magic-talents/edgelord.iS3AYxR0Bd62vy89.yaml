    value: >
      <p>When the target is shrouded in an area of your darkness, their natural
      coolness is tastefully amplified. They gain a +1 bonus to Intimidate
      checks +1 per 5 caster levels, and may make Intimidate checks to
      demoralize an opponent as a move action instead of a standard action. At
      10 caster levels, the target may make an Intimidate check to demoralize as
      a swift action instead. This meld lasts for 1 hour per caster level and
      costs 1 spell point.</p>
