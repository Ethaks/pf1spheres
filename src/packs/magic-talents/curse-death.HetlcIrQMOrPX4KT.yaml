    value: >
      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to make a ghost strike that bestows a
      permanent curse on the target (Will negates). Curses may be removed with
      the Break Enchantment Life talent, rituals such as break enchantment or
      remove curse, wishes, upon your death, or by your choice as a free action,
      but otherwise cannot be dispelled.</p>

      <p>Choose one of the following curses to bestow upon the target:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The target suffers a -4 decrease to an ability score plus an
      additional -2 per 5 caster levels (minimum 1).</li>

      <li>The target suffers a -3 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws,
      ability checks, and skill checks plus an additional -1 per 5 caster
      levels.</li>

      <li>Each turn the target has a 25% chance to take no action. This chance
      increases by 5% per 2 caster levels (maximum 75%).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Curses do not stack with themselves, but a target can be afflicted by
      multiple different curses. With GM permission, you may invent your own
      curse, but it should be of equal power to those listed. The following
      effects would be considered appropriate:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Black Mark:</strong> The target is trailed by an unpleasant
      aura. The target takes a penalty on all Diplomacy and Handle Animal checks
      equal to 1/2 your caster level. All creatures begin with an attitude of
      unfriendly towards you (unless their attitude would start worse). Any
      animals the target interacts with react wildly, with prey animals running
      away and predator animals baring fangs or even attacking the target.
      [Gravecaller's HB]</li>

      <li><strong>Clumsy:</strong> The target cannot move faster than half their
      speed without an Acrobatics check vs. the curse&#8217;s DC. On a failure,
      the target falls prone.</li>

      <li><strong>Extreme Hunger:</strong> The target must eat and drink three
      times as much as normal every day or begin suffering from thirst and
      starvation.</li>

      <li><strong>Fumble:</strong> Anytime the victim picks up or retrieves an
      object (including drawing a weapon or ammunition), there is a 50% chance
      that he immediately drops it. If ammunition is dropped, the attack being
      made is lost. Any remaining attacks in a full attack action may still be
      attempted.</li>

      <li><strong>Greater Pain:</strong> Whenever the victim takes damage, he is
      staggered for 1 round.</li>

      <li><strong>Magically Conductive:</strong> When the victim is adjacent to
      the area of a damaging spell or spell-like effect, the area expands to
      include the victim.</li>

      <li><strong>Old Age:</strong> The target gains the penalties (but not the
      benefits) of advancing to the next age category. This does not actually
      increase their age.</li>

      <li><strong>Phobia:</strong> The target is cursed with a fear of a
      concept, chosen by the caster (such as crowds, spiders, rats, thunder,
      loud noises, etc.). Each round the target sees or hears a manifestation of
      its phobia (such as a spider, or an illusionary spider), the target must
      succeed at a Will save or be frightened for 1d4 rounds. A target cannot be
      frightened by the same phobia&#8217;s manifestation more than once per
      hour (such as the same spider, the same crowd, etc.) but new instances of
      the phobia work normally. GMs should determine if a phobia is appropriate
      by considering how frequently the target may encounter it. A phobia which
      would constantly trigger, such as a phobia towards &#8220;skin&#8221; or
      &#8220;all clothing&#8221;, would be more debilitating than the chance to
      take no action from the Curse (ghost strike)&#8217;s base options, and
      would not be appropriate. This curse is a mind-affecting effect.
      [Gravecaller's HB]</li>

      <li><strong>Repel Healing:</strong> The victim cannot heal naturally, and
      magical healing heals the victim by only half the usual amount (minimum 1
      point). Fast healing and regeneration are likewise halved.</li>

      <li><strong>Unfocused:</strong> The target suffers a penalty equal to your
      casting ability modifier to all skill checks governed by an attribute of
      your choice.</li>

      </ul>
