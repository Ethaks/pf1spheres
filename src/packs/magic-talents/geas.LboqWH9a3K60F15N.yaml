    value: >
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points and 10 minutes to place a geas on a
      touched target with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level. A geas is a
      magical command that compels the target to carry out some service or to
      refrain from some action or course of activity, as declared when the geas
      is placed. The target is allowed a Will save to negate this effect. While
      a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would
      result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of
      activity.</p>

      <p>The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas
      is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve
      some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own
      actions, the geas remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster
      level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p>

      <p>If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas for 24 hours, it
      takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2
      penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced
      to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24
      hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.</p>

      <p>A geas cannot be dispelled, but it may be broken through the Break
      Enchantment Life talent, as well spells such as break enchantment, limited
      wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish. You may remove a geas that you
      placed on a target as a standard action.</p>
