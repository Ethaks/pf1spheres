      <p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>

      <p><strong>Arboreal Pacifism:</strong> Creatures of the plant type will
      not attack you or allies within 30 feet of you unless compelled to do so
      by magical means. This effect is broken for a given creature if you or an
      ally attacks it.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant Empathy:</strong> You gain wild empathy as the druid
      class feature (and treating your caster levels as druid levels for this
      purpose), but only affecting creatures of the plant type and bypassing the
      immunity to mind-affecting effects granted by the plant type. This ability
      treats swarms of the plant type as if they were one creature possessing a
      single mind.</p>

      <p><strong>Wood Defense:</strong> You gain damage reduction equal to
      caster level against wood. This applies to weapons composed entirely of
      plant matter (staves, clubs, etc.), the natural attacks or creatures of
      the plant type, and magical effects manipulating or creating plants (the
      Pummel option of the (plant) package of the Nature sphere, the wall of
      thorns spell, etc.).</p>
