      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere (Spell Ward (aegis,
      ward)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Whenever you create a Spell Ward as an aegis or ward, you may spend an
      additional spell point to choose one sphere of magic plus an additional
      one for every 5 caster levels you possess. Those spheres of magic are the
      only spheres affected by your spell ward, with casters not having to make
      magical skill checks or roll to bypass spell resistance if they use
      abilities of any other sphere.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may choose to have your Spell Ward apply to all
      spheres except the chosen spheres or to have your Spell Ward apply only
      against spells from a specific source such as divine or arcane (see the
      High Magic Handbook pg. 17 for rules on distinct magic types). If you
      choose either of these options, this talent cannot be used with the
      Antimagic Aura talent. If two instances of Spell Selectivity would attempt
      to negate each other, the casters roll opposed magical skill checks, with
      the lower roller having their instance of the ability suppressed.</p>
