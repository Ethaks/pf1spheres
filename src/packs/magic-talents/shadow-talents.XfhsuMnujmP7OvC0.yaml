    value: >
      <p>Talents with the (shadow) tag manipulate a target&#8217;s own shadow
      directly, without manifesting an area of darkness at all. Unless otherwise
      indicated, a (shadow) talent may be applied to a target within medium
      range as a standard action. Only one (shadow) talent may be applied to any
      one target at a time, and an unwilling target is allowed a Will save to
      negate a shadow. The duration of each shadow is specified in its
      description. If a shadow can be maintained through concentration, you must
      remain within your shadow range of the target to do so.</p>

      <p>Shadows function normally within areas of glows, neither suppressing
      nor being suppressed by areas of glows simply by entering them. If a glow
      and shadow are cast directly upon the same target, however, the caster of
      the second effect must attempt a magic skill check against the MSD of the
      first effect&#8217;s caster. If the check succeeds, the second effect
      functions normally and the first effect is suppressed. Time spent
      suppressed counts against the duration of the effect in either case.</p>
