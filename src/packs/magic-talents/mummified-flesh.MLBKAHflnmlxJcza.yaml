      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Aridity of
      severity level 3 or higher, they gain DR 2/slashing and light
      fortification. The damage reduction increases by 1 for each severity level
      above 3. At severity level 4 they gain medium fortification and at
      severity level 7 they gain complete immunity to critical hits and
      precision damage.</p>
