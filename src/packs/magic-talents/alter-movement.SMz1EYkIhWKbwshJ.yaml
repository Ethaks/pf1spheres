    value: >
      <p>You may enhance creatures, increasing or decreasing their speed.</p>

      <p>When increasing, you grant the target a +10 feet enhancement bonus to
      one movement speed, as well as a +2 enhancement bonus to any Acrobatics,
      Climb, Fly, or Swim checks they might attempt while using that movement
      speed. These bonuses increase by +10 and +2, respectively, per 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>When decreasing a target&#8217;s movement, you halve all of the
      target&#8217;s movement speeds (minimum 5 feet). In addition, the target
      provokes an attack of opportunity whenever it makes a 5-foot step unless
      it succeeds at an Acrobatics check against your MSD.</p>
