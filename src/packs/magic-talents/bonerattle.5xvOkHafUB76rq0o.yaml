      <p>You may make a ghost strike that painfully contorts the target&#8217;s
      skeleton, exoskeleton, or body. The target suffers 1d6 + 1d6 per 3 caster
      levels damage and moves 5 feet + 5 feet per 10 caster levels into an
      unoccupied space of your choice (Fortitude partial; half damage and no
      forced movement). Forced movement from this effect does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity, and the target can only move into a space it could
      reach with its natural movement. The target receives a +4 bonus to their
      saving throw if you would move them into a location that is directly
      harmful to them (such as onto a bed of spikes, out of a window, etc.).</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point when using this ghost strike,
      the target is repeatedly wracked with pain for a short time. On a failed
      Fortitude saving throw against this ghost strike's initial effects, the
      target is afflicted for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your caster level
      (minimum 1). For the duration of this effect, the target suffers the
      effects of this ghost strike at the start of its turn, taking damage and
      being forced to move. The target is granted a new saving throw against
      this ghost strike to reduce its effects, but a successful saving throw
      does not end this ghost strike's duration.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> This ghost strike affects any creature with a
      skeleton, exoskeleton, or other similar body structure, bypassing any
      racial immunity to Fortitude saves or death effects the target may
      possess. Creatures without discernible anatomy are immune (such as
      elementals, oozes, or other appropriate creatures, usually those immune to
      critical hits or with the amorphous universal monster rule). At the
      GM&#8217;s discretion, creatures with reasonably discernable anatomy or
      body structures, such as a robot or construct whose inner gears and pieces
      may instead shake and rattle violently, can be affected by this ghost
      strike.</p>
