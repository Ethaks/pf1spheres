      "value": "<p>You know how to make many of your geomancing abilities particularly dangerous.</p>\n<p>When using the Freeze or Tremor geomancing abilities, you may cause the affected area to grow spike-like formations which last 1 round per caster level. If using Freeze on creatures, this affects the spaces adjacent to where they are standing. Freeze can&#8217;t create both spikes and slippery ice in the same space.</p>\n<p>Whenever a creature steps onto an affected square, make a touch attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack bonus. If successful, the target suffers piercing damage equal to your caster level (minimum 1) and has its land speed reduced by half due to its wounded feet. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the creature is treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of fast healing/magical healing/regeneration. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it enters the affected area. A creature may move at half speed through this area without risking damage to itself.</p>\n<p>When using Entangle you may cause the effect to grow thorns, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your caster level per round to all creatures inside the effect. Those who succeed at their Reflex save against the Entangle take half damage.</p>\n<p>When using Affect Fire or Create Fire, increase the space the fire occupies as if it were one size category larger than it actually is.</p>\n<p>Finally, when using Magnetize you may target a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area instead of a single target. When used in this way, Magnetize becomes a concentration effect. Any target who enters or begins their turn within this area is attacked by the metal object, as if using the Magnetize ability. These attacks are not attack actions. A single creature can only be attacked once per round in this way, no matter how many times they pass through the affected area during their movement. While this effect is active, attempting to grab or impede the Magnetized object requires a successful grapple (CMD equals 10 + your caster level + your casting ability modifier + any size benefit or penalty from the object).</p>\n",
