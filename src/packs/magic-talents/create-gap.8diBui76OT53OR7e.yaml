      <p>You bend space to create a gap in an otherwise solid object or wall. By
      spending a spell point, you can create a hole in an inanimate object up to
      a 5-foot cube in size plus an additional 5-foot cube per 4 caster levels
      placed in any configuration so long as it is contiguous. This hole does
      not damage the object or affect its structural integrity; since the
      created hole is formed of added space rather than removed space,
      everything in the affected area is still accessible, pushed to the nearest
      edge of the created gap. If the gap is created so that a creature would
      fall through it, they may make a Reflex save to safely move to the nearest
      edge of the hole. This hole lasts as long as you concentrate, though you
      may spend a spell point to allow a gap to remain for 1 minute per caster
      level without concentration.</p>

      <p><strong>Addendum:</strong> If a creature or object is inside an open
      space created through Create Gap when the effect expires, they are shunted
      into the nearest adjacent open space. If there is no such space adjacent
      to the terminated gap, the object takes 1d6 points of damage and is
      shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of
      where the gap was. If there is no free space within 100 feet, the target
      takes an additional 2d6 points of damage and is shunted to a free space
      within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, the target
      takes an additional 4d6 points of damage and is shunted to the nearest
      free space in any distance. [Apoc; SA: Battlefield Manipulation
