      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((fire) package, Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>\n<p>As a concentration effect, you may spend 2 spell points to call lava up from deep within the earth. This lava bursts from a 10 feet wide hole in the ground centered within range and creates a spout 10 feet high per 2 caster levels. Any creature in this area or who enters this area takes 10d6 points of fire damage and is hurled into the air and then tossed to the ground, suffering falling damage based upon the height of the volcanic spray (e.g., if the volcano is 80 feet tall, the creature takes 8d6 falling damage) and lands prone in a random square adjacent to the spout. A successful Reflex saving throw halves the fire damage and the creature is not tossed into the air, instead moving to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count toward the creature&#8217;s normal movement.</p>\n<p>In addition, the volcano sprays lava, smoke, and poison gas in a hemispherical emanation around itself. The radius of this emanation is equal to one half the volcano&#8217;s height (e.g., an 80 foot spout has a 40-foot radius emanation). All creatures within this area, including yourself, have concealment and suffer 2d6 points of fire damage each round as lava cascades on them.</p>\n<p>They also suffer 1d6 Constitution damage per round as they inhale poisonous gas (Fortitude DC 15 negates, the DC increases by 1 per previous save), as Vog severity level 7 from the Weather sphere. Even after a creature leaves the lava-filled area, they suffer 1d6 points of damage for 1d3 rounds as the lava already on them cools.</p>\n<p>A volcano must be created on the ground and cannot be created in other places, such as on the 2nd floor of a building. You can choose to make a smaller volcano than your level permits if an obstruction prevents it from reaching its full height, or if you simply want to create a spread of lava that&#8217;s smaller than your maximum.</p>\n",
