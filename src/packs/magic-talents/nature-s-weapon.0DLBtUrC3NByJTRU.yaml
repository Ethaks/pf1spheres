      <p>You may perform one of the following special attacks or gain one of the
      following benefits. In addition to the effects that already possess a
      duration, if you possess the ability to grant (spirit) talent abilities to
      another you may spend a spell point as a standard action to grant a target
      the ability to use one of these attacks for 1 round per caster level. The
      options available are dependent on your Nature packages, as outlined
      below:</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Cacophony:</strong> As a standard action you may create a
      torrent of wind that deals sonic damage equal to 1d4 + 1 per caster level
      to all creatures and unattended objects within a cone that reaches from
      you to the edge of your geomancing range. Any creature damaged by the
      effect must succeed at a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Stone Fist:</strong> As a free action you may encase one
      or both of your fists with stone for 1 round. While so encased, you cannot
      hold anything in that hand and suffer a -2 armor check penalty. You also
      are considered armed when making unarmed strikes with that hand, gain a +1
      shield bonus to AC, and your unarmed strikes with that hand deal 1d6
      damage Medium (1d4 Small) and ignore hardness less than 8. This damage
      increases by 1 die size (1d8, 1d10, 2d6, 2d8, etc.) every 4 caster levels
      you possess, and the shield bonus increases by 1 for every 6 caster levels
      you possess. This does not stack with monk levels or other effects that
      increase the damage of unarmed strikes.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire: Fire Wielder:</strong> As a free action you may create a
      fire in one or both of your hands. You are considered armed with this
      fire, and can treat it as a light weapon when making attacks. Attacks with
      this flame are touch attacks, and deal fire damage equal to the largest
      fire you can create with Create Fire. This fire cannot be augmented like a
      normal fire, and attacks with this fire are not augmented by your Strength
      modifier or effects that increase physical damage such as Power Attack, as
      flame is immaterial. You cannot be disarmed of this fire, but you may
      throw it as a ranged weapon attack with no range penalty to a maximum of
      your geomancing range.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal: Blade Whip:</strong> As a standard action you may
      reshape a mostly metal weapon (such as a sword or battleaxe) you are
      wielding into a cable and perform a trip, disarm or sunder combat maneuver
      against a target within your geomancing range. This is considered a ranged
      attack, and you cannot be targeted in return on a failure. You gain a
      bonus to the check equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). After the
      combat maneuver check has been resolved, your weapon returns to its
      original form.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Bramble Strike:</strong> You may spend a spell point as
      a standard action to cause brambles to burst from any mostly wooden weapon
      (such as a club, quarterstaff, or spear) you are wielding, or pieces of
      mostly-wooden ammunition such as an arrow or bolt coming from a ranged
      weapon you are using, for 1 round per caster level. Once per round when
      you strike a creature with one of your qualifying weapons, you may cause
      them to attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, the target becomes entangled
      for 1 round. For every 10 caster levels you possess, you may use this
      ability an additional time per round. Escaping this entanglement follows
      the same rules as escaping from the Entangle geomancing ability. If a
      creature fails their saving throw while already entangled from this
      effect, the condition&#8217;s duration increases by 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Icicles:</strong> You may spontaneously create an icicle
      in your hand as a free action. These icicles count as masterwork daggers
      and melt if they leave your hand for more than 1 round. These icicles gain
      a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels you possess (maximum +5) and
      deal an amount of extra cold damage equal to 1/2 your caster level.</p>
