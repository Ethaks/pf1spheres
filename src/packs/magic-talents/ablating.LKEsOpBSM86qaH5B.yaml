      <p>You may create an aegis that has a chance of negating attacks against
      the protected creature. When created, the aegis has an ablation rate of
      20% + 5% for every 3 caster levels, maximum 50%. The aegis acts as a miss
      chance equal to its ablation rate against attacks, and whenever the
      protected creature is missed due to miss chance, its ablation rate drops
      by 5%. When the ablation rate becomes equal to or less than 0, the aegis
      ends, even if the duration has not yet expired. If the character has a
      miss chance from another source, only the highest miss chance applies, and
      the aegis is only reduced if its ablation rate is higher than all other
      miss chances.</p>
