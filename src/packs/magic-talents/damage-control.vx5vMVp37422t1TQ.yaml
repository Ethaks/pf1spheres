    value: >
      <p>You may choose to have all damage dealt by a destructive blast be
      nonlethal damage. Damage dealt is calculated as if the destructive blast
      was its original damage type as well as nonlethal (for example, an acid
      blast would still be subject to acid resistance), but the resulting damage
      is added to the target&#8217;s nonlethal damage total and not subtracted
      from their hit points. When using a (blast type) talent that already deals
      nonlethal damage, your destructive blast damage increases by +1 damage per
      die.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may choose to deal no damage at all, only inflicting
      secondary effects, such as from (blast type) talents, or only expressing
      minor, controlled effects of the damage type you would normally deal with
      your destructive blast. For example, you might create a spark with a Fire
      Blast, drive a nail into wood with the bludgeoning force of a standard
      destructive blast, or make an indistinct sound with a Thunder Blast. These
      effects should never be powerful, and the GM is the final arbiter of what
      can be accomplished this way.</p>
