      "value": "<p>You may alter an object&#8217;s size for 1 minute per caster level. When using alter you may cause any object you may affect to increase or decrease by 1 size category. This doubles or halves the object&#8217;s height and width and multiplies or divides its weight by 8.</p>\n<p>By spending a spell point, you can increase the number of steps you may enlarge or shrink an object by 1 + 1 per 5 caster levels (to a maximum of Colossal and a minimum of Fine). Effects which depend upon a target object&#8217;s size which would not function due to size alterations are automatically suppressed, continuing to count down their duration as normal, when the object no longer meets the size requirements.</p>\n<p>Worn items affected by Magnify/Minimize impede their wearer. Magical armor and clothing made too large or small make movement difficult and treat the wearer as if they were encumbered with a heavy load. Non-magical worn equipment made too small forces the wearer to attempt a Strength check (with a +2 bonus per size category change of the equipment) against the Break DC of the object. Success destroys the object while failure results in encumbrance as if it was a magical item. Non-magical equipment made too large may encumber the target or simply fall to the ground if made 2 or more sizes too large. Other effects of similar severity may occur at the GM&#8217;s discretion.</p>\n<p>If cast on a qualifying creature using Potent Alteration, the target creature gains the same adjustments as if the Size Change Alteration talent had been used on them to adjust them to the target size.</p>\n",
