      <p>When you create Fog, you may add one of the following additional
      effects depending on what other packages you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Wind Blades:</strong> Your fog attacks those inside it
      with blades of wind. Any creature or object moving through this fog must
      succeed at a Reflex save or suffer 1d6 + 1 per 2 caster levels points of
      slashing damage for every 5 feet of movement spent entering or moving
      through this fog.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Sandstorm:</strong> Requires loose dirt or sand instead
      of water. You create a sandstorm. In addition to the fog, this also
      functions as a Vortex, except it travels over land and extends into the
      air, and can even leave the ground and travel in the air. The obscuring
      effect only applies to the actual area of the vortex, and creatures that
      possess earthsight or tremorsense do not have their vision obscured by
      this effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire: Smokescreen:</strong> Requires fire instead of water. You
      may create a fog out of smoke instead of mist. Creatures that begin their
      turn within or enter the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or become
      blinded for 1 minute. In addition, creatures suffer &#8211;2 penalty on
      attack rolls and Perception checks for as long as they remain inside and
      for 1 round after exiting the smoke. Creatures that possess firesight do
      not have their vision obscured by clouds modified with this effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal: Acid Rain:</strong> You may spend an additional spell
      point to create acid rain. An acid fog deals 1d6 acid damage per 2 caster
      levels (minimum 1d6, no save) to creatures inside it. This fog deals
      damage when you first create it and each subsequent round at the beginning
      of your turn. Any creature who enters the cloud immediately suffers
      damage, but only once even if they leave and re-enter the cloud as part of
      their movement. Creatures that possess metalsight do not have their vision
      obscured by this effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Spore Cloud:</strong> Requires grass, weeds, or trees
      instead of water. You may create a cloud of spores. Creatures that begin
      their turn within or enter the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or
      become sickened for as long as they remain within the fog + 1d6 rounds
      after leaving. If a creature fails its Fortitude save against this effect
      while already sickened, it also becomes nauseated for 1 round. Creatures
      and objects that exit the cloud are covered in visible sticky spores that
      remain until removed as a full-round action; outlining their form and
      revealing their position, and making invisibility impossible without first
      cleaning off the spores. Creatures that possess greensight or plantsight
      do not have their vision obscured by this effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Solid Fog:</strong> You may make your fog so thick that
      it becomes effectively solid. Creatures move at half their speed through
      the fog, cannot make 5-foot steps, and suffer a -1 penalty to all weapon
      attacks and damage rolls made within or that pass through this area -1 per
      10 caster levels. Objects that fall within this area are slowed so that
      each 10 feet of fog reduces the falling damage by 1d6, +1d6 per 10 caster
      levels.</p>
