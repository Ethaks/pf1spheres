      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fallen Fey sphere, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>You can flood the lungs of a willing, helpless, or fascinated creature
      by touching it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the lips) as a
      standard action. If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its
      breath and immediately begins to drown.</p>

      <p>On its turn, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to cough up this
      water; otherwise it falls unconscious at 0 hit points. On the next round,
      the target must save again or drop to &#8211;1 hit points and be dying; on
      the third round it must save again or die. Succeeding at any of these
      Fortitude saves causes the target to cough up the water and no longer be
      drowning, ending the effect. Activating this fey-blessing costs an
      additional spell point.</p>
