      <p>As a swift action made as part of successfully using an expunge or
      (manipulation) that targets a creature other than yourself, or as a move
      action made by spending a spell point to touch a creature other than
      yourself, you can create a manabond between yourself and the targeted
      creature for as long as you concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per
      caster level. Concentration on a manabond only requires a swift action,
      with the action required being unable to be lowered by any means other
      than the Magical Conduit talent. When creating a manabond, you may add a
      single (manabond) talent that you possess to the effect.</p>

      <p>A manabond is a direct, invisible and intangible line of energy that
      connects you and your target, and remains active up to close range, beyond
      which the manabond breaks, and the effect ends. As long as you have a
      manabond with a creature, you may always pinpoint their exact location
      (although this does not negate any concealment they may have).</p>

      <p>When creating a manabond, you are considered the host of the manabond,
      with the targeted creature considered the recipient. A creature can only
      be the host of a single manabond, and cannot be the recipient of multiple
      manabonds at the same time. If a second manabond would be cast on a
      creature, the caster must attempt a magic skill check against the MSD of
      the currently active manabond on the target. If the caster succeeds, the
      other manabond is suppressed, causing it to remain active and ongoing as
      long as it is maintained, but having no effect on the recipient until the
      suppressing manabond has ended.</p>

      <p>If the caster fails, their manabond becomes suppressed, with the
      original manabond remaining active. Even when suppressed, a host may still
      pinpoint the location of the recipient.</p>

      <p>When you gain the Mana sphere, you gain the following (manabond)
      talent:</p>
