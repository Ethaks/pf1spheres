    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to enhance an animal, plant, object, or
      mindless creature, granting it temporary intelligence. The target becomes
      a magical creature (or intelligent item if an object), and gains an
      Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom score of 6 + 1/2 your caster level (or
      its original score, whichever is higher), as well as an alignment equal to
      your own, and the ability to speak and understand one language of your
      choice which you also speak and understand, +1 language you know per point
      of Intelligence bonus. It also gains normal senses to 60 feet if it did
      not previously possess any. However, temporary minds do not grant skill
      points or feats, nor the ability to move. However, a target with a
      bestowed mind no longer counts as mindless for purposes such as
      immunities.</p>

      <p>For the most part, the new mind has a beginning disposition of friendly
      towards you, unless the creature already had a different disposition (for
      example, a hostile creature would still be hostile). The target does not
      gain greater insight into its surroundings before it gained intelligence
      (thus, an intelligent rock could not tell you who passed by it before it
      gained sentience, nor an intelligent tree describe a creature who climbed
      it the day before), nor does it automatically obey your commands, although
      it will usually provide favors and aid that is not too dangerous. Mindless
      creatures must attempt a Will saving throw against this effect unless it
      is a creature already under your control, such as an animated object or
      undead minion.</p>

      <p>When bestowing a mind onto a creature under your control, it still
      continue to obey you explicitly even though it is now intelligent.</p>
