      <p>You may enhance a melee weapon, granting it the throwing and returning
      weapon special abilities.</p>

      <p>When used on a ranged weapon, a throwing weapon, or a weapon that
      already possesses the throwing special ability, this instead gives the
      weapon or its ammunition the ability to curve slightly; ranged attacks
      with that weapon ignore 2 points of the AC bonus from cover less than
      total cover, +2 points per 7 caster levels.</p>
