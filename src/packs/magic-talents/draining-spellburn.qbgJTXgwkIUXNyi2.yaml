      <p>When you utilize your Spellburn expunge ability, you may cause the
      spell points burned to be treated as if the spellcaster had spent them
      normally (if a caster level is required, use your caster level), causing
      them to trigger effects that occur when they spend spell points such as
      certain Mark talents, drawbacks or similar abilities.</p>
