      "value": "<p>You may spend a spell point to enhance an item or creature, reducing its weight or even making it weightless. The maximum sized object you can affect is given on Table: Lighten Object.</p>\n<p>An enhanced object weighs half as much as normal, but if you choose, you may make objects up to one size category smaller than your limit completely weightless, or up to 2 size categories smaller float up or down as you choose at a rate of 20 feet per round. While you cannot make an object or creature move any direction other than up or down, this can easily be combined with telekinesis, wind power, or pushing off a wall (at half the target&#8217;s usual speed) to create flight-like effects. Unwilling creatures are allowed a new saving throw each round to negate this effect, but they may suffer falling damage if successful.</p>\n<p>When determining things such as penalties for using oversized weapons, damage dealt from dropping an object like an indirect siege engine, affecting an object with telekinesis, etc., a 1/2 weight object counts as being one size category smaller and a weightless object counts as being two size categories smaller. 1/2-weight creatures suffer a -2 penalty to their CMD vs. bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers, and 1/2-weight armor has its spell failure chance decreased by 5%, its max Dexterity bonus increased by 1, and its armor check penalty decreased by 1 (minimum 0). Weightless or floating creatures/armor double these bonuses/penalties. Additionally, a levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.</p>\n<p>Creatures floating above the ground cannot use a land speed to move without a wall or some other method of pushing themselves horizontally.</p>\n<strong>Table: Lighten Object</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caster Level</th>\n<th>Tiny</th>\n<th>Small</th>\n<th>Medium</th>\n<th>Large</th>\n<th>Huge</th>\n<th>Gargantuan</th>\n<th>Colossal</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Weightless</td>\n<td>1/2 weight</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Weightless</td>\n<td>1/2 weight</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Weightless</td>\n<td>1/2 weight</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Weightless</td>\n<td>1/2 weight</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Weightless</td>\n<td>1/2 weight</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Weightless</td>\n<td>1/2 weight</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Weightless</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n<td>Float</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
