    value: >
      <p>By spending an additional spell point at the time you create an
      illusion, you may designate any number of targets to be immune to the
      illusion. This allows you to, once per round per illusion as a free
      action, allow any number of targets to be treated as automatically
      disbelieving the illusion or completely suppress the effect without ending
      it (but must still concentrate if the effect is being maintained via
      concentration). While this allows the creature to be treated as if they
      disbelieved the illusion, this does not actually force them to gain
      knowledge of the illusion.</p>

      <p><em>Example 1:</em> When under the effects of Suppression or an
      Illusionary Disguise, you may allow your allies to see you as if you had
      no concealment or disguise while still maintaining the effect against
      everyone else.</p>

      <p><em>Example 2:</em> When creating a figment of a tree, you could
      designate a creature with greensight to &#8216;disbelieve&#8217; the
      illusion, allowing them to see through the tree just as they normally
      would be able to.</p>

      <p>Anyone you designate as unaffected is still aware of the effect just as
      if they had disbelieved it, allowing them to appropriately react in the
      case of a ruse or the need to make tactical decisions. Illusions that have
      effects regardless of belief or disbelief, such as a shadow illusion,
      still have their effects unless you opt to suppress them. Suppressing and
      reactivating an illusion does not force those whom already successfully
      disbelieved the illusion to re-roll their saves.</p>
