      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Teleport Object), caster
      level 5th.</p>

      <p>You can teleport objects of much greater weight and size, even whole
      vehicles and structures. You may teleport any object of appropriate size,
      shown on the Structure Table below. If you use Mass Teleport in
      conjunction with this talent, a teleported object counts as a creature in
      the affected group for the purposes of who may be included within the Mass
      Teleport.</p>

      <p>If you use Group Teleport in conjunction with this talent, you may
      teleport all targets touching a teleported object or structure instead of
      teleporting all creatures within Ranged Warp range. You must use Unwilling
      Teleport to teleport any unwilling creatures on the object or
      structure.</p>

      <h5 id="toc59"><span>Warping Structures (Store and Teleport
      Structure)</span></h5>

      <p>A vehicle or building that is occupied is counted as attended or in a
      creature's possession, preventing it from being teleported or stored
      unless all occupying creatures are willing and/or helpless, or targeted
      with Unwilling Teleport.</p>

      <p>Some large structures, such as a castle, are arguably made up of a
      multitude of smaller structures, but can be counted as a single structure
      for this purpose as long as they are conceptually a single unit.</p>

      <p>Finally, the contents of a structure are moved with it as if they were
      part of the object, so long as the contents can fit comfortably inside
      (this, hay inside a wagon would work, but an enormous dragon's corpse
      across the top would not).</p>
