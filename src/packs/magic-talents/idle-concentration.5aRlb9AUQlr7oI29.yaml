      <p>You may choose to maintain concentration on your telekinesis as a swift
      action. However, targets of your telekinesis remain motionless while you
      concentrate on them this way, hovering in place. You cannot move them, use
      them to Bludgeon, or direct them to perform tasks. Dancing weapons that
      hover do not threaten their range or provide flanking bonuses, and you may
      not apply the benefits of Telekinetic Crush to hovering targets.</p>

      <p>This talent cannot be used to concentrate on a Hostile Lift or Kinetic
      Field.</p>
