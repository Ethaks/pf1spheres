      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a consecration that lets you
      manipulate luck and fate. For as long as this consecration is in effect,
      any creature within the area who rolls a 10 on an attack roll, initiative
      roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw receives either a +10
      luck bonus or a -10 penalty to their roll (your choice). This bonus and
      penalty increase by 1 per 2 caster levels, and do not apply when the
      creature takes 10; only a d20 roll will do. Additionally, once per round
      any time a creature within the area rolls a natural 1 or natural 20, you
      may change the roll into the opposite. This does not require an action,
      but may only be used once per round. Converting a natural 20 to a natural
      1 is a curse effect and may be negated with a successful Will save. You
      must concentrate to maintain this consecration, but you may spend a spell
      point as a free action to allow this effect to continue for 1 round per
      caster level without concentration.</p>
