      <p>As a manabond, you can create a connection between yourself and another
      creature that confounds targeted magical effects. As long as the manabond
      holds, any time you or the recipient is targeted by a single-targeted
      sphere effect that requires a Fortitude or Will save, or any harmless
      effect, you may redirect such an effect to yourself or the recipient as an
      immediate action. If the recipient is unwilling to have the magical effect
      redirected to or away from them, they may attempt a Will save to stop the
      effect from being redirected. In addition, when you or a willing recipient
      is targeted by a single-targeted harmless effect, you may instead have it
      affect the other creature as a free action that can be taken outside of
      your turn. The redirected sphere effect can be redirected multiple times
      across multiple willing recipients, so long as all creatures affected have
      a manabond of this type linking them.</p>
