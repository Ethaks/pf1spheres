      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a totem of screaming skin.
      Enemies within this are haunted by the sensation of pain from far away.
      Whenever their skin is even slightly broken, a wound rips open in the
      shape of a mouth and screams, making even the smallest injuries horrific.
      Whenever a weapon or natural weapon attack is made on an enemy inside the
      totem, if the attack roll misses by 5 or less, and is not a natural 1, the
      attack is a glancing blow and does damage equal to your caster level.
      Effects that trigger on a hit, such as a melee touch attack delivering a
      sphere ability, do not trigger on a glancing blow.</p>
