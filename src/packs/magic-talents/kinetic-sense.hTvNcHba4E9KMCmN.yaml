      <p>You no longer need line of sight to use telekinesis on an object or
      creature, as long as you target the correct space the target is in. If you
      target an incorrect square your action is wasted, though you retain any
      spell points you would have spent.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may spend a spell point to gain 30 feet blindsense for
      one minute per caster level.</p>
