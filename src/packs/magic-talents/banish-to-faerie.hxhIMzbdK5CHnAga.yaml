      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 8th caster or higher.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to make a melee touch
      attack against a creature and hurl it into Faerie. This provokes an attack
      of opportunity. A successful Will save negates this ability. Once within
      Faerie, if the target creature wishes to return to where it previously
      was, it must travel 1d12 miles to reach a fairy circle and find a way
      through, arriving within 1d6 miles of its former location. This is a
      teleportation effect.</p>
