      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Acidic Creation
      (material)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may create and animate an ooze creature. You must spend an
      additional spell point for every 4 Hit Dice of the desired ooze; you
      cannot create an ooze with more Hit Dice than your caster level or that is
      larger than you can create. The magic behind the ooze&#8217;s creation
      allows it to recognize you as its creator and obey basic commands such as
      &#8220;attack&#8221;, &#8220;defend&#8221;, or &#8220;move&#8221; and to
      follow them to the best of its ability, but it otherwise is a normal,
      mindless member of its kind and will act appropriately.</p>

      <p>This ooze may be any un-templated creature of the ooze type or a unique
      creation subject to GM discretion. You may not control more Hit Dice of
      ooze than your caster level; if you create more than this, the
      earliest-created oozes no longer recognize you as their creator until you
      are under this limit again. Oozes can be made permanent through the Create
      Materials advanced talent.</p>
