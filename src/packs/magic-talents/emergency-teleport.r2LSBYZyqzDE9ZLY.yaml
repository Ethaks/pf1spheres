    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to perform a teleport as an immediate
      action. The range is decreased to 5 feet per 2 caster levels (minimum 5
      feet) and cannot be coupled with talents that would increase its range. If
      used to avoid an attack or area effect (or to move the attacker), this
      grants the defender evasion and a dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves equal
      to half your caster level (minimum 1). You cannot touch a target as part
      of this teleport, but you may affect another creature if you are already
      touching them.</p>
