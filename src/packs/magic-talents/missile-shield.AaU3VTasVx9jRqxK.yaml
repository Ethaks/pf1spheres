      <p>You may create a ward that protects creatures within from projectiles,
      including projectile weapons, thrown rocks, rays made up of projectiles
      (such as created by the Stone Blast talent of the Destruction sphere) or
      falling debris. Any damage of that type dealt within this area is reduced
      by 5 + your caster level. These effects only absorb damage and may not
      protect from other side effects of an attack (like being pinned under the
      weight of a thrown boulder or being poisoned by a poisoned arrow).</p>
