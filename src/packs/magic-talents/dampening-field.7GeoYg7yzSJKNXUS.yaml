    value: >
      <p>You may use your telekinetic force to protect and stabilize creatures
      and objects that you are lifting.</p>

      <p>When lifting an object with your telekinesis, you may grant it a +1
      bonus to hardness and a +1 deflection bonus to AC, +1 per 5 caster levels,
      and cause it to take no penalties from the broken condition.</p>

      <p>When lifting a creature with your telekinesis, you may grant it
      DR/piercing equal to 1/2 your caster level. When using a creature or
      object as a Bludgeon, you may choose for the object itself to not suffer
      damage from being used as a Bludgeon.</p>

      <p>You may grant these benefits as part of a Sustained Force, as part of
      or independent of any actual telekinetic movement.</p>
