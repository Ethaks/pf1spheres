      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Enduring Portal, Mass
      Teleport [mass], Portal (advanced), Teleport Beacon (space), Unwilling
      Teleport, Wormhole (space)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>When you or another target enters a portal, you may cause it to exit
      from any portal that you have created that currently exists rather than
      just the portal&#8217;s original destination. Alternatively, you may allow
      a creature that enters one of your portals to choose which portal they
      exit from. You are aware of any creature that enters a portal you have
      created.</p>
