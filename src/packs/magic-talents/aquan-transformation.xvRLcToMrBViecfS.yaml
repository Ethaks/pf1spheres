      <p>You grant the form of a swimming animal or magical beast with your
      shapeshift.<br>

      <strong>Limbs:</strong> 1 head, tail<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> No; <strong>Hands:</strong> No<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 5 ft. land speed, 40 ft. swim speed. The swim
      speed increases by +20 ft. per 5 caster levels.<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> bite (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft., the aquatic subtype (allowing
      the target to breathe water). If the target can breathe air normally, it
      also gains the amphibious special ability, and can breathe both water and
      air.</p>

      <p>Aquan Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply
      to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The shapeshifted target gains a swim
      speed as that granted by Aquan Transformation. In addition, the target
      gains the aquatic subtype and amphibious special quality, allowing the
      target to breathe both water and air.</li>

      <li><strong>Aquatic Tail:</strong> The shapeshifted target gains a tail
      and a circumstance bonus on Swim checks equal to +1 + 1 per 5 caster
      levels. In addition, the shapeshifted target may use this tail to create a
      sudden riptide while underwater. As a standard action the shapeshifted
      target can create a 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels cone. Creatures
      in the cone&#8217;s area take 2d6 + 1d6 per 5 caster levels nonlethal
      bludgeoning damage and are pushed 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels
      directly away from the shapeshifted target (Reflex negates; DC equal to
      the caster&#8217;s Alteration sphere DC plus the circumstance bonus on
      Swim checks granted by this trait). This cone can extend onto land,
      extending 5 feet for every 10 feet in the water. Creatures on land fall
      prone on a failed Reflex save instead of being moved back. The
      shapeshifted target must wait 1d4 rounds between uses of this ability.
      <strong>Special:</strong> When granting this trait, you may choose to have
      this tail replace the shapeshifted target&#8217;s legs. If you do, the
      shapeshifted target&#8217;s base land speed is reduced to 5 feet and the
      target cannot be tripped. In addition, the shapeshifted target gains a 30
      feet swim speed or increases their existing swim speed by +15 feet
      (whichever is more beneficial). If the shapeshifted target gains legs
      through another ability or Alteration sphere trait, such as the Additional
      Limbs &#8220;a pair of legs&#8221; trait, the shapeshifted target loses
      any benefits or adjustments from replacing their legs with this tail.</li>

      <li><strong>Blindsense</strong> 30 feet (only in water)</li>

      <li><strong>Ink Jet:</strong> Once per minute, the target may shoot a jet
      of ink as a standard action. In water, this creates a 10-foot radius
      sphere that provides total concealment and persists for 1 minute. On land,
      this is a ranged touch attack with a 10-foot range increment and a maximum
      range of 50 feet that forces a struck creature to succeed at a Reflex save
      (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier) or be blinded for 1d6
      rounds or until they spend a standard action removing the ink from their
      eyes.</li>

      <li><strong>Jet:</strong> The target can swim backwards as a full-round
      action at four times their swim speed. It must move in a straight line
      while jetting, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it does
      so. This trait requires a swim speed.</li>

      <li><strong>Keen Scent:</strong> The target gains the keen scent universal
      monster ability.</li>

      <li><strong>Shock:</strong> As a standard action, the target may deal 1d8
      + 1d8 per odd caster level electricity damage with a melee touch attack.
      This touch attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If a creature
      successfully grapples the target, the target may use this ability as an
      immediate action, inflicting the damage with no attack roll, but allowing
      a Fortitude saving throw for half damage. If the target is in water, this
      ability instead functions as a 10-foot radius burst centered on the
      target; affected creatures are allowed a Fortitude saving throw for half
      damage. Creatures beyond 10 feet but within a 30-foot radius takes half
      damage, with a Fortitude save for half damage. Once used, this ability
      cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.</li>
