      <p>Cold environments can deal either lethal or nonlethal cold damage to a
      creature. A creature dealt damage in this manner becomes fatigued
      (frostbitten), and cannot recover from fatigue or damage until warmed up.
      If a character takes an amount of nonlethal cold damage equal to her total
      hit points, any further damage from a cold environment is lethal cold
      damage.</p>

      <p>Characters wearing a cold weather suit treat the Cold as if it were 1
      level lower in severity, and may use the Survival skill to gain bonuses to
      saving throws against Cold. A large fire can be used to create an area of
      warmth in a cold environment. Cold deals damage according to Table:
      Cold.</p>
