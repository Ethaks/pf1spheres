    value: >
      <p>Wards you create may be completely sealed spheres. If creating the ward
      would cause it to go through another object, the ward cuts harmlessly
      through the material and affecting targets on the far side (without
      compromising the integrity of the object, but preventing the object from
      being moved in the case of a barrier). If creating the ward would cause a
      physical manifestation such as a barrier to go through a creature or
      animated object, the ward shunts the creature just outside the effect of
      the sphere.</p>

      <p>These modifications to your wards make it so that ethereal creatures,
      or creatures with unusual movement modes such as burrow cannot pass
      through a barrier by going around the ward, but must instead destroy the
      barrier to enter or exit. This ability can be combined with Greater
      Barrier to allow your barrier wall to pass through objects.</p>

      <p>This talent replaces Continuous Barrier.</p>
