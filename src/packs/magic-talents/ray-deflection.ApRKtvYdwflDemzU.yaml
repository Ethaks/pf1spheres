    value: >
      <p>Whenever a ray attack is used against a creature with this aegis, there
      is a 20% chance the ray will be deflected back at the caster. This
      increases by 5% for every 5 caster levels to a maximum of 50%. This aegis
      does not offer protection against rays that automatically hit, such as
      those with a natural 20 on the attack roll. A deflected ray makes an
      attack against the attacker using the same attack roll and all of the
      applicable modifiers of the original attack and if it hits, the attacker
      takes the attack&#8217;s damage and suffers all the other consequences of
      getting struck with that attack.</p>
