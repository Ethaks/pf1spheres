      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Life sphere (Break Enchantment, Greater
      Resurrection (advanced), Make Whole (advanced), Restore Senses (cure),
      Restore Spirit (cure), Resurrection (advanced), Resuscitate), caster level
      20th.</p>

      <p>When you bring a target back to life with your Resurrection talent,
      they suffer no permanent negative levels, in addition to having all
      ability score damage and drain completely removed.</p>

      <p>You may also resurrect creatures whose bodies have been destroyed
      completely, provided that you may specifically identify the deceased in
      some fashion. Additionally, you may spend an additional 2 spell points to
      also allow the Resurrection to count as using a miracle or wish spell for
      creatures that require such an effect to be resurrected, in addition to
      being able to resurrect creatures regardless of how long they have been
      dead for.</p>
