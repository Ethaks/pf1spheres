      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Extradimensional Storage
      (space)), caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point you can touch an object to place it in your
      extradimensional storage, even if it would normally be too large or dense.
      Objects stored this way do not count against the weight limit of your
      storage, but are limited by size; you may store objects whose combined
      size is no larger than the maximum size listed on the structure table
      below. When you retrieve an object stored this way, it appears in an
      unoccupied, adjacent square. It must be placed on a suitably supportive
      surface; a boat could be placed on a relatively flat plain or a large body
      of water, but not midair.</p>
