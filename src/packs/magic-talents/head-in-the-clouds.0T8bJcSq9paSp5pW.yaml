      <p>You may use a standard action spent to concentrate on a shroud to also
      cast a new shroud, and may maintain up to two shroud effects through
      concentration as part of the same action. This talent may be taken more
      than once, each time increasing the number of shroud effects you can
      concentrate on as part of the same action by one.</p>
