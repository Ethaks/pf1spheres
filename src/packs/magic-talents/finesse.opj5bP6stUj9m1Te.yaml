      <p>You may use telekinesis to perform fine manipulations, such as turning
      a key in a lock, unrolling a scroll, or tying a knot. You may attempt
      appropriate skill checks (such as Craft, Disable Device, Profession, or
      Performance checks that involve objects or instruments, but not Sleight of
      Hand or other checks involving attended objects unless you possess the
      Steal talent) at a distance, as well as Heal checks to perform first aid.
      When performing a skill at a distance you may use your casting ability
      modifier in place of the normal ability modifier, but you also suffer a -5
      penalty to the skill check and cannot take 10. You may also use Sustained
      Force to maintain complicated, non-combat procedures such as making knives
      prepare dinner, make a lute play itself, or making a shovel dig a
      ditch.</p>
