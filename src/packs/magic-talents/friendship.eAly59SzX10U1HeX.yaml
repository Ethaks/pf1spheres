      <p>You may create an aegis that gives a creature special protection from
      the spell, spell-like, sphere and supernatural abilities of his allies.
      Whenever one of that creature&#8217;s allies uses a spell, spell-like, or
      sphere ability that is subject to spell resistance and covers an area, or
      a supernatural ability that covers an area, allies with this aegis and
      their equipment are treated as if they were immune. This aegis does not
      block beneficial effects from a creature's allies.</p>
