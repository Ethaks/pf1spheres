      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Dodge:</strong> The target gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC.</p>

      <p><strong>Evasion:</strong> The target gains incredible reflexes. When
      the target succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that
      normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes no
      damage. This ability does not function when wearing medium or heavy
      armor.</p>

      <p><strong>Initiative:</strong> The target gains quickened reactions,
      granting a +4 competence bonus to initiative.</p>

      <p><strong>Uncanny Dodge:</strong> The target gains extraordinary
      reactions, granting uncanny dodge as the rogue ability. The target is no
      longer flat-footed at the start of combat nor loses Dexterity to AC
      against invisible attackers. If the target is granted this trait a second
      time or already has the uncanny dodge ability from another source, they
      instead gain improved uncanny dodge as the rogue ability. The target can
      no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak
      attack the target by flanking, unless the attacker has at least four more
      rogue levels than the target has Hit Dice.</p>
