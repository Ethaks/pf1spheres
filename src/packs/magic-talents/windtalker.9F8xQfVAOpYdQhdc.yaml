      <p>As a trick you may use your illusions to signal or communicate. This
      functions as the deliver secret message use of the Bluff skill but you
      gain a +5 + caster level circumstance bonus to the Bluff check and can do
      so within your maximum illusion range without penalty. The recipients must
      still interact with the illusion in some way to get the intended message.
      This communication only works one way but is not language dependant and
      may rely on any sense or complex sense the intended recipients
      possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess Selective Illusions, there is no chance of the message
      being intercepted.</p>
