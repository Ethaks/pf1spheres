      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bear sphere, Antarctic Circle, 10th
      caster level or higher.</p>

      <p>When creating an antarctic circle, you may spend 2 spell points instead
      of 1 to transform it into an arctic circle instead of an antarctic circle.
      An arctic circle attracts bears, both natural (if any are nearby) and
      summoned (if there aren&#8217;t). It takes 1 minute for bears to arrive if
      natural bears are attracted, but summoned bears can take up to an hour to
      arrive.</p>

      <p>When the bears do arrive, they form a troop that obeys the caster. The
      bear troop lasts for 1 minute per caster level before dissipating as the
      bears either disappear or go back to their normal homes.</p>

      <p>At 10th caster level, you may summon a black bear troop.</p>

      <p>At 15th caster level you may summon a grizzly bear troop.</p>

      <p>At 20th caster level you may summon a dire bear troop.</p>

      <p>Statistics for bear troops are found under the Bestiary section
      below.</p>
