      <p>Your cure ability heals an additional 1 hit point per caster level. As
      a special application of restore, you may restore a creature&#8217;s
      movement and physical capacity instead of restoring mind, body, or soul.
      This allows a target to make an immediate Escape Artist check with a
      circumstance bonus equal to your caster level against any applicable
      condition (for example, if it is entangled or grappled), and the target is
      cured of the stunned condition. This also removes the lessening of a
      target&#8217;s movement speed or removal of a movement type, or any other
      similar detriment such as the loss of the power of speech. If the target
      is under a spell or effect that causes paralysis, you may attempt a magic
      skill check against the spell or effect, removing the condition if you
      succeed.</p>
