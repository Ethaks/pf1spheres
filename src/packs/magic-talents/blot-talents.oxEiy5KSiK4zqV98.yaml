      <p>Dark talents listed with the (blot) tag are treated the same as talents
      with the (darkness) tag, except in addition to adding an effect, they
      cause the darkness to manifest as a blot. A blot is a darkness effect
      created on a two-dimensional surface, such as the ground or a wall,
      appearing as an inky coating rather than a volume of decreased
      illumination. Blots do not affect the light level of the area.</p>

      <p>Only one (blot) talent may be applied to an individual blot, and a
      single darkness effect cannot be affected by both a (blot) and (darkness)
      talent at the same time, but blots and darknesses with different effects
      may overlap. Individual blots do not stack with themselves, nor do they
      stack with similar (darkness) talents.</p>

      <p>If a talent is labeled as (blot) and (darkness), the caster may decide
      which tag to use when applying the talent to an area of darkness.</p>

      <p>In order for a blot to affect a target, it must be in contact with the
      blot. Blots count as areas of darkness with respect to melds and
      interactions with Light sphere effects and talents.</p>
