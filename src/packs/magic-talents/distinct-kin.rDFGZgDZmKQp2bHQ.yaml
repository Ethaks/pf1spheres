      <p>Any companions you gain from the Conjuration sphere may be treated as
      having a single subtype of your choice corresponding to a specific family
      of creatures that share their alignment (such as angel, demon, or devil).
      This does not grant the companion the abilities of that subtype, but they
      count as creatures of that subtype for the purpose of determining how
      abilities affect them. In addition, they learn one language spoken by
      creatures of their subtype.</p>
