      <p>You may grant a motif that empowers the target almost at random. Roll
      1d4 when you grant the motif. The target gains a +1 insight bonus to rolls
      indicated on the table below. This bonus increases by +1 for every 10
      caster levels. In addition, for every 10 caster levels, roll an additional
      1d4, applying the bonus to that category as well. Bonuses from rolling the
      same result more than once stack.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect to gain an insight bonus to a
      single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, ability check, initiative
      roll, or concentration check equal to twice the sum of the d4 rolls. They
      must choose to do so before rolling.</p>
