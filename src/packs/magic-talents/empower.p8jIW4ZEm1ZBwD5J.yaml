      <p>You may spend a spell point to rally a target, giving them a +4 morale
      bonus to either attack rolls and CMB, AC and CMD, saving throws, or
      concentration checks and spell penetration checks. The bonus from this
      rally lasts 1 round. The decision to use this rally in response to an
      attack must be made prior to the attack roll, and the decision to use this
      rally in response to a saving throw must be made before the save is
      rolled.</p>
