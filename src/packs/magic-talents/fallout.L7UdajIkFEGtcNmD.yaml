    value: >
      <p>Fallout of severity level 3 forces creatures inside the area to attempt
      a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1 point
      of Constitution damage.</p>

      <p>Severity level 4 functions as severity level 3, save that checks must
      be made every 10 minutes rather than every hour.</p>

      <p>Severity level 5 functions as severity level 4, save that checks must
      be made every minute rather than every hour and Constitution damage
      improves to 1d2.</p>

      <p>Severity level 6 functions as severity level 5, save that checks must
      be made every round rather than every minute and the Constitution damage
      becomes 1d4 Constitution drain.</p>

      <p>Severity level 7 functions as severity level 6, save that it deals 2d4
      points of Constitution drain.</p>

      <p>Damage from fallout is a poison effect.</p>

      <p>Fallout is a type of radioactive weather, and thus requires the
      Radiation Lord advanced talent to create.</p>
