    value: >
      <p>When an ally hits an enemy with a weapon attack with a natural roll of
      16 or greater, they may spend a point of momentum to have the attack be
      considered a critical hit for the purpose of triggering critical feats.
      This does not make the hit an actual critical hit, and no confirmation
      roll is required. This can allow a critical feat to be triggered even if
      the target is immune to critical hits. The normal rules for critical feats
      apply. If the attack was already a threat, they may spend a point of
      momentum to confirm it instead. They must do this before rolling to
      confirm.</p>
