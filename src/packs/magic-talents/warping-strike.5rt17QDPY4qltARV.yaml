    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in
      conjunction with making a teleport or activating a (space) talent that
      targets a creature or object. This casting cannot be reduced below a
      standard action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as
      usual if making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it
      is also struck by the teleport or (space) talent. You can only teleport a
      willing target unless you also use Unwilling Teleport. If using a scatter
      weapon, the sphere effect only applies to a single target, chosen at the
      time of attack.</p>
