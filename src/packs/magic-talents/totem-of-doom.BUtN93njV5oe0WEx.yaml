    value: >
      <p>You must spend a spell point to place a totem of doom. All enemies in
      the area become shaken (no save). This effect lasts as long as they remain
      within the totem&#8217;s effect area. The effects of this totem are not
      cumulative with itself or other sources of fear.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a total of three times. If taken twice, your
      totem of doom becomes cumulative; if a creature comes into contact with
      your totem of doom who is already shaken from another effect, the effect
      of your totem of doom is changed to frightened for that specific creature.
      If you gain this talent three times, a creature who comes into contact
      with your totem of doom who is already frightened from another effect
      becomes panicked. Multiple totems of doom do not stack with each other for
      this purpose.</p>
