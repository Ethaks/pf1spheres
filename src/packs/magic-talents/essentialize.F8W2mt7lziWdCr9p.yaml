      <p>You may manipulate an ongoing magical effect that still holds most of
      its magical power to fuel yourself. You may target a creature within range
      that is currently under the effects of a harmless sphere effect, causing
      the effect to end. If the effect had a duration greater than 1 minute, and
      at least half or more of its original duration remaining, you convert it
      into raw energy, granting yourself temporary spell points equal to half
      the effect&#8217;s cost in spell points (minimum 1). If the effect cost no
      spell points to cast, or was cast using temporary spell points (either
      partially or in full), you gain no spell points. At 10th level, you
      instead gain spell points equal to its full cost, but only if the duration
      was greater than 1 hour.</p>

      <p>Targeting yourself with this ability only requires a swift action, and
      targeting an unwilling creature requires you to attempt a magic skill
      check against the effect, with a -2 penalty on the attempt. If you possess
      the Counterspell feat, you reduce this penalty to 0. If you fail to use
      this ability on a magical effect, you may not try to dispel that effect
      again for 24 hours.</p>
