      <p>You may direct your animated branches to attack as a free action
      instead of a move action. In addition, you may cause a branch to perform
      any of the following actions instead of making an attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Aggravating Vegetation:</strong> You may instruct the
      vegetation to focus on antagonizing its target instead of making a regular
      attack. The branch or tree makes an attack roll as an antagonize check
      against the target&#8217;s Psychology DC (10 + Hit Dice + Wisdom modifier;
      or 10 + Sense Motive bonus, if it is higher). Unlike a normal antagonize
      check, you do not suffer a &#8211;4 penalty on antagonize attempts made
      against opponents of a different creature type or that are of animal
      intelligence (Intelligence 1 or 2). Creatures who have been previously
      antagonized gain a +4 bonus to their Psychology DC. Mindless creatures are
      immune to the effects of antagonize.</p>

      <p>Antagonize is a mind-affecting effect. If you successfully beat the
      target&#8217;s Psychology DC, the creature, instead of taking damage,
      gains the antagonized condition against the attacking vegetation. The
      antagonized condition remains for 1 round. The duration of this condition
      increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat your opponent&#8217;s
      Psychology DC.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Antagonized
      Condition:</strong></span> The antagonized condition appears in Ultimate
      Charisma, published and copyrighted by Everyman's Game, LLC.</p>

      <p>An antagonized creature can only target its antagonist (the one who
      caused the antagonized condition) with hostile actions. A hostile action
      is any attack or effect that causes direct harm to an opponent in the form
      of damage, negative conditions, or any other effect that penalizes or
      hinders a creature. Furthermore, an antagonized creature does not threaten
      any opponents except its antagonist: it cannot make attacks of opportunity
      or be used to determine flanking bonuses against other opponents. A
      creature is no longer antagonized if its antagonist is helpless,
      unconscious, or cannot participate in combat. If an antagonizes creature
      uses an ability that targets multiple creatures, the antagonist must be
      chosen among these targets. If an antagonized creature uses an ability
      that targets an area, its antagonist must be within the ability's targeted
      area.</p>

      <p>On each round after the first, an antagonized creature may attempt a
      Sense Motive skill check as a swift action to realize the folly of its
      actions. This skill check is opposed by the antagonist's original
      antagonize skill check. If the creature succeeds on its Sense Motive skill
      check, the antagonized condition ends, but the creature suffers a -2
      penalty on attack rolls and a -2 penalty to the saving throw DC of its
      abilities and any spells it casts for 1 minute. These penalties do not
      apply against the antagonist.</p>

      <p><strong>Sap Conglutination:</strong> Instead of a regular attack, you
      may instruct the vegetation to excrete a rubbery resin and attempt to coat
      the target with it. Targets hit by the attack become coated with this sap
      and gain the fatigued condition until they remove it as a full-round
      action. If a fatigued creature becomes coated with sap a second time, they
      gain the exhausted condition until the sap is removed as a full-round
      action.</p>
