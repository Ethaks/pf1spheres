      "value": "<p>You may gain a supernatural sense depending on what Nature packages you possess for as long as you concentrate, or you may spend a spell point to gain the sense for 1 minute per caster level. This sense has a range equal to your geomancing range. Each sense must be gained as a separate effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Air: Cloudsight (Su):</strong> You gain mistsight, except allowing you to only see through clouds of fog, mist, and smoke as if they were transparent. In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures that are flying or have the air subtype provided they are within range of your cloudsight.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth: Earthsight (Su):</strong> You gain tremorsense, only allowing you to detect anything in contact with the same body of ground as you. In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures that are underground or have the earth subtype provided they are within range of your earthsight.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire: Firesight (Su):</strong> You can see through flames, lava, and smoke as if they were transparent. In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures that are on fire or have the fire subtype provided they are within range of your firesight.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal: Metalsight (Su):</strong> You gain the scent ability, except only allowing you to detect metal objects (including creatures wearing or carrying metal objects). In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment or total concealment against ferrous creatures or creatures that have the clockwork or robot subtypes provided they are within range of your metalsight.</p>\n<p><strong>Plant: Plantsight (Su):</strong> You gain greensight, except only allowing you to see through leaves, living wood, greenery, undergrowth, and vines as if they were transparent (you still cannot see through dead wood). In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures that are entangled in plantlife or of the plant creature type provided they are within range of your greensight.</p>\n<p><strong>Water: Watersense (Su):</strong> You gain tremorsense, except only allowing you to detect anything in contact with the same body of water as you. In addition, you do not suffer miss chance from concealment or total concealment against creatures that are underwater or have the water subtype provided they are within range of your watersense.</p>\n",
