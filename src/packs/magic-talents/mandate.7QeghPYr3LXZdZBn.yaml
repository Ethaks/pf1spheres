      <p>Talents marked (mandate) grant you ways of creating mandates. Mandates
      are effects that exist between a pair of allies, each of whom benefits
      from the actions of the other. As a standard action, you can create a
      mandate between two allies within medium range, one of whom may be
      yourself. You may concentrate to maintain a mandate, or can spend a spell
      point to make it last 1 minute per level without concentration. A mandate
      only works while the two sharing the mandate are within medium range of
      each other, and both are conscious and able to act.</p>

      <p>A creature can be part of multiple mandates with the same or different
      creatures, but cannot be a member of the same mandate type talent multiple
      times. Bonuses granted last until the end of the next turn of the ally who
      received the bonus. The advantage of a mandate can be triggered over and
      over again, though it does not stack with itself.</p>
