    value: >
      <p>Your companion mimics the properties of undead. It is healed by
      negative energy and harmed by positive energy. The companion gains the
      undead creature type. The companion also gains +2 channel resistance, as
      well as a +2 bonus on saves against disease, exhaustion, fatigue,
      paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. These bonuses and channel
      resistance increases by +1 per 2 Hit Dice.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice. If taken twice, your companion gains
      immunity to disease, exhaustion, fatigue, paralysis, poison, sleep
      effects, and stunning, and your companion no longer needs to breathe,
      granting it immunity to drowning, suffocation, or gas-based effects.</p>
