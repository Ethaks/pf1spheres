      <p>Your areas of darkness and blot flow through cracks and crevices like a
      viscous liquid, allowing them to extend around corners and pass through
      small cracks and crevices to reach their full radius. Your blot and
      darkness can flow through porous obstacles such as the gaps around a
      typical door, a wall rife with rodent holes, or ill-fitting masonry, but
      not through sealed structures like a ship&#8217;s hull, a secure safe, or
      a properly mortared wall.</p>
