      <p>You may create a ward that creates a mostly-transparent wall of force
      at its perimeter. While this barrier does not block line of sight, it does
      block line of effect; thus, while you could still target a creature
      through the barrier (such as for an attack that attempts to break the
      barrier and still deal damage to the creature on the other side), the
      barrier does stop attacks, movement, breath weapons, and any spells or
      sphere effects that rely on line of effect until the barrier is destroyed.
      Ethereal creatures are technically stopped by the barrier, but can usually
      find a way around it (as the barrier does not cut through objects, and so
      usually stops at ground level). Creatures inside a space where a barrier
      is created are shunted to the nearest empty space on the outside.</p>

      <p>A barrier has hit points equal to twice your caster level and a Break
      DC of 15 + 1/2 your caster level. A barrier can hold weight, up to 2,400
      lbs. + 250 lbs. per caster level; beyond that, a barrier simply shatters
      as if broken with a Strength check. If a barrier is broken anywhere, the
      entire effect ends.</p>

      <p>If an attack is directed at a target through the barrier, the attack
      first deals its damage to the barrier itself. If this damage is enough to
      destroy the barrier, the attack continues on to its intended target,
      although damage dealt to the barrier is subtracted from any damage done to
      the target or targets. Burst-effect attacks such as splash weapons,
      fireball spells, or others attempting to travel through the barrier
      explode at the barrier&#8217;s edge and also must overcome the
      barrier&#8217;s hit points to damage targets on the other side. If you
      maintain your barrier through concentration, its hit points are renewed
      each round on your turn.</p>

      <p>Certain protection talents grant you additional aegises or wards, and
