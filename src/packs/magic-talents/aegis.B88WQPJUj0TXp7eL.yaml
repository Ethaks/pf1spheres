    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you may touch a creature and spend a spell point,
      granting them an aegis for 1 hour per caster level. Unwilling targets are
      allowed a Will save to resist gaining an aegis, and aegis is subject to
      spell resistance.</p>

      <p>Multiple aegises of the same talent can be placed on a single creature,
      and the creature can benefit from them when they are providing different
      effects. This means Armored Magic can give a target both armor and shield,
      and Energy Resistance can grant resistance to multiple energy types to the
      same target.</p>

      <p>You gain the following aegis when you gain the Protection sphere:</p>
