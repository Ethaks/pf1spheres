    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to force a target creature to state their
      name, the kind of creature they are (typically their creature type,
      subtypes, or both), where they came from, why they are where they are, and
      where they are going. They speak in whichever language they are most
      comfortable with (usually one of the ones gained from their race), which
      you may or may not understand.</p>

      <p>A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a
      mind-affecting compulsion effect and creatures that do not speak any
      languages (including telepathy) are immune to it.</p>
