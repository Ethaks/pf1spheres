      <p>You create an area of darkness or blot which you may manipulate to
      perform minor feats of legerdemain. Once per round as a free action you
      may make a pickpocket attempt or a Steal combat maneuver against a target
      that is within your darkness or blot. You may use your own Sleight of Hand
      modifier or Steal CMB or your caster level + your casting ability
      modifier, whichever is higher.</p>

      <p>You may instead retrieve one unattended item that is within your area
      of blot or darkness once per round as a free action. Whether the item is
      retrieved or stolen, it appears in your hands or in the nearest adjacent
      space if your hands are full. An item retrieved or stolen cannot weigh
      more than 5 lbs. per caster level.</p>
