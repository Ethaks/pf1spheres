      <p>You may craft your destructive blast into a 5-foot-by-5-foot cubic wall
      with a duration of concentration, so long as it is fully contained within
      your destructive blast range. You may spend a spell point to increase this
      effect and create a wall up to 20 feet high and up to 20 feet wide per
      caster level in a straight line, or a hemisphere with a radius up to 5
      feet per 2 caster levels (minimum 5 feet). If used in either way, the
      duration increases to 1 round per caster level.</p>

      <p>The wall does not block line of effect, line of sight, projectiles, or
      thrown objects. Creatures passing through your wall suffer your
      destructive blast&#8217;s damage and effects as normal. Creatures standing
      in the wall&#8217;s space when it is created are allowed a Reflex save to
      avoid damage.</p>
