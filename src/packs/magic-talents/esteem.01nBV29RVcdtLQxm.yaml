    value: >
      <p>You imbue a target with an increased sense of self-worth, capacity for
      persuasion, and force of personality (Will negates).</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You grant a competence bonus to a single
      Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-based skill check of the target&#8217;s
      choice equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1) that is performed within
      1 hour + 1 hour per 5 caster levels. The target counts as enchanted while
      under the effects of this charm, and a DC 25 Sense Motive check will
      determine that the target is not wholly acting as themselves.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> This acts the same as the lesser charm,
      but the bonus to the check now equals your caster level. As a drawback to
      this charm, this DC of the Sense Motive check to detect the charm on the
      target is reduced to 15. This level of the charm may only be used once per
      day on a target.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> As the greater charm, but the check
      may be performed within 1 day + 1 day per 5 caster levels. This level of
      the charm may only be used once per week on a target.</p>
