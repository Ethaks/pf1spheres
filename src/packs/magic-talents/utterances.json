      "value": "<p>You tamper with a mind&#8217;s language center, and the muscles controlling speech to impede or alter the flow of words. Will save negates.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You can tug on the strings of conversation, altering the sounds of words, inserting or negating vocalizations as you see fit. You may impose a failure chance on any other magic user whose magic requires a verbal component equal to 10% + an additional 5% for every 5 caster levels (this effect stacks with similar failure chances, such as the 20% chance that accompanies the deafened condition). In addition, you may impose a circumstance bonus or penalty to the target&#8217;s Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform checks equal to 2 + 1 per every 5 caster levels. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> In addition to the effects of the lesser charm, you may wrest full control from a target&#8217;s speech by stopping them from speaking entirely or choosing words for them to say. This can prevent a target from using magic that requires verbal components or other vocalizations, and can force a target that remains within range to only say what you want them to say. A target not specifically under the mental command to remain silent will be able to say whatever it wishes if it leaves the range of the effect. If you attempt to make a target say something that would be against the target&#8217;s nature (such as a young lover renouncing affection for his or her betrothed, or a dragon agreeing to a verbal contract to part with some of its treasure), it gains another Will save to resist the effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> Your control over the speech of the target is fluid and nearly flawless. In addition to the effects of the lesser and greater charms, you may make the target speak so eloquently that you may roll a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Perform check through them using your own ranks instead of its own, provided that the check in question is vocal in nature. You may also make use of the target&#8217;s ranks in these skills yourself, borrowing the talent or, if you wish, allowing the target to directly speak through you. You may also use magic that requires verbal components (but no other components) through the target, as if the magic originated from the target&#8217;s space. Casters with the Gestures talent may include somatic components with no extra save required.</p>\n",
