      <p>You may study a creature you can see as a full-round action or spend a
      spell point to instead study it as a swift action. For the next hour or
      until you study another creature, you gain a single Alteration talent
      corresponding to the creature or one of the creature&#8217;s apparent
      features. A creature you have studied with this talent counts as being
      familiar for the purposes of the Perfect Imitation talent.</p>
