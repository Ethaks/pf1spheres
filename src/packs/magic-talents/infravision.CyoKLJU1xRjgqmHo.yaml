    value: >
      <p>You may slightly shift the spectrum of light, granting the target the
      ability to see heat. This allows them to ignore the miss chance for less
      than total concealment on living creatures. In addition, the target is
      capable of tracking living creatures by the heat they leave in their
      tracks. So long as the trail is no more than an hour old, the ground
      condition is never treated as worse than soft ground (DC 10), though
      strong temperature conditions (such as winter snow or a desert noon) can
      negate this benefit.</p>
