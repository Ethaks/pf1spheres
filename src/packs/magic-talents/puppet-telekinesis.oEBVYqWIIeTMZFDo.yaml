      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Telekinesis sphere (Finesse,
      Telekinetic Maneuver), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When you lift a creature with your telekinesis you may spend a spell
      point to take precise control over their physical form. You can force them
      to run, jump, manipulate objects, and wield weapons, but you cannot force
      them to use special abilities such as spells that are not a function of
      bodily movement, and cannot take control of their vocal cords, though you
      can prevent them from making sounds. If you force the subject to engage in
      combat, use an attack bonus equal to your base attack plus your casting
      ability modifier, and substitute your casting ability modifier for any
      ability modifiers on damage rolls. In addition, substitute your casting
      ability modifier for the subject&#8217;s Dexterity modifier when
      determining armor class. When performing actions that would require a
      skill check, use your skill ranks plus your casting ability modifier for
      the check.</p>

      <p>Since the subject is only under your physical control, on their turn
      they can still take purely mental actions. You must use Hostile Lift to
      affect an unwilling creature, and they are allowed the normal Will saves
      to negate the effect.</p>
