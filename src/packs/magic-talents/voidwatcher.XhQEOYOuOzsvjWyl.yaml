      <p>You may spend a spell point to grant a target a heightened awareness of
      things lurking in darkness for 1 hour per caster level. The target gains
      blindsense with a range of close, except only allowing the target to
      detect anything that casts a shadow. The target may also detect anything
      inside of or in contact with an area of your darkness as though it were
      within range of this blindsense. In addition, the target rolls twice and
      takes the highest roll on any Perception checks made to notice someone or
      something in an area of dim light or darkness.</p>
