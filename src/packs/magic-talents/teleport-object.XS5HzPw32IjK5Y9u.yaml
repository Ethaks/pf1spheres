    value: >
      <p>You may teleport objects independent of people. The object cannot weigh
      more than 10 pounds per caster level, and it cannot be in the possession
      of another creature (in their hand or on their person). If a creature is
      willing, you may teleport the object directly into their hand or onto
      their person.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Ranged Warp talent, you may, as a readied action,
      catch a projectile out of the air that passes within range, redirecting it
      against another target if you wish. The creature who initiated the attack
      is allowed a Will save to negate this effect, and you must make an attack
      roll against the new target, but using your casting ability modifier in
      place of Dexterity when making the attack. Damage is still determined by
      the creature who initiated the attack.</p>
