      <p>As a swift action, you can learn any conditions that are affecting a
      living creature (unconscious, dying, nauseated, panicked, stunned,
      poisoned, diseased, confused, etc.) within range of your Life sphere
      abilities.</p>

      <p>By increasing the casting time of this ability to a standard action or
      by spending a spell point, you can learn the details of any condition they
      are under, such as whether they have been affected by a spell or the
      nature of any disease or poison they are afflicted with. You may use this
      on a deceased creature to determine how they died, so long as the target
      has been dead for no more than one day per caster level.</p>

      <p>You may also use this ability on any ally that is currently under the
      effect of one of your Life sphere abilities regardless of range or line of
      effect (such as allies who currently possess temporary hit points from
      your invigorate ability), as long as they are on the same plane of
      existence. You always know the direction and distance to your ally.</p>
