    value: >
      <p>For the duration of the fey-link, you can teleport up to 10 feet as a
      move action. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity and
      you must have line of sight to your destination.</p>

      <p>This distance increases by 5 feet at 4th caster level and every 2
      caster levels thereafter. If you possess Tree Meld, while melded to a
      tree, you may move to another tree within close range as a move action or
      medium range as a standard action. You may only move to trees in this
      fashion once per 1d4 rounds.</p>
