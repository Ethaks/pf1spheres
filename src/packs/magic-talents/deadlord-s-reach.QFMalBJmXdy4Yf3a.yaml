      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Icy Grip, any one
      (dominion) talent), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>While an undead you reanimated is within your dominion range, you may
      spend an additional spell point as part of creating a magical sphere
      effect to treat the undead as the point of origin for any effect you
      create. Personal-range spells take effect on the undead channeling the
      effect rather than yourself.</p>
