      <p>This ward presents subtle inconsistencies and misdirections that
      prevent entry. Creatures must have an Intelligence of at least 3 to enter
      into the warded area. Teleportation bypasses the effect of this ward, and
      low-intelligence creatures can still be pushed or otherwise motivated into
      the ward area by other more intelligent creatures or by accident.</p>
