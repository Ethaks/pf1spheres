    value: >
      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Cold of severity
      level 3 or higher, they gain a glare attack that deals 1d6 cold damage,
      plus 1d6 cold damage for each severity level above 3. This functions as a
      gaze attack with a range of 30 feet, except that it only affects a single
      creature each round and only if they focus on a target as a swift action.
      A successful Fortitude save halves this damage, and the attack is not
      hindered by precipitation.</p>

      <p>In addition, a creature bearing your mantle can see clearly through
      falling snow and sleet as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring miss
      chance from these obstructions, up to the normal limits of their
      vision.</p>
