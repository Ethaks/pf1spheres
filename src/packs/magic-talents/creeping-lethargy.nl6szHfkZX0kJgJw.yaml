    value: >
      <p>Your darkness fogs the mind, causing those within to slip towards
      slumber. By spending a spell point you may create a darkness or blot
      effect that forces creatures within it to succeed at a Will save or become
      staggered. Creatures that fail this save and remain staggered must succeed
      at another Will save at the beginning of your next turn or fall asleep for
      1 round per caster level or until the darkness expires, whichever happens
      first. A successful save negates all effects and the target is immune to
      that instance of Creeping Lethargy. Leaving the area of darkness
      automatically rouses the creature and removes the staggered condition, but
      does not render the creature immune should it re-enter the area of effect.
      This is a mind-affecting, sleep effect.</p>
