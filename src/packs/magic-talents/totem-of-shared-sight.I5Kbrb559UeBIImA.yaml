    value: >
      <p>You and your allies can share perception, seeing through each
      other&#8217;s eyes and hearing through each other&#8217;s ears. Anything
      visible or noticed by one is also perceived by everyone else, including
      with special senses such as blindsense or scent. This can prevent a
      character from being surprised. If any ally within the totem successfully
      saves versus an illusion effect, then everyone else automatically succeeds
      at their saving throw as well, even if they previously failed. This totem
      does not prevent allies from being flanked.</p>
