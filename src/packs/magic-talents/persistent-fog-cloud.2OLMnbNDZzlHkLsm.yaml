      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((water) package, Deep
      Nature), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 additional spell points when using the (water)
      geomancing Fog ability to change the duration of the fog from
      concentration to permanent. The fog in this form becomes an insubstantial
      object without hit points. You may concentrate on the fog to have it move
      up to 1/2 your speed in any direction. If targeted or otherwise in the
      area of an ability from the Weather sphere, the caster using the Weather
      sphere must attempt a magic skill check against your magic skill defense.
      If the Weather sphere user is successful, the fog is immediately
      dispelled. It is otherwise not subject to the effects of weather not
      created by magic.</p>
