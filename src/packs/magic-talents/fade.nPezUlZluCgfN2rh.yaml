      <p>You fade from view while in a creature&#8217;s peripheral vision. You
      gain concealment from any creature that you are flanking. You may dismiss
      this fey-blessing as a standard action to attempt a Stealth check to hide.
      You may reduce this to a swift action by spending a spell point. You may
      attempt this check even if you are observed and have no concealment. Any
      creature that fails its Perception check cannot see you and treats you as
      having full concealment until the start of your next turn. Making an
      attack, casting a spell or sphere ability with verbal or somatic
      components or subject to the Magical Signs drawback, speaking, or other
      loud or distracting actions ends this effect.</p>
