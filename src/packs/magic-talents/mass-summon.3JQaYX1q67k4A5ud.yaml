    value: >
      <p>When you summon a companion, you may spend an additional spell point to
      summon an additional companion that you possess. You must spend 1
      additional spell point per companion, but may summon up to 1 additional
      companion, +1 per 5 caster levels you possess as part of the same
      action.</p>

      <p>Additional costs to summon each companion must be paid separately, as
      well as spell points spent to allow the companions to endure without
      concentration. However, if you choose to maintain these summoned
      companions via concentration, you may maintain all companions summoned
      through Mass Summon as part of the same concentration action.</p>
