      <p>You may create a darkness effect that has a chance to disorient anyone
      who enters it. When a creature within this area attempts to move, or when
      a creature first enters this area, they must succeed at a Will save or
      become disoriented. A creature must attempt this Will save every time they
      enter the area of darkness. If the creature fails this saving throw, they
      must roll a d8 to determine direction: 1 is their intended direction, with
      2-8 rotating around the creature in a clockwise direction. The target
      moves that direction as if it were their intended course. The target does
      not realize they are off-course until their next turn or until they leave
      the area of darkness.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a total of three times. If taken twice, you
      gain a portion of control over your targets&#8217; delusions. When a
      creature that has failed it save against your disorienting darkness
      attempts to move, you may spend an immediate action to choose their
      direction of travel instead of rolling randomly.</p>

      <p>If taken three times, you gain even more influence over your victims.
      When a creature that has failed its save against your disorienting
      darkness makes an attack, casts a targeted spell or spell-like ability, or
      uses a supernatural or extraordinary ability with a specified target, the
      attack or ability is randomly directed to another legal target within
      range (excluding the attacker itself). If there is no other legal target
      within range, the attack or ability is not affected. If the affected spell
      or ability has more than one target, all its targets are randomly chosen
      from among the legal targets within range. Alternatively, you may select
      the new target or targets as an immediate action instead of determining
      them randomly. Chosen targets must be legal and you must be able to
      perceive them.</p>
