    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to use blood control to take control of the
      target&#8217;s body. For 1 round per caster level or until the blood
      control ends (whichever comes first), you can concentrate on the target,
      spending an action to force the target&#8217;s body to take the same type
      of action, acting on simultaneously.</p>

      <p>The puppetted creature&#8217;s body is under your control, but the
      creature&#8217;s mind is not. Creatures capable of taking purely mental
      actions can still do so. If you spend at least a standard action
      controlling the puppet, this counts as concentrating on the blood control.
      A creature under the effects of this ability cannot take physical action
      on its own; treat this as being dazed, though immunity to and bonuses on
      saving throws against the dazed condition does not apply. The target may
      be forced to take harmful actions. A target forced to hurt or kill itself
      deals its weapon damage + its Strength modifier to itself per round as a
      standard action. The target may still perform mental-only actions while
      under the effects of Blood Puppet (such as attempting to end the blood
      control). This ability does not grant access to the target&#8217;s
      memories, thoughts, casting, supernatural, or spelllike abilities, nor is
      your control fine enough to force the target to speak intelligibly.</p>

      <p>Effects such as the protection from evil spell or the Hallow word of
      the Fate sphere do not end this effect, since it is the result of a
      physical malady rather than a mind-affecting or possession effect.</p>

      <p>If you possess Mass Blood Magic, you may take control and command
      multiple puppets, but must divide a single round&#8217;s worth of actions
      between all puppets.</p>
