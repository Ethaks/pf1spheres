    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to grant the target the ability to make
      precision strikes for 1 hour per caster level. Whenever the target attacks
      a creature it is flanking, that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, or
      that is not able to perceive the creature (such as through a successful
      Stealth check), it deals an additional 1d6 points of precision damage to
      the target, +1d6 per 10 caster levels. This damage is not multiplied on a
      critical hit, but it does stack with a rogue&#8217;s sneak attack. This
      only functions while within an area of your darkness.</p>
