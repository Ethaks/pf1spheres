      <p>You may create a ward that renders all creatures within incapable of
      causing violence. Any violent action or targeted offensive magical effect
      created within the ward fails and the target&#8217;s action is wasted
      (Will negates). If any target succeeds at this Will save, the ward&#8217;s
      effect immediately ends for all. When a Peacebound ward is broken in this
      fashion, all creatures within become immune to that caster&#8217;s
      Peacebound ward for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>You may also create an aegis that makes the target immune to violent
      actions or magic. Any such action made against the target requires the
      attacker to succeed at a Will save or lose that action. If a creature
      succeeds at this Will save they are immune to the effects of that casting
      of this aegis. If the bearer of the Peacebound aegis takes an offensive
      action against any creature, the aegis immediately ends.</p>
