      <p>You may spend one spell point to freeze all activity within a 10-foot
      radius burst, + 5 feet per 5 caster levels. If used as a readied action,
      this can stop ranged attacks or instantaneous magical effects (such as
      destructive blasts), but in the case of effects that target areas, only
      the effect contained within the Time Freeze&#8217;s area is stopped.
      Unwilling targets (including allies if they choose) are allowed a Will
      save to negate this effect for themselves or effects originating from them
      (attacks, magic, etc.). You can choose whether or not to affect yourself
      with your own time freeze.</p>

      <p>All affected objects and creatures within this area cannot act for 1
      round, neither can they be acted upon (moved, dealt damage to, etc.). Once
      the effect is in place, non-affected creatures can enter the area of
      effect without incident, so long as they do not disturb an affected
      creature or object. After one round has passed, everything within the area
      is unfrozen; creatures resume moving, ranged attacks hit the square they
      were targeting, and blast effects resolve as normal.</p>
