      <p>You may spend a spell point to rally a target, allowing them to swap
      positions with an adjacent ally. This does not draw attacks of
      opportunity. Both allies must be capable of movement for this to work,
      even if they can only crawl. If this is done in response to an attack,
      then the target of the attack changes to the other ally.</p>
