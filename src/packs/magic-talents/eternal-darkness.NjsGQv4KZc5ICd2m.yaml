      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Lingering Darkness),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When creating darkness, you may spend 2 spell points to turn your
      darkness into a permanent effect that lasts until it is dispelled. Once
      created, this darkness is unmoving. It cannot be centered on a creature or
      object with the Clinging Darkness talent, and cannot be moved with the
      Rolling Blackout talent, though you can adjust its area with Shifting
      Shadows.</p>
