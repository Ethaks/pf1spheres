      <p>You may spend a spell point to gain a sense that warns you of impending
      danger. You are not flat-footed during the surprise round or the first
      round of combat before you act, and gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC, and a +2
      bonus to Reflex saves and initiative checks. These bonuses increase by 1
      for every 10 caster levels possessed.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> You are flat-footed until you have acted once
      in the initiative order.</p>
