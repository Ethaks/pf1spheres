      <p>When you create a ward, you may alter its shape so that it takes the
      form of a close-range cone or a medium-range line, each emanating from
      yourself (or from within a location where you could center a ward if you
      possess the Distant Protection talent). If you spend 1 additional spell
      point, you may shape the ward in any area you desire out of contiguous
      5-foot cubes, up to a maximum of 2 cubes per caster level.</p>

      <p>When using this talent in conjunction with a barrier, each cube is a
      separate object that completely fills a 5-foot square, and has 5 hit
      points, or 4 + your caster level hit points if you possess the Greater
      Barrier talent. Like a barrier, the cubes are mostly-transparent, and they
      block the same modes of attack. They are otherwise materially identical to
      a barrier, and have the same Break DC. Objects and creatures can not be
      trapped within a cube, and the presence of a creature in a square prevents
      the barrier cube from forming there. Barrier cubes must be created at
      ground level, but can be stacked on top of each other and used to form
      arches, stairs, or other shapes. All cubes must be created within an area
      you could cover with a ward.</p>

      <p>This talent replaces Barrier Maze.</p>
