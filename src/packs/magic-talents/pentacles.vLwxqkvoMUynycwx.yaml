    value: >
      <p>You actualize the target&#8217;s success and prosperity. When granted
      as a motif, the target gains a +1 bonus on one saving throw, chosen when
      granted as a motif. This bonus increases by +1 for every 10 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect as an immediate action to gain a
      prenatural sense for success. For the next minute per caster level, after
      the target misses or fails a d20 roll, such as missing their target with
      an attack roll, failing a saving throw, or failing a skill check, the
      target may reroll their attempt and accept the new result. The target may
      reroll this way once during the discharge effect&#8217;s duration, plus an
      additional time per 10 caster levels you possess.</p>
