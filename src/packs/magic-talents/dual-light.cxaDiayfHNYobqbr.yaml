      <p>By spending a spell point you can simultaneously apply two different
      (light) talents you possess to your glow. The effect of each talent is
      resolved separately, and you must pay the spell point costs of each one
      individually, though other costs (such as for metamagic or maintaining
      bright light without concentration) are only incurred once.</p>
