      <p>As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and
      instill a sense inside it, or spend a spell point to instill a divine
      ability inside it. This liquid functions as a potion or oil.</p>

      <p>If you do not have the ability to grant divine or sense effects to
      other creatures, the instilled liquid is only usable by you. An instilled
      liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell points. If you have
      equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost of bottles and water
      is considered negligible.</p>

      <p>You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion.
      All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must
      be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill
      multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids
      with a single action.</p>
