    value: >
      <p>When the recipient of your Mystical Bond casts a sphere effect, you
      may, as a free action that can be taken outside of your turn, end your
      Mystical Bond in order to empower or hinder that spellcasting, applying
      double the effect of Mystical Bond for that specific casting.</p>

      <p>The use of this talent allows your Mystical Bond to reduce the caster
      level of a sphere effect to below 1. If this reduces the ability to a
      caster level below 0, the manifested ability fails and any spell points
      used are lost.</p>
