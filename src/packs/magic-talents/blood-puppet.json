      "value": "<p>You may spend a spell point to use blood control to take control of the target&#8217;s body. For 1 round per caster level or until the blood control ends (whichever comes first), you can concentrate on the target, spending an action to force the target&#8217;s body to take the same type of action, acting on simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The puppetted creature&#8217;s body is under your control, but the creature&#8217;s mind is not. Creatures capable of taking purely mental actions can still do so. If you spend at least a standard action controlling the puppet, this counts as concentrating on the blood control. A creature under the effects of this ability cannot take physical action on its own; treat this as being dazed, though immunity to and bonuses on saving throws against the dazed condition does not apply. The target may be forced to take harmful actions. A target forced to hurt or kill itself deals its weapon damage + its Strength modifier to itself per round as a standard action. The target may still perform mental-only actions while under the effects of Blood Puppet (such as attempting to end the blood control). This ability does not grant access to the target&#8217;s memories, thoughts, casting, supernatural, or spelllike abilities, nor is your control fine enough to force the target to speak intelligibly.</p>\n<p>Effects such as the protection from evil spell or the Hallow word of the Fate sphere do not end this effect, since it is the result of a physical malady rather than a mind-affecting or possession effect.</p>\n<p>If you possess Mass Blood Magic, you may take control and command multiple puppets, but must divide a single round&#8217;s worth of actions between all puppets.</p>\n",
