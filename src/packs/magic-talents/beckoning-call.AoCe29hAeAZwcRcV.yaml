      <p>You gain the ability to, as a standard action, sing, speak, or dance in
      such a manner as to cause any creature of one non-fey specific form of
      creature (humans, rats, orcs, birds, etc., chosen when this fey-blessing
      is activated) within 60 feet who can see and hear you to become fascinated
      with you (Will negates). A creature that successfully saves cannot be
      targeted with your beckoning call for 24 hours. If a creature fails its
      saving throw, it approaches to sit before you, and follows you if you
      move, so long as you take a standard action each round to maintain the
      effect. As normal, fascinated creatures suffer a -4 penalty to Perception,
      but cease to be fascinated if attacked or approached with an obviously
      hostile intent, such as someone drawing a weapon. This is a mind-affecting
      effect.</p>
