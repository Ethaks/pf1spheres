      "value": "<p>You may cause a location or object to radiate a cloud that invites or repels either creatures of a given type (such as monstrous humanoids or outsiders with the fire subtype), a specific kind of creature (such as blue dragons or red-furred hobgoblins), or creatures of a specific alignment (such as lawful neutral creatures).</p>\n<p>If the effect is used to invite creatures, they feel elated and pleased to be in the area of the effect, or desire to touch or possess the affected item. They have an overpowering desire to stay in the area or remain in contact with the item. If the effect is used to repel creatures, they feel an urge to leave the area or avoid the object in question. The creatures will actively shun the area and not willingly return to it while the talent&#8217;s effect is active.</p>\n<p>If a save to resist the invitation effect is successful, the creature is unaffected, but they must reattempt the save after 1d6 x 10 minutes if they are still within range and the effect is still continuing.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesser Cloud:</strong> The lure effect can invite or repel creatures of up to 1/2 your caster level in Hit Dice (Will negates). The effect applies to any creature who comes within close range of the effect. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Cloud:</strong> As the lesser cloud, except it can affect creatures of up to your caster level in Hit Dice, applies to any creature who comes within medium range of the effect, and lasts for a number of hours equal to your caster level.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Cloud:</strong> As the lesser cloud, except the lure effects creatures of up to twice your caster level in Hit Dice, applies to any creature who comes within long range of the effect, and lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. Casters with the Ranged Mind talent may extend the range to extreme range (1,000 feet + 100 feet per level). Casters with both the Ranged Mind talent and the Zeitgeist advanced talent may make the lure&#8217;s effect cover either 1 mile/caster level, or communities of up to 10,000 or smaller.</p>\n",
