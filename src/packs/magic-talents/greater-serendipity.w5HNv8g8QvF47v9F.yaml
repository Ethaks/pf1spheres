      <p>When you use your Serendipity consecration, in addition to bestowing a
      luck bonus upon your allies, all enemies within the area of effect also
      suffer a penalty to their own attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks,
      and saving throws equal to the bonus you grant to your allies. When used
      this way, serendipity is considered a curse effect on your enemies.</p>
