      <p>You inspire competence in the target.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> As an immediate action, you may add a +2
      competence bonus to a skill check or attack roll the target has just made.
      This can change a failure into a success. You must choose to use this
      charm after the roll has been made, but before the results are
      revealed.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> This is the same as the lesser charm,
      except it adds +2d4 to the attack roll or skill check instead of +2.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This is the same as the greater charm,
      except it adds +2d4 + 1 per 2 caster levels (minimum 1) to the roll
      instead of only +2d4.</p>
