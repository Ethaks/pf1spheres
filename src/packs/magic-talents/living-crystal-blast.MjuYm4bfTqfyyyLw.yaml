      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a living crystal blast, covering
      the target and their space in a mass of ever shifting and clinging
      crystals. Your destructive blast deals piercing damage. Any creature
      struck by the attack or that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was
      required must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and unable to
      move.</p>

      <p>In addition, the target&#8217;s square (or the blast&#8217;s affected
      area) becomes overgrown with living crystal. Any creature entering an
      affected square must succeed at a Reflex save or become entangled and
      unable to move. Breaking free of the entangled condition is a move action,
      requiring either a Strength check or an Escape Artist check against the
      living crystal blast&#8217;s save DC. A target may also destroy the
      crystal on a creature by dealing 3 damage per caster level to the crystal.
      This removes the entangled condition from the creature. The crystal
      disappears after 1 minute.</p>
