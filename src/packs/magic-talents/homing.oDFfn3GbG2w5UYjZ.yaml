    value: >
      <p>When you miss with a Bludgeon attack, you may spend a spell point as an
      immediate action to make the Bludgeon home back in on the target. For a
      number of rounds equal to your caster level the object single-mindedly
      moves towards the target without you needing to concentrate on it, taking
      the shortest path as it attempts to attack them each turn. A Bludgeon
      directed this way can only make one attack per turn, and once it makes a
      single successful attack it stops pursuing the target and drops to the
      ground unless you begin concentrating on it again. If you possess the
      Divided Mind talent you may pay a single spell point to make multiple
      objects pursue a target, but as soon as any one of them makes a successful
      attack, they all stop pursuing.</p>
