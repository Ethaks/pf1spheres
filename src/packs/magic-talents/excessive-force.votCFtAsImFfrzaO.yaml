      <p>Whenever you could perform a Bludgeon as part of a standard action or
      greater, you may instead violently slam the target under your telekinesis
      into another object or against a surface (such as a wall or floor). The
      target takes damage appropriate to its size, as though used as a Bludgeon,
      plus an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 2 caster levels and must
      succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone from the force of the impact. The
      impacted object or surface takes the damage appropriate to the
      target&#8217;s size but does not take any additional damage from this
      effect.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Acceleration talent, you may choose to have the
      impacted object or surface also take this effect&#8217;s additional damage
      (in addition to the Bludgeon&#8217;s damage). In addition, you may use
      this talent when performing a single Bludgeon as part of a standard action
      or greater. Instead of making an attack roll, both the Bludgeon and the
      target must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage appropriate to the
      Bludgeon&#8217;s size plus this effect&#8217;s additional damage and fall
      prone.</p>

      <p>Using this talent ends your telekinesis on the creature or object used
      to perform the Bludgeon.</p>
