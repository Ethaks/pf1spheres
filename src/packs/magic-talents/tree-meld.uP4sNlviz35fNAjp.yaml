      <p>You gain the ability to, as a standard action, meld your form and up to
      100 lbs. of gear into a tree. Unmelding is as easy as using a move action
      to leave the tree&#8217;s space. The tree must be large enough to
      accommodate you and your gear. You may hear (but not see nor benefit from
      other special senses) what happens around the tree, and while minor
      physical damage to the tree does not harm you, any partial or complete
      destruction of the tree (to the extent that you no longer fit within it)
      expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage.</p>

      <p>You may still use magic while within the tree, although all effects
      must target yourself or your held equipment. So long as you are within a
      tree, you gain fast healing 1 and do not need to breathe, eat or drink.
      You are not automatically expelled from the tree when your fey-link
      expires and may unmeld when you desire.</p>
