      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Cosmic Form:</strong> The target&#8217;s body becomes only
      semi-corporeal, appearing as a mass of starstuff or lights congealed into
      a form, rather than a form made from flesh. The target gains a deflection
      bonus to AC equal to 1/4th their Hit Dice, rounded down.</p>

      <p><strong>Spirit&#8217;s Reach:</strong> The target&#8217;s limbs become
      able to project themselves further than their physical confines. When
      making an attack action using a natural weapon, delivering a touch attack,
      performing skill checks, or manipulating objects (such as picking up
      unattended objects, throwing switches, or dropping objects), the
      target&#8217;s reach increases by 5 feet + 5 feet for every 10 caster
      levels you possess. The target does not threaten this area.</p>

      <p><strong>Shadow Blend:</strong> At 5th caster level, you may make the
      target murky, giving it concealment (20% miss chance) even when in normal
      light. This does not work in bright light.</p>

      <p><strong>Spiritual Touch:</strong> At 6th caster level, you may cause
      the target&#8217;s weapons and natural weapons to all be treated as though
      they had the ghost touch weapon special ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Ethereal:</strong> At 15th caster level, you may make the
      target ethereal. This costs an additional spell point.</p>
