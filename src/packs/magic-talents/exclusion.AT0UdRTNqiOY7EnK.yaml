    value: >
      <p>You can create a ward that prevents entry of a common material or
      element chosen when you create the ward. You may choose an element based
      on their physical material (such as stone, metal, water, or acid), form of
      energy (such as fire or light) or based on their physical properties (such
      as poisonous materials or living materials). Magical and non-magical
      materials excluded have great difficulty entering the ward, but are
      unaffected once inside.</p>

      <p>Creatures made of or carrying the material with them must succeed at a
      Strength check against a DC equal to your Protection sphere DC to cross
      the threshold of the ward, or they can simply drop any of the warded
      material they are carrying. An attack from outside the ward that crosses
      into the ward and is composed of the offending material receives a penalty
      to attack equal to your caster level.</p>
