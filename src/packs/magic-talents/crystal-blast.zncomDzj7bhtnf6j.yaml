    value: >
      <p>Your destructive blast becomes an explosion of crystal, growing where
      it strikes. A crystal blast uses d4 instead of d6 as its damage die and
      deals piercing damage. Any creature struck by the attack or that failed
      their Reflex saving throw if one was required must succeed at a Reflex
      save or be entangled and unable to move. In addition, the target&#8217;s
      square (or the blast&#8217;s affected area) becomes overgrown with crystal
      and counts as difficult terrain. Breaking free of the entangled condition
      is a move action, requiring either a Strength check or an Escape Artist
      check against the crystal blast&#8217;s save DC. A target may also destroy
      the crystal on a square or creature by dealing 3 damage per caster level
      to the crystal. This removes the entangled condition from the creature and
      destroys the difficult terrain. Crystal disappears after 1 minute.</p>
