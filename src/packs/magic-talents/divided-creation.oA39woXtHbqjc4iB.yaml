      <p>When creating an object, you may instead create multiple objects within
      range. Each created object must be of the same general type (suits of
      armor, wall sections, catapults, etc.), and the total size of all created
      objects cannot exceed your maximum creation size. Alternatively, you may
      create a single &#8216;object&#8217; that would normally consist of a
      multitude of parts (i.e., if creating a tavern with this talent, it would
      appear with chairs, beds, barrels, etc.).</p>

      <p>Just as two Small objects counts as a Medium object and two Medium
      objects counts as a Large object, two Tiny objects count as a Small
      object, two Diminutive objects count as a Tiny object, etc. You may drop
      multiple objects as an attack, but each object must target a different
      square (up to 4 objects that are Tiny or smaller can target a single
      square, but any attack roll is done once for each object). A creature may
      be targeted only by as many falling objects as could target any square or
      squares the creature occupies.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may attempt to drop enough small objects to bury a
      target, creating a cave-in or a similar effect on top of them. This deals
      damage as normal for a single falling object of whatever material is
      chosen, but also has the chance of burying the target as if the dropped
      material were a soft material such as cloth.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Creation sphere can target larger
      creatures with more objects than smaller ones, but this has always been
      viewed as an abuse of the sphere's effects for the "sake of realism". GMs
      should heavily consider limiting the number of objects which can target a
      single creature to 4 objects, regardless of the creatures actual size.
      Larger creatures should not be taking unusually larger amounts of damage
      than a smaller foe would under the same circumstances.</p>

      <p>GMs may consider allowing Creation sphere to use the rules as written
      use of Divided Creation, but treat the interaction as though it were an
      advanced talent, understanding that allowing this interaction greatly
      increases Creation sphere's damage against a single large target.</p>
