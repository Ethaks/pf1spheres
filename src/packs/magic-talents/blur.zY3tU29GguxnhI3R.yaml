      <p>As a trick you may designate a single 5-foot cube as a figment that
      distorts perception. This distortion lasts for one round per caster level.
      Any effect originating from a source whose line of sight begins inside or
      crosses this area incurs a 20% miss chance + 5% per caster level (maximum
      50%) due to concealment. Any creature may attempt a Will save as a free
      action once per round to ignore this miss chance for 1 round. You may only
      have one such disruption at a time. Using this trick a second time
      immediately end the duration of the previous casting of this trick.</p>

      <p>As an illusion you may create a distorting figment. This creates a
      figment that causes a distortion as described above.</p>

      <p>As an illusion you may create a distorting glamer. This functions in
      all other ways as the trick except it does not allow for a Will save to
      ignore the miss chance and has the duration of a standard illusion. As a
      glamer, the miss chance only applies to attacks made against the
      target.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Blurs created with this talent do not
      need to be visual, or purely visual; They can incorporate elements that
      distort other forms of perception based upon what (sensory) talents you
      possess. A creature can ignore the miss chance granted by blur if they
      lack senses for every (sensory) effect you incorporate into the effect; A
      purely visual blur can have its miss chance ignored by a creature that
      closes its eyes. To determine if a sense is sufficiently possessed by a
      creature when determining if they can ignore the miss chance provided by
      the blur effect, they must be capable of pin-pointing the space of a
      creature only using that sense; For example, humans do not normally
      qualify as possessing the necessary senses to pin-point a creature by
      smell or taste alone (unless they gain other senses such as scent, keen
      scent, or some forms of blindsense).</p>
