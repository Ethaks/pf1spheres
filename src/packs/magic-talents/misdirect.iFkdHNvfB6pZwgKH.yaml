      <p>You imbue an area to persuade travelers to wander elsewhere.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Cloud:</strong> A creature entering the cloud must
      succeed on a Will save. Failure causes them to, potentially, change
      directions. Roll a d8 as if throwing a splash weapon that missed its
      target square; on a 1, the creature continues moving in its intended
      direction. On a 2 through 8, count around the target creature&#8217;s
      adjacent squares in a clockwise direction to determine the direction it
      walks in. It finishes moving after the intended distance has been
      traversed, or after it moves into an obstruction (such as a wall). If it
      was moving faster than its typical movement speed (such as by running) the
      creature takes 1d4 nonlethal damage. This cloud lasts for one minute per
      caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Cloud:</strong> As the lesser cloud, but you determine
      the new direction of travel when imbuing the area with the cloud and may
      select a number of familiar creatures equal to your casting ability
      modifier to be immune to the cloud&#8217;s effects.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Cloud:</strong> As the greater cloud, but you may
      alter the direction of every target moving through the cloud as a free
      action as long as you remain within close range of the cloud.</p>
