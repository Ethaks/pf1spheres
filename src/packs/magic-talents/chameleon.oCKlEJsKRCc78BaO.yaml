      <p>You can cause light and color to shift around a target, granting it the
      ability to blend in with its surroundings. The target gains a circumstance
      bonus to Stealth checks equal to your casting ability modifier. This does
      not stack with bonuses from invisibility. An object hidden in this way
      requires a Perception check to notice (DC 10 + the object&#8217;s size
      modifier + your casting ability modifier). In addition, the target gains
      the ability to hide even while being observed, though the target cannot
      move more than 5 feet each round to use this benefit.</p>
