      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend three spell points to place a word on a creature that
      protects it from a single doom. Choose a set of circumstances. If the
      circumstances would kill the target of this word the target is instead
      left at 1 hit point and the word ends. In order for this word to function,
      the circumstances must be sufficiently specific. For example, &#8220;death
      at the hands of an orc,&#8221; &#8220;death in an ambush,&#8221;
      &#8220;death by fire,&#8221; or &#8220;death caused by the Telekinesis
      sphere&#8221; would be acceptable; &#8220;death by hit point damage&#8221;
      or &#8220;death at the hands of an enemy&#8221; would not.</p>

      <p>The GM is the ultimate arbiter both of what is sufficiently specific
      (though if a set of circumstances is ruled to not be, the caster does not
      spend spell points) and of whether a particular death meets the specified
      conditions.</p>

      <p>This word lasts 1 hour per caster level or until discharged.</p>
