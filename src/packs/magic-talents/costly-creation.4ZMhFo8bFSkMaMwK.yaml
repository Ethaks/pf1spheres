      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Expanded Materials
      (material), Lengthened Creation; (Change Material (alter), Expanded
      Materials (material), Forge (alter), Permanent Change (advanced)) or
      Create Materials (advanced)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 5 additional spell points when using Create Materials or
      Permanent Change to permanently create valuable raw materials, including
      gems, precious metals (such as gold or silver), and rare metals (such as
      cold iron or mithral). When using this talent your caster level is halved
      for determining the quantity of material that can be created.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This talent can be unbalancing for a game, and
      GMs should consider its role in their setting before allowing it to fall
      into player hands. However, if handled correctly, this talent can lead to
      interesting interactions between players and setting. For example, the
      players might flood a market with rare jewels only to find their value
      plummets as the market floods. This applies to the selling of a mass
      amount of mithral or adamantine as well. Also remember that towns have a
      maximum buy value and attempting to sell items that exceed this value
      cannot be done.</p>

      <p>Additionally take note of how this talent could affect the world at
      large outside of PC hands. If many high level Creation casters exist, then
      normally rare materials might be commonplace in the setting, their rarity
      long since diminished by industrious casters, or perhaps the materials are
      not naturally occurring at all and the few mages with the ability to
      create them charge a fortune for their use, keeping their prices high.
      This ultimate secret of Creation might even be passed down only among
      those of a certain order, limiting the talent&#8217;s availability to a
      select few, like medieval guilds, with well guarded, secret recipes whose
      methods could be lost.</p>
