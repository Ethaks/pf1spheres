      <p>Whenever you use a magic sphere effect to successfully inflict ability
      damage, ability drain, or ability score penalties on a target with at
      least half as many Hit Dice as your character level, you may spend 1
      additional spell point to use an Enhancement sphere ability as a swift
      action on any willing creature within range. Conditions such as fatigued,
      grappled or entangled do not trigger this ability. Any penalty imposed by
      an (enhance) talent on an acceptable target can be used to activate this
      talent as if it were ability damage, drain, or an ability penalty.</p>
