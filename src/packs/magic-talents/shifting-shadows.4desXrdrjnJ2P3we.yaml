      <p>As a free action at the beginning of your turn or when you first create
      an area of darkness, you may remove up to one 5-foot square plus an
      additional 5-foot square per 2 caster levels from anywhere within the
      area, and may add one 5-foot square plus an additional 5-foot square per 2
      caster levels to an existing area of darkness, so long as the addition is
      contiguous. At the beginning of each turn, you may change which squares
      are removed or added, but may never add or remove more at one time than
      your caster level would allow.</p>
