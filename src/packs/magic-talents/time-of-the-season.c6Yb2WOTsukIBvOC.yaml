      <p>You create a temporal bubble which changes the season. Create a sphere
      with a radius of 10 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels centered on a
      creature, object, or square within reach (or within your Time sphere
      range, if you possess the Ranged Time talent) and choose one of the
      following seasons:</p>

      <p><strong>Spring:</strong> The area becomes a refreshing spring.
      Additionally, you may spend an additional spell point to make this area
      burst with overgrowth. If you do, the area becomes difficult terrain
      (effects which allow a creature to move normally in natural terrain, such
      as woodland stride, ignore this difficult terrain).</p>

      <p><strong>Summer:</strong> The area becomes a warm summer. Additionally,
      you may spend an additional spell point to make this area cause
      heatstroke. If you do, creatures that enter this area or are inside this
      area at the end of your turn must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4
      nonlethal damage and are fatigued until they recover from this nonlethal
      damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Autumn:</strong> The area becomes a tranquil autumn.
      Additionally, you may spend an additional spell point to make this area
      filled with rustling leaves and a calming rustic scent. If you do,
      creatures that enter this area or are inside this area at the end of your
      turn must succeed at a Will save or be fascinated as long as they remain
      in this area. This is a mind-affecting effect, and creatures who save
      against this effect cannot be fascinated by this sphere effect for 24
      hours.</p>

      <p><strong>Winter:</strong> The area becomes a frosty winter.
      Additionally, you may spend an additional spell point to make the area
      filled with a miniature snowstorm. If you do, the snowstorm obscures all
      sight in this area, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet
      away has concealment and creatures farther away have total
      concealment.</p>

      <p>An unwilling creature targeted by this effect can attempt a Will save
      to negate this effect, and is granted a new saving throw each round as a
      free action. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a
      spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Weather conditions inside this effect&#8217;s
      area are treated as severity 1, generally matching the selected season
      (winter: Cold 1, spring: Heat 1, summer: Heat 1, fall: Cold 1), allowing
      creatures inside the effect&#8217;s radius to ignore current weather
      conditions. Time Of The Season counts as an opposed control weather
      effect, and changing the weather in an area that includes Time Of The
      Season&#8217;s area of effect is treated as opposed casters affecting the
      same weather category. If Time Of The Season&#8217;s caster is successful
      when making a magic skill check in this manner, or an opposed caster is
      unsuccessful, the weather inside Time Of The Season&#8217;s area of effect
      is treated as severity 0. If Time Of The Season&#8217;s caster is
      unsuccessful, or an opposed caster is successful, the weather within Time
      Of The Season&#8217;s area is unaffected and any season&#8217;s additional
      effects (such as spring&#8217;s overgrowth or summer&#8217;s intensified
      heat) are suppressed.</p>
