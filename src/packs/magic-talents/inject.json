      "value": "<p>As part of casting a blood art or blood control, you may increase the casting time by one step (usually a standard to a full-round action) and inflict 1 point of Constitution damage to yourself. If you do, make a melee touch attack or ranged touch attack against a creature within your blood control range, marking them with your blood. If successful, the struck creature is marked by your blood for 1 round per caster level. A marked creature is treated as though it had less than half its maximum hit points remaining for the purpose of the save penalty of any blood control targeting that creature, and your Blood sphere effects targeting the struck creature ignore any spell resistance it possesses. A marked creature can spend a standard action or two move actions to wipe the blood off and end this effect. Immersion in water, heavy rain, or similar effects may also end this effect, subject to GM discretion. When delivering this effect as a melee touch attack, you may hold the charge, and if you possess the Hemokinesis talent, you may hold the charge when using the ranged option.</p>\n<p>If used on a creature that is immune to bleed damage from their creature type, subtype, or a template, you may ignore their immunity to blood control for the duration of this effect, though they do not take the save penalty for being below 1/2 their maximum hit points.</p>\n<p>If you possess Mass Blood Magic, you may target multiple creatures, taking 1 point of Constitution damage and making an attack roll for each target.</p>\n",
