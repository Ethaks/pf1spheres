      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Altitude Immunity:</strong> The target is acclimated to living
      at high altitudes and additionally can treat its altitude zone as one
      lower, +1 lower per 10 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Breathless:</strong> The target may survive without air. The
      target becomes immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled
      poison), can survive underwater, or even in a vacuum (though does not
      provide protection from extreme cold or other conditions that may be
      encountered in such an environment). This does not give immunity to cloud
      or gas attacks that do not require breathing. Granting this trait costs an
      additional spell point.</p>

      <p><strong>Endure Weather:</strong> The target suffers no harm from being
      in a hot or cold environment and can exist comfortably in conditions
      between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (-45 and 60 degrees Celsius)
      without having to attempt Fortitude saves. The creature&#8217;s equipment
      is likewise protected. This trait does not provide any protection from
      fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental
      hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.</p>

      <p><strong>Pressure Immunity:</strong> The target is immune to the
      pressures of the ocean and takes no damage from water pressure.</p>
