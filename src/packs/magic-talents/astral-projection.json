      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Project Spirit (advanced)), caster level 10th.</p>\n<p>When using the Project Spirit advanced Death talent, you may spend an additional spell point to project your spirit into the Astral Plane instead of the Ethereal Plane. You may bring up to 1 additional willing creature per 2 caster levels with you, provided these creatures are linked in a circle with you at the time. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.</p>\n<p>While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically.</p>\n<p>Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. Unlike a regular use of the Project Spirit talent, you and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane in this manner indefinitely, until you either choose to end the effect (which returns you to your body) or it is ended by some outside means. This effect may be dispelled like any other sphere effect by targeting either your astral form or your physical body. Dispelling this effect immediately returns you to your body.</p>\n",
