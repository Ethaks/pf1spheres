    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to create light that repels unwanted
      creatures. Choose one creature type. In the case of humanoids and
      outsiders, you must instead choose one subtype.</p>

      <p>Any creature of this type or subtype within the area of bright light
      must succeed at a Fortitude save or be unable to move closer to the source
      of the light. Affected creatures may move sideways or backwards, but
      cannot move closer, although the source of the light may move closer to
      them. Creatures who succeed at their saving throw but remain within the
      area of bright light must attempt a new saving throw every round to avoid
      being affected.</p>

      <p>If a creature enters this area of bright light (or if the source of
      bright light moves close to them), they must immediately save or be
      affected.</p>
