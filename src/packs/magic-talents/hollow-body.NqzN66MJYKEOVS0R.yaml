      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere.</p>

      <p>Whenever you kill a creature using a Death sphere effect, you may
      choose to leave the body completely intact but empty of a soul. The soul
      passes on, but the body itself remains alive in a catatonic state.
      Mind-affecting effects and abilities such as possession can be used on
      this hollow body as if it were a willing living creature. Hollow bodies
      still require food to survive and become a regular corpse should they die.
      A hollow body that is dominated or possessed functions as if it had been
      given the zombie template (or one of the variant zombies creatable through
      Expanded Necromancy if you possess that talent), save that it lacks undead
      traits and retains the traits of its original creature type. They are
      treated as their original type, not undead, for the resolution of magical
      effects and attacks. Channelling positive energy cannot harm a hollow body
      zombie, for example, nor does negative energy heal it.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Life sphere, you may reanimate a creature as a
      hollow body rather than as a skeleton or zombie.</p>
