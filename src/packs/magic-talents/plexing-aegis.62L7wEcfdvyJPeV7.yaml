      <p>A Plexing aegis offers no specific protection until activated, but at
      any time during its duration you may spend an immediate action to activate
      it, turning it into any aegis you can create. When this occurs, you must
      pay the spell point cost of the new aegis normally. You may activate
      Plexing aegises on multiple creatures with the same action, provided all
      of them are being turned into the same kind of aegis. Once activated, the
      Plexing aegis remains that aegis type for the remainder of its duration.
      The caster level of a Plexing aegis is determined when it is cast and does
      not change once activated.</p>

      <p>A Plexing aegis costs a spell point to create like any other aegis, and
      may be sacrificed to use a succor ability before or after it is activated.
      You may combine this talent with the Mass Aegis talent at the time of its
      casting or to activate multiple Plexing aegises at once, but must pay the
      cost of Mass Aegis for each of these uses.</p>
