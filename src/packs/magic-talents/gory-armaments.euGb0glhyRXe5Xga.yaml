      <p>By suffering blood loss as a free action, you use your blood to create
      any weapon you are proficient with in your hand. Weapons or ammunition
      created by this effect count as masterwork and last for as long as they
      are held or otherwise in your physical possession, but dissipate if they
      leave your possession for more than one round. Weapons created by this
      effect gain a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels you possess
      (maximum +5). Whenever you deal damage to an opponent with a weapon
      created by this talent, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to
      1/2 your caster level (minimum 1) which last for 1 round.</p>

      <p>Weapons which use ammunition (e.g. bows, firearms, or slings) are
      created with basic ammunition ready to be fired by the weapon, and basic
      ammunition may be summoned and automatically loaded into the weapon as a
      free action without suffering blood loss. A double-weapon created with
      this effect must divide its enhancement bonuses between the two ends, but
      you may suffer blood loss a second time when using this talent to have
      each end gain enhancement bonuses independently.</p>

      <p>This ability cannot be used to summon siege weapons or technological
      items, subject to GM permission.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Alteration sphere, you may
      create any one natural attack you could grant as a trait to yourself with
      this talent which lasts until dismissed as a standard action. You may only
      possess one natural attack created this way at any time.</p>
