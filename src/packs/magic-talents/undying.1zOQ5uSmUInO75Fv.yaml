      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere (Deathless (aegis)),
      caster level 7th.</p>

      <p>When you create a Deathless aegis, you may spend an additional spell
      point to create an Undying aegis instead. In addition to the effects of
      the Deathless aegis, the subject is immune to energy drain and any
      negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy.</p>

      <p>This aegis does not remove negative levels that the subject has already
      gained, but it does remove the penalties from negative levels for the
      duration of its effect.</p>

      <p>This aegis does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if
      those attacks might be lethal.</p>
