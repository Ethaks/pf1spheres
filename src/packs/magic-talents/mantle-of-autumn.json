      "value": "<p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>\n<p><strong>Cloak of Leaves:</strong> You may surround yourself in swirling leaves in a 10-foot radius as a move action. This radius increases by 5 feet at 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter. All allied creatures fully within this area gain concealment (attacks against them have a 20% miss chance). If hostile creatures within this area attack creatures outside this area, the targets also have concealment. You may end this effect as a free action. Doing so removes the leaves at the end of your turn but does not end the fey-blessing; you may create and dismiss the cloak of leaves for the duration of the fey-blessing.</p>\n<p><strong>Touch of the Harvest:</strong> You may touch food-producing plants, causing them to sprout food spontaneously. You may touch a plant within your natural reach as a move action. Each plant produces enough food to provide 3 Medium-sized creatures or 1 horse with food for a day. This fey-blessing ends after you touch a number of plants equal to your caster level. This ability requires requires fruit trees, berry bushes, or food crops.</p>\n",
