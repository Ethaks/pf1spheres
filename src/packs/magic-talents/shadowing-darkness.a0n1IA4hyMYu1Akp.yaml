      <p>When creating an area of darkness you can choose to have your darkness
      cling to anyone who passes through it and trail from them like smoke.
      Anyone who leaves the area of your darkness treats areas of bright light
      as areas of dim light and all other light levels as total darkness for the
      purposes of determining concealment when it would not be beneficial to
      them. In addition, they continue to be affected by any (darkness) talents
      as if they were still in an area of your darkness. These lingering effects
      last for one round after a creature leaves an area of your darkness.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may increase the effects of this talent by spending a
      spell point when you create an area of darkness. If you do so, the effects
      of this talent linger for an additional round per two caster levels,
      though a creature can attempt a Reflex save at the end of each of these
      turns as a move action to remove the clinging shadows.</p>
