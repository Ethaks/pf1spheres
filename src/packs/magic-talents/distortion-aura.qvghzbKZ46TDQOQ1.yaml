      <p>When you use a (space) talent which affects an area (such as
      Dimensional Lock, Flex Space, or Looped Space), you may choose to change
      the affected area to a 10-foot radius around you. This radius may be
      increased by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels you possess and follows you
      when you move. If you move so that a creature enters the aura, they are
      affected as if they had entered the area themself.</p>
