    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to momentarily extend time for a target,
      allowing them to take extra care when performing an action. This allows
      the target to take 20 on a single Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check
      without increasing the time required to perform the action, even if stress
      or distractions would normally prevent the target from taking 10 or taking
      20. This may only be used on skill checks that take no more than 1 round
      to perform and begin within one round of this effect being cast. If using
      this ability on yourself and only yourself, you may use this ability as a
      swift action. You cannot use this ability as a swift action in this manner
      if combining it with the Mass Time talent.</p>
