      <p>You may spend a spell point to commune with the elements for 1 minute
      per caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Air: Speak With Clouds:</strong> You gain the Auran language,
      and may speak with clouds of fog or mist. This is not truly accomplished
      with speech, but rather by interacting with the cloud you may learn what
      else has touched it, passed through it, is hidden within it, etc. You can
      tell depth, weight, size, and number of passers-by, but not more detailed
      information.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth: Speak With Stone:</strong> You gain the Terran language,
      and may speak with natural or worked stone. This is not truly accomplished
      through speech, but rather by touching a stone you may learn what else has
      touched it, passed by it, what is hidden underneath it, etc. You can tell
      depth, weight, size, and number of passers-by, but not more detailed
      information.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire: Speak With Fire:</strong> You gain the Ignan language,
      and may speak with fire or smoke. This is not truly accomplished through
      speech, but rather by gazing into the flames and smoke you may learn what
      else has touched it, passed by it, what is responsible for creating it,
      etc. You can tell weight, size, and number of passers-by, but not more
      detailed information.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal: Speak With Metal:</strong> You gain the Aklo language,
      and may speak with natural ore or worked metal. This is not truly
      accomplished through speech, but rather by touching a piece of metal you
      may learn what else has touched it, worn it, passed by it, what is hidden
      inside it, details of its forging, etc. You can tell depth, weight, size,
      and number of passers-by, but not more detailed information.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant: Speak With Plants:</strong> You gain the Sylvan
      language, and may speak with normal plants and plant creatures. You can
      communicate with normal plants and plant creatures and can ask questions
      and receive answers from them. A normal plant&#8217;s sense of its
      surroundings is limited, so it will not be able to give (or recognize)
      detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events
      outside its immediate vicinity.</p>

      <p><strong>Water: Speak With Water:</strong> You gain the Aquan language,
      and may speak with pools or bodies of water. This is not truly
      accomplished through speech, but rather by dipping a limb into the water
      you may learn what else has touched it, passed by it, what is hidden
      inside it, etc. You can tell depth, weight, size, and number of
      passers-by, but not more detailed information. You can speak with both
      fresh or salt bodies of water, and if attempting to converse with
      particularly large bodies of water, such as oceans, you can only acquire
      information from a portion of the body of water, to a maximum distance of
      1000 feet + 100 feet per caster level.</p>
