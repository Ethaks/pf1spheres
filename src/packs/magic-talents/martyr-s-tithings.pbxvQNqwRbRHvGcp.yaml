      <p>Whenever you cause another creature to suffer blood loss, you gain an
      amount of temporary hit points equal to the blood loss for a number of
      rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. Whenever you would take
      blood loss damage, these temporary hit points are lost first.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may infuse another creature with a portion of your
      vitality. As a standard action, you suffer blood loss and grant another
      creature within range temporary hit points equal to twice the blood loss
      plus your casting ability modifier. These temporary hit points last for 1
      minute per caster level. If you spend an additional spell point when
      casting this effect, the target is also healed for an amount of damage
      equal to the number of temporary hit points they receive.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess a Life sphere (vitality)
      talent, granting temporary hit points to another creature with this talent
      is treated as though it were a Life sphere effect for the purposes of
      granting the benefits of a (vitality) talent.</p>
