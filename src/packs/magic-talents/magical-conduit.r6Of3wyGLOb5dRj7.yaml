      <p>You have achieved mastery over opening magical windows between yourself
      and others. You can now create new manabonds as a free action as part of
      casting your other Mana sphere abilities, rather than a swift action.</p>

      <p>In addition, you can now become the host for multiple manabonds (but
      not benefit from being the recipient to multiple). When you spend a swift
      action to concentrate on a manabond, you count it as if you were
      concentrating on all currently active manabonds you have created and
      linked to yourself. You may also spend a spell point as part of creating a
      manabond to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration, although you may still activate effects that otherwise
      require concentrating on the manabond as a swift action.</p>
