      <p>You may send out a tendril of energy to bind your foe to you. Make a
      ranged touch attack against a target within range. If successful, the
      target suffers your destructive blast damage (Fortitude half). You may
      concentrate to maintain this tether each round, or may spend a spell point
      as a free action to allow it to persist for 1 round per caster level
      without concentration.</p>

      <p>Each round a target remains bound by the tether, they suffer its damage
      (Fortitude half). The tether has 10 hit points plus 2 hit points per
      caster level, an AC of 5, hardness equal to 1/2 your caster level, and a
      Break DC equal to the blast&#8217;s DC. Neither you nor the tethered
      target may move further away from each other without first breaking the
      tether (you may dismiss a tether as a free action) or succeeding on a drag
      or reposition combat maneuver, pulling the other along with them. If you
      or the tethered target move closer to each other you may, as a swift
      action, shorten the tether; the new distance between you becomes the new
      length of the tether. You may also lengthen the tether as a swift action,
      but only to your maximum distance. Swarms may not be targeted with this
      blast shape. You cannot have more than one tether active at any one time;
      creating a second tether dismisses the first.</p>
