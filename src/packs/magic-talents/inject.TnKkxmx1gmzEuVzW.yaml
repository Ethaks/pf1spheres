      <p>As part of casting a blood art or blood control, you may increase the
      casting time by one step (usually a standard to a full-round action) and
      inflict 1 point of Constitution damage to yourself. If you do, make a
      melee touch attack or ranged touch attack against a creature within your
      blood control range, marking them with your blood. If successful, the
      struck creature is marked by your blood for 1 round per caster level. A
      marked creature is treated as though it had less than half its maximum hit
      points remaining for the purpose of the save penalty of any blood control
      targeting that creature, and your Blood sphere effects targeting the
      struck creature ignore any spell resistance it possesses. A marked
      creature can spend a standard action or two move actions to wipe the blood
      off and end this effect. Immersion in water, heavy rain, or similar
      effects may also end this effect, subject to GM discretion. When
      delivering this effect as a melee touch attack, you may hold the charge,
      and if you possess the Hemokinesis talent, you may hold the charge when
      using the ranged option.</p>

      <p>If used on a creature that is immune to bleed damage from their
      creature type, subtype, or a template, you may ignore their immunity to
      blood control for the duration of this effect, though they do not take the
      save penalty for being below 1/2 their maximum hit points.</p>

      <p>If you possess Mass Blood Magic, you may target multiple creatures,
      taking 1 point of Constitution damage and making an attack roll for each
      target.</p>
