      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warp sphere (Plane Manipulator
      (space)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 2 spell points to designate a 20-foot radius area
      centered within medium range as being completely immune to
      extradimensional travel. For 1 day per caster level, any attempt within
      this area to cross space or planes (including all Warp sphere effects,
      summoning a companion from the Conjuration sphere, astral projection,
      blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane
      shift, shadow walk, and similar spell-like abilities) instantly fails. A
      dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already
      in ethereal or astral form when it is created, nor does it block
      extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the effect does not
      prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning
      spell.</p>
