      <p>When you use Perception to intentionally search for stimuli (typically
      a move action), you may measure a single aspect of whatever you perceive.
      You may calculate this aspect with perfect accuracy depending on how your
      Perception check compares to the DC to perceive it, requiring higher
      results to estimate from vague or incomplete information (see the table
      below).</p>

      Alternately, you may focus on a target you wish to attack as a standard
      action. This allows you to roll twice on the first attack roll you make
      against them within the next minute and take the better result. If you
      focus again before making such an attack, you lose the benefits of any
      previous focus attempts.<br>
