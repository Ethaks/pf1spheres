      <p>You may bend space around yourself to avert attacks. When you bend
      space against an attack targeted at you, the originator of the attack must
      make a Will save or have their attack veer wide and miss. You must
      normally ready an action to make use of this ability since bending space
      requires a standard action, but you may spend a spell point to use it as
      an immediate action instead.</p>

      <p>When you take the total defense action, you may use this ability as an
      immediate action until the beginning of your next turn without paying a
      spell point.</p>
