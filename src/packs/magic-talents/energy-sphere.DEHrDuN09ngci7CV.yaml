    value: >
      <p>You may shape your destructive blast into a non-instantaneous sphere
      that fills a 5-foot square. Any creature within this space is dealt damage
      from your destructive blast (Reflex negates). This sphere has a 20 feet
      fly speed + 5 feet per 2 caster levels and perfect maneuverability, and
      wind does not affect its course. The sphere has a duration of
      concentration, but you may spend a spell point to increase this duration
      to 1 round per caster level.</p>

      <p>As a move action, you may direct this sphere to move to a new location
      and strike a new target. Your sphere stops to attempt to deal damage
      whenever it enters a space with a creature, and cannot attempt to directly
      damage more than one target in this manner per round. Your sphere has no
      mass and does not impede movement, but creatures moving through its space
      must succeed at a Reflex save or suffer damage. Your sphere must stay
      within your destructive blast range or disappear.</p>
