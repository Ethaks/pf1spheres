    value: >
      <p>Your companion possesses powerful, natural magic. It is considered to
      possess the casting class feature with no casting tradition (natural
      casting) and uses Charisma as its casting ability modifier. Its Charisma
      increases by 1/2 its Hit Dice (minimum +1) and it gains a spell pool equal
      to its Charisma modifier, and a caster level equal to 1/2 its Hit Dice.
      The companion does not gain 2 bonus magic talents like most casters do,
      but may select magic talents with its feats. A companion can never possess
      the Conjuration sphere.</p>
