      <p>You may use your telekinesis to mimic simple tools, such as shovels,
      hammers, or scissors by using your telekinesis as if manipulating an item
      of the appropriate size.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Finesse talent, you may mimic tools associated with
      any of the listed skills, allowing you to Perform without an instrument or
      pick a lock without thieves tools. In addition, if you possess the
      Telekinetic Maneuver talent, when grappling a target you may choose to use
      the tie up grapple action to restrain them with telekinetic force instead
      of a rope.</p>

      <p>A creature successfully tied up this way is bound and helpless, and
      must follow the tie up rules to escape their bonds. This restraining force
      lasts until broken by a successful combat maneuver, until they receive
      help from an outside force as a fullround action, or until you dismiss it.
      A target cannot attempt a Will save to negate the effects of these bonds,
      or a Strength check to break them.</p>

      <p>You may also attack your enemies with pure telekinetic force. You may
      make Bludgeon attacks without an object, dealing bludgeoning or slashing
      damage as a Bludgeon of the size you specify, up to your telekinesis size
      limit. If you possess the Dancing Weapon talent, you may treat this
      Bludgeon attack as if it was made with a weapon you have proficiency with,
      sized up to your telekinesis size limit.</p>
