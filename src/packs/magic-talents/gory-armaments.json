      "value": "<p>By suffering blood loss as a free action, you use your blood to create any weapon you are proficient with in your hand. Weapons or ammunition created by this effect count as masterwork and last for as long as they are held or otherwise in your physical possession, but dissipate if they leave your possession for more than one round. Weapons created by this effect gain a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels you possess (maximum +5). Whenever you deal damage to an opponent with a weapon created by this talent, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1) which last for 1 round.</p>\n<p>Weapons which use ammunition (e.g. bows, firearms, or slings) are created with basic ammunition ready to be fired by the weapon, and basic ammunition may be summoned and automatically loaded into the weapon as a free action without suffering blood loss. A double-weapon created with this effect must divide its enhancement bonuses between the two ends, but you may suffer blood loss a second time when using this talent to have each end gain enhancement bonuses independently.</p>\n<p>This ability cannot be used to summon siege weapons or technological items, subject to GM permission.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Alteration sphere, you may create any one natural attack you could grant as a trait to yourself with this talent which lasts until dismissed as a standard action. You may only possess one natural attack created this way at any time.</p>\n",
