      <p><strong>Limbs:</strong> none<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> No; <strong>Hands:</strong> No<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft. land speed<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> slam (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small,
      +1d4 acid)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +4 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Additional limbs or natural attacks cannot be
      added to this form through traits. The target can move through an area as
      small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space
      when squeezing. The target also gains the Amoeba, Gelatinous Cube, Jelly,
      or Pudding package depending on which ooze or slime is being mimicked. If
      you spend an additional spell point when granting this form, the target
      gains a 25% ability to ignore critical hits and precision damage, which
      increases by 25% per 5 caster levels to a maximum of 100%. This spell
      point also makes the target blind but grants blindsight out to 60 ft.
      (thus negating the blind condition&#8217;s normal penalties) and grants
      immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, visual illusions, and other
      attack forms that rely on sight unless gaining eyes from another
      source.</p>

      <p>The target also gains one of the following packages depending on which
      ooze or slime is being mimicked:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Amoeba:</strong> The target gains a 20 feet swim speed, a 10
      ft. climb speed, and the ability to breathe underwater.</li>

      <li><strong>Gelatinous Cube:</strong> The target is transparent, granting
      a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks that does not stack with
      invisibility. The target also gains resistance to electricity equal to the
      effect&#8217;s caster level.</li>

      <li><strong>Jelly:</strong> The acid damage from the target&#8217;s slam
      only affects organic material and not stone or metal. Unless a creature
      succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution modifier),
      the acid damage affects any clothing and non-metal armor a creature is
      wearing on a successful attack, and also damages any wooden weapon that
      successfully attacks the jelly. This damage bypasses the material&#8217;s
      hardness. The target also gains a resistance to electricity equal to the
      effect&#8217;s caster level.</li>

      <li><strong>Pudding:</strong> The target&#8217;s acid damage only affects
      organic material and not stone or metal, and deals damage to clothing,
      armor, and wooden weapons as described under jellies above. Additionally,
      the target gains a climb speed of 20 feet, and the ability to suction.
      Activating or deactivating suction is a swift action, and as long as it is
      using suction, it moves at half speed, but may climb any surface with
      ease, even inverted ones. Suction also grants a +10 circumstance bonus to
      CMD vs. bull rush, awesome blows, and other attacks and effects that would
      physically move the target.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Ooze Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to
      any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Acidic Body:</strong> The target&#8217;s body is dangerous to
      the touch. The target&#8217;s unarmed strikes or one slam attack (if it
      possesses one) deals +1d4 acid damage, as detailed above under the Ooze
      Transformation. If the target already possesses this acid damage, such as
      through the Ooze Transformation, the damage instead increases by one size
      category (two die sizes).</li>

      <li><strong>Acidic Nature:</strong> The target must possess a
      slime&#8217;s acid damage, either through the Ooze Transformation or the
      acidic body trait, to gain this trait. The target&#8217;s acid only
      affects organic material and not stone or metal, and damages clothing and
      wood, as detailed under jellies above. If the target already possess this
      ability, such as through the jelly or pudding packages above, its acid now
      affects metal and can dissolve metal armor and metal weapons in addition
      to wood and cloth.</li>

      <li><strong>Engulf:</strong> The target must possess the form from Ooze
      Transformation, or else the fluid body trait, to gain this trait. As a
      standard action, the target may move up to its speed and attempt to engulf
      anything in its path. It cannot make other attacks during a round in which
      it engulfs. The creature merely has to move over its opponents, affecting
      as many as it can cover. Targeted creatures can make attacks of
      opportunity against the creature, but if they do so, they are not entitled
      to a saving throw against the engulf attack. Those who do not attempt
      attacks of opportunity can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice +
      Strength modifier) to avoid being engulfed - on a success, they are pushed
      back or aside (target&#8217;s choice) as the creature moves forward.
      Engulfed opponents gain the pinned condition, are in danger of
      suffocating, are trapped within the creature&#8217;s body until they are
      no longer pinned, and take acid damage from the target each round if it
      possesses either the Ooze Transformation or the acidic body trait. An
      engulfed creature may attempt to escape as if escaping a pin.</li>

      <li><strong>Fluid Body:</strong> The target can move through an area as
      small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space
      when squeezing.</li>
