      <p>You point out obvious things the target did wrong, hoping they&#8217;ll
      do better next time.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> For 1 round per caster level, whenever
      the target fails an attack roll, skill check, saving throw, or ability
      check, at the start of the target&#8217;s next turn, the target gains a +1
      morale bonus on their first roll with that type of check for 1 round.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> This functions as the lesser charm,
      except the duration increases to 1 minute per caster level and the bonus
      increases to +1 + 1 per 4 caster levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This functions as the greater charm,
      except the duration increases to 1 hour per caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>What is &#8220;Failure&#8221;:</strong> For the purposes of
      this talent, a failure occurs when an action or roll that carried real
      risk does not succeed; most checks made in combat can fail, but a target
      of this sphere effect cannot perform simple skill checks in hopes of
      failing before attempting a more important check. The GM is the final
      arbiter of which checks are capable of failure.</p>

      <p>Some examples include an attack roll missing a target or provoking an
      attack of opportunity when using the Acrobatics skill to move through an
      enemy&#8217;s threatened area, etc.</p>
