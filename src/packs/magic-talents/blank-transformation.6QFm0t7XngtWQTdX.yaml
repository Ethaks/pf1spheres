      <p>When a creature gains the Alteration sphere, they gain the ability to
      grant the Blank Transformation. Unlike other transformations, the Blank
      Transformation does not change the creature&#8217;s basic makeup. They do
      not gain the +10 bonus to Disguise checks, nor do they lose their
      abilities, equipment, natural attacks, or any other aspect of their
      unaltered form. The Blank Transformation allows a caster to add traits to
      a creature without fundamentally changing the target first.</p>

      <p>As a trait, you may change the target&#8217;s cosmetic appearance. This
      could include changing the target&#8217;s apparent age, making an elf into
      an orc, adding a purely cosmetic tail, disguising a large dog as a small
      pony, changing a male into a female, or some other such alteration. This
      grants the target a +10 bonus to Disguise checks. This trait may only be
      applied to the Blank Transformation, as such changes are assumed with
      other forms.</p>

      <h5 id="toc2"><span>Note: Legs</span></h5>

      <p>Creatures without legs are immune to being tripped. Creatures with 4 or
      more legs gain a +4 bonus to their CMD vs. trip for each pair of legs
      beyond the first, and are treated as quadrupeds for the purpose of their
      carrying capacity.</p>

      <h3 id="toc3"><span>Creature Types and Alteration Talents</span></h3>

      <p>While assuming a creature&#8217;s form with the Alteration sphere
      generally does not cause the transformed creature to change their creature
      type or subtype, sometimes various abilities require correlating creature
      types and subtypes to their respective talents. The table below connects
      various creature types to the appropriate talent. In the case of the
      animal and magical beast types, general descriptions of their forms are
      used to better match the available talents. Note that there may be
      specific cases where an unusual creature fits poorly with the form granted
      by the talent corresponding to its type. In these cases it is up to the GM
      to discern the most suitable talent.</p>
