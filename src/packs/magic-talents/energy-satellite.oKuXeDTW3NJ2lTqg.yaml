      <p>You may spend 1 spell point to form your destructive blast into 1
      satellite that orbits your body that lasts for one minute per caster level
      or until discharged. This cannot be combined with Gather Energy or
      spending a spell point to increase the destructive blast&#8217;s damage.
      You may maintain 1 satellite at a time + 1 additional satellite per 10
      caster levels. You may increase the casting time when using this (blast
      shape) by 1 step in order to form multiple satellites (up to your normal
      maximum). You may select different (blast types) for each satellite formed
      this way, spending any additional spell points or costs required.</p>

      <p>As an immediate action, you may discharge a single satellite, targeting
      any creature within 5 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels to deal your
      destructive blast damage (Reflex half).</p>
