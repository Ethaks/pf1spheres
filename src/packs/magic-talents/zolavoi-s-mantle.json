      "value": "<p>You may activate the following abilities as fey-blessings:</p>\n<p><strong>Cindercloud:</strong> You may exude a cloud of smoke and embers in a 10-foot radius as a move action. This radius increases by 5 feet at 5th caster level and every 5 caster levels thereafter. All creatures fully within this area gain concealment (attacks against them have a 20% miss chance). If creatures within this area attack creatures outside this area, the targets also have concealment.</p>\n<p>Any creature other than you that enters or starts its turn inside this area takes fire damage equal to your caster level. This damage cannot be taken more than once per round by an individual creature. You may end this effect as a free action. Doing so removes the cloud at the end of your turn but does not end the fey-blessing; you may create and dismiss cinderclouds for the duration of the fey-blessing.</p>\n<p><strong>Sense Object:</strong> You may spend a full-round action to discern the distance and direction to one object that was within your possession for at least 24 hours prior to it leaving your possession within the past 1 day per caster level. You may only target a single object with each activation of this fey-blessing; selecting another object requires spending a spell point and dismisses the previous instance.</p>\n<p><strong>Smokesight:</strong> You can see clearly through ash, fire, and smoke (including the cindercloud ability above) as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring miss chance from these obstructions, up to the normal limits of your vision.</p>\n",
