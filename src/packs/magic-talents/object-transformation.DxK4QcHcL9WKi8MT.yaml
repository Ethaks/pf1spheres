      <p><strong>Limbs:</strong> None<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> No; <strong>Hands:</strong> No<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft. land speed<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> slam (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft. The target gains the
      appearance of a single simple object composed of vegetable matter such as
      wood, hemp, or cotton. The target retains its normal senses.</p>

      <p>If you spend an additional spell point when granting this form, the
      target gains hardness equal to either half your caster level or the
      hardness of the mimicked material, whichever is lower and a 25% ability to
      ignore critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 5
      caster levels to a maximum of 100%.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice. Upon taking it a second time, you gain
      the ability to emulate other materials per Table: Transformation Materials
      (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 234), and to grant the form of complex
      objects. Complex objects, such as those with moving parts, require an
      appropriate Craft check at the object&#8217;s craft DC.</p>

      <p>Failure means the target is not usable as an object. A creature under
      the effect of this talent does not truly become an object, thus is not a
      valid target for the Enhancement sphere Animate Object talent or similar
      effects. A creature that takes the form of a ranged weapon must be
      supplied with ammunition as normal, but is capable of loading and firing
      itself. A creature under the effects of this talent that is used as
      ammunition is not destroyed when used as ammunition, but takes damage
      equal to the damage dealt by the attack it was used for. You cannot create
      a permanent change, such as with the Permanent Transformation talent,
      involving gems, precious metals (such as gold or silver) or rare metals
      (such as cold iron or mithril).</p>

      <p>Object Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply
      to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Construct Plating:</strong> The target gains DR 2/adamantine.
      This improves by 1 per 5 caster levels.</li>

      <li><strong>Freeze:</strong> The target may take 20 without a time
      increase on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as an inanimate
      object that matches its shape. (Requires the form of an object or
      plant)</li>

      <li><strong>Luminescence:</strong> The target may choose to shed light
      from any part of its body, ranging in intensity from a soft glow of a
      candle (shadowy illumination in a 5-foot radius) to the full brightness of
      a torch (bright light in a 20-foot radius and shadowy illumination for an
      additional 20 feet). The target may duplicate any color of light, even
      creating multiple colors, and may cancel or resume use of this ability as
      a free action.</li>

      <li><strong>Material Weapons:</strong> The target&#8217;s unarmed strikes
      and natural weapons are treated as silver and cold iron for the purpose of
      bypassing damage reduction. At 10th level this improves to counting as
      adamantine.</li>

      <li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> The target gains spell resistance
      equal to 10 + caster level. This trait costs an additional spell
      point.</li>

      </ul>
