      <p>You may alter all unattended non-magical objects in a 10-foot radius
      around yourself. You may only affect objects half the size of your usual
      maximum. If you spend a spell point, you may alter objects up to your
      normal size limitation as per your caster level and increase the radius to
      20 feet. You may choose any number of materials that you can create within
      this area to be affected. (For example, you may choose to Destroy a stone
      wall while leaving the wooden dresser resting against it unharmed.)</p>

      <p>If you possess Distant Creation, you may center this effect anywhere
      within range. If you possess Potent Alteration, when spending a spell
      point to alter bigger objects in a larger area, you may alter up to one
      attended and/or magical object for every 4 caster levels you possess that
      remains within the size limitations of the effect in addition to other
      objects in the area.</p>
