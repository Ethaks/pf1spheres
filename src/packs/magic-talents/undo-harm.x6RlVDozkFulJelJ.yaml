    value: >
      <p>While this consecration is in effect, every creature within the area
      regains 5 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level at the beginning of
      their turn, but only up to the amount of damage they have taken since
      their last turn and since you created this consecration. This consecration
      affects all creatures, but you may spend a spell point when you create
      this consecration to make it only affect your allies. If a creature has
      taken enough damage to kill or destroy it, this consecration has no effect
      on them. This stacks with fast healing and, as it is cosmic in origin
      rather than positive energy, affects non-living creatures such as undead
      and constructs. You must concentrate to maintain this consecration, but
      you may spend a spell point as a free action to allow this effect to
      continue for 1 round per caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>If you take this talent a second time you may cause the consecration to
      reverse negative conditions in addition to damage. While this consecration
      is in effect, as an immediate action you may spend a spell point to allow
      any one creature suffering from bleed damage or the blinded, confused,
      dazed, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated,
      panicked, paralyzed, shakened, sickened, or stunned conditions to be cured
      of one of these conditions of their choice at the end of their turn. For
      every 10 caster levels, they may cure one additional condition. This
      effect can only remove effects that have been inflicted since the end of
      the sufferer&#8217;s last turn and since you created this
      consecration.</p>
