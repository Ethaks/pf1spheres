      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere (Geas (advanced, word),
      Greater Geas (advanced)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Your geas gains a permanent duration, as well as a more immediate
      effect. If the target breaks the geas even once, it immediately suffers a
      permanent -8 penalty to all ability scores or another punishment of equal
      strength designated at the time of casting. This punishment may only be
      removed if the geas is removed or at your discretion, whether or not the
      target returns to obeying the geas.</p>
