    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point as a standard action to gain a special
      sense that grants you a +1 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival
      checks. This bonus increases by +1 every 5 caster levels. You may dismiss
      this sense at any time as an immediate action to reroll any failed
      Survival check avoiding natural hazards or getting lost, gaining a bonus
      to the roll equal to that granted by Nature Sense. This stacks with any
      class features with the same name.</p>
