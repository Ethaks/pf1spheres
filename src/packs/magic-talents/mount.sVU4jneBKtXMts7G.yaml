    value: >
      <p>This talent may only be applied to companions with a base form suitable
      to serve as a mount (usually quadruped, serpentine, or vermin, though
      others may be allowed at the GM&#8217;s discretion).</p>

      <p>Your companion always acts on your initiative while you are mounted
      upon it and always appears equipped with a suitable military saddle for
      its form that does not count against its carrying capacity. You may mount
      such a companion as part of casting summon if the companion appears within
      your natural reach. You gain a +1 insight bonus on Ride checks while
      mounted on your companion. This bonus increases by +1 per 5 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>If your companion possesses a burrow speed or the earth glide ability,
      you may travel with it while mounted. This does not grant any ability to
      perceive your surroundings or any ability to breathe while
      underground.</p>
