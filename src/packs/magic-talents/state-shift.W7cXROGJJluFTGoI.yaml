      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Change Material
      (alter)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When using Change Material, you may turn gases, liquids, and solids
      into either of the other two states. If you have Plasma Production you may
      also convert matter into a plasma and vice versa. This is a magical effect
      and the change in form itself has no additional effect on the condition of
      the target object, dealing no damage to it. When turning a solid into a
      liquid or gas the resultant object disperses as normal, but recombines
      when the effect ends and in the same location unless its component parts
      have been collected and moved elsewhere. If all pieces of an object are
      not present, the object still regrows from the largest remaining
      piece.</p>

      <p>If a magical object is converted into a new form, its magical
      properties cannot be used unless they are still applicable to its new
      state of matter.</p>
