      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere, Mind sphere.</p>

      <p>You learn to manipulate the most elusive natural element, the heart.
      You project a 30-foot aura which penalizes hostile actions. All enemies
      within this aura take a -1 penalty on any attack rolls they make. You may
      suppress or resume this ability as a free action. This ability ceases to
      function if you are stunned, paralyzed, unconscious, dead, or otherwise
      incapacitated. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. At caster level
      10, and every 10 thereafter, the radius of this aura increases by 30
      feet.</p>

      <p>If you spend a spell point as a free action, you may empower this aura
      to punish those with wicked hearts for 1 round per caster level. While the
      aura is empowered, whenever a creature taking a penalty from this aura
      deals damage to you or an ally inside this effect&#8217;s radius, that
      creature must make a Will saving throw or take 1d6 nonlethal damage per 4
      caster levels (minimum 1d6). A creature can only take damage from this
      effect once per round; a creature that is immune to nonlethal damage takes
      lethal damage instead.</p>
