      <p>When you use a geomancing or spirit ability that requires
      concentration, the ability continues to maintain itself for 2 rounds after
      you stop concentrating. When you spend a spell point to make a geomancing
      or spirit ability endure without concentration, its duration increases by
      one step (1 round per caster level becomes 1 minute per caster level,
      while 1 minute per caster level becomes 10 minutes per caster level).</p>
