    value: >
      <p>You allow one touched object or creature to interact with other planes
      by spending a spell point. A touched creature can target ethereal and
      incorporeal targets without suffering a 50% miss chance or reduction in
      damage, and can manipulate such targets as if they were material. A
      touched ethereal or incorporeal target gains the ability to interact with
      the world as if it were corporeal in all ways. A touched object gains the
      ghost touch special ability. The effects of this talent last for one hour
      per caster level.</p>
