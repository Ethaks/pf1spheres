      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Death sphere (Corpse Manipulation or
      Killing Curse).</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may target a conscious and willing creature
      with your ghost strike, and they immediately die without any pain or
      discomfort. However, for 1 day per caster level the creature is treated as
      having died for no more than 1 round for the purposes of the Resuscitate
      talent and other spells or abilities that are used to bring creatures back
      from the dead. While this effect lasts, the remains of the dead creature
      do not decay and cannot be reanimated by anyone but you without a
      successful magic skill check made against your MSD.</p>
