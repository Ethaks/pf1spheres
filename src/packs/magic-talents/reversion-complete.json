      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Time sphere (Reversion (advanced)), caster level 15th.</p>\n<p>When using the Reversion talent, you may allow the target to retrain any and all class levels they possess, choosing a new class, feats, spells, skills, or other class options as appropriate. The target of this ability cannot immediately use limited-use powers gained in this fashion that it did not previously have, and must rest to regain any bardic performance rounds, rage rounds, spell points, spell slots, or other limited use abilities granted by these new class levels.</p>\n<h5 id=\"toc42\"><span>Reversion and Complete Reversion</span></h5>\n<p>The Reversion and Complete Reversion talents presented here offer some very flexible options for players in that they both allow for rapid retraining in the event that a player grows dissatisfied with their character, and in that it allows a character to swap to a different build during a short rest (albeit at some expense of character daily resources). While these abilities can be both interesting and useful, they also have the potential to severely impact play at the table if they are not managed wisely. We strongly encourage any character planning on using Reversion or Complete Reversion during play (such as to change from a Symbiat (Chronomancer) to a Fighter (Fracture) when confronted with an opponent who is immune to magic) to have their alternate build put together before they sit down at the table so that they are not trying to rebuild a character while the rest of the party is trying to move forward with the story.</p>\n<p>We also encourage players planning to use this ability on themselves to choose alternate builds that still have access to a spell point pool and the Reversion or Complete Reversion talents in the event they find they enjoyed their previous build more; once a character has trained away their ability to use these talents, they may find that they cannot easily access them again.</p>\n",
