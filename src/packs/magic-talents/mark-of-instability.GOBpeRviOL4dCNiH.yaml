    value: >
      <p>As an expunge, you may force the target to attempt a Fortitude save. If
      they fail this save, they become unable to voluntarily spend spell points
      on any effect for 1 round, plus an additional round at 5th caster level
      and every four caster levels thereafter. Creatures suffering from this
      ability may spend a standard action to attempt another Fortitude save
      against this effect to remove it. This does not stop the target from using
      magical abilities that do not require a spell point to use. This mark can
      be used on undead, constructs and other creatures normally immune to
      Fortitude saves.</p>
