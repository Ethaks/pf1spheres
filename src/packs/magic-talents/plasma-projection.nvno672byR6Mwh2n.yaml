      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Creation sphere (Plasma Production
      (material)), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>When holding any object that could be reasonably used as a hilt or
      wielding a melee weapon you may spend a spell point to create in the space
      above the hilt or alter the weapon into a blade of plasma. The shape of
      the plasma can take any form you wish, but regardless of its form treat
      this weapon as an energy sword (see Equipment section) that you are
      proficient with that lasts for 1 round per caster level without
      concentration. You may spend an additional spell point when this duration
      expires to renew its duration as a free action. This duration can be
      extended by Lengthened Creation as normal. While the effect persists the
      energy blade can be turned off or on again by the wielder as a swift
      action.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point as a swift action each round to
      increase the length and intensity of the &#8216;sword&#8217; for 1 round.
      The sword&#8217;s damage increases by 1d10 (for a Medium energy sword) and
      an additional 1d10 for every 5 caster levels you possess beyond 5th. When
      enlarged in this way, the energy sword may threaten and make attacks at a
      reach of 10 feet or against adjacent targets at no penalty.</p>
