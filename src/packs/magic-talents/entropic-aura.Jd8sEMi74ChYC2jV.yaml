      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, Death sphere, caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point to create a consecration that makes healing
      difficult. All fast healing and regeneration possessed by creatures in the
      area of this consecration is suppressed, and all effects within the area
      that would heal hit point damage or restore ability damage or drain are
      halved. In addition, any damage dealt to creatures in the area (including
      you) is difficult to heal, even after this consecration ends. Half of it
      may be healed normally. The rest cannot be healed naturally (including by
      fast healing). Other effects can heal the damage only if the
      effect&#8217;s originator succeeds on a Heal check against a DC of your
      MSD + your casting ability modifier. This DC increases by 8 unless it is
      made within an area infused with positive energy, such as produced by a
      consecrate spell or ritual.</p>

      <p>You must concentrate to maintain this consecration, but you may spend
      an additional spell point as a free action to allow this effect to
      continue for 1 round per caster level without concentration.</p>
