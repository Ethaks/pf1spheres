      <p>You may create bright light that covers an area in confusing colors and
      designs. All squares in the area of this bright light are considered
      difficult terrain.</p>

      <p>By spending a spell point you can make the patterns of the bright light
      even more intricate and confusing. Each round a creature is within the
      area, it must attempt a Will save or fall prone.</p>

      <p>Blind creatures (or creatures that have closed their eyes for at least
      1 round) and creatures that do not rely on sight are immune to the effects
      of this talent.</p>
