      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Conjuration sphere, caster level
      5th.</p>

      <p>When you summon a companion, you may spend an additional spell point to
      have it possess your body rather than materializing in its own form. The
      companion possesses your body as the wraith&#8217;s passive possession or
      active possession class feature with an effective wraith level equal to
      your caster level. They may switch between active and passive possession
      as a swift action. This possession lasts for the duration of the summon
      and can be dismissed as normal. You may take actions to dismiss a
      companion that is possessing you even when you could not normally take
      actions. You may only be possessed by one creature at a time.</p>
