      <p>Your destructive blast creates a pocket of empty space that pulls
      things in, dealing bludgeoning damage. You may make a drag combat maneuver
      as a free action at range against any creature struck by the attack or
      that failed their Reflex saving throw if one was required. Your CMB for
      this check is your caster level + your casting ability modifier, and all
      targets are dragged towards the point of origin of the effect. You do not
      move with the targets of your drag.</p>

      <p>Targets are typically dragged towards the caster, but if using a talent
      such as Explosive Orb, the point of origin is the center of the blast. If
      using Energy Wall, each square of wall is considered the point of origin
      for those who enter that section. If using Guided Strike, you may choose
      which direction to pull the target, even pushing them up or down. A target
      pulled into the ground, or a horizontal surface, is knocked prone if they
      would have continued past the surface.</p>

      <p>If the target is knocked into a solid object, they suffer 1d6
      bludgeoning damage, +1d6 for every 5 feet they would have continued past
      the solid object.</p>

      <p>Gaseous creatures are considered vulnerable to the damage dealt by this
      blast.</p>
