      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, dampening their spirits.
      Any morale bonus affecting the target is suppressed for the duration of
      this talent. If you spend an additional spell point when casting this
      shroud, any morale bonus affecting the target is instead applied as a
      penalty (for example, a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls would become a -1
      penalty).</p>
