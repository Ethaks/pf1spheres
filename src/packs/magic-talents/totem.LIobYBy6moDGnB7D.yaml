      <p>As a standard action, you may place a totem. A totem is an effect on a
      50-foot + 5 feet per 2 caster level radius area centered on you, but does
      not move as you do (if a totem is created entirely on top of a vehicle, it
      will move with that vehicle but only extend to the edge of the
      vehicle&#8217;s space). Creatures who leave this area lose the effects of
      your totem. You must concentrate to maintain a totem, but may always spend
      a spell point as a free action to allow a totem to remain for 1 minute per
      caster level without concentration.</p>

      <p>You must remain within long range of the center of your totems when
      maintaining them through concentration. If you move beyond this range, the
      totem ends. The effects of a totem are subject to spell resistance.</p>

      <p>When you gain the War sphere, you gain the following totem:</p>
