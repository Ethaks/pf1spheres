      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((plant) package, Create
      Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend 3 spell points to create a massive growth of plantlife.
      This affects up to a 1/2 mile radius area in one of the following
      ways:</p>

      <p><strong>Change Terrain:</strong> You may change the terrain in this
      area to forest or jungle. This does not cause animals native to the forest
      or jungle to appear, nor does it guarantee that the terrain type will stay
      that way indefinitely (some areas such as deserts or high mountains cannot
      support forests or jungles, and a forest or jungle created in these
      locations may die out over time) but in all other ways, the terrain
      changes to the selected type.</p>

      <p><strong>Improve Forest:</strong> If used in an area that already
      contains a forest or jungle, you may cause the area to grow rapidly.
      Typical trees become massive trees, all areas become covered in
      undergrowth, and areas already covered in undergrowth gain heavy
      undergrowth.</p>

      <p>A creature standing in the same square as a typical tree gains partial
      cover, which grants a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus on Reflex
      saves. The presence of a tree does not otherwise affect a creature&#8217;s
      fighting space, because it is assumed that the creature is using the tree
      to its advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4,
      hardness 5, and 150 hit points. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb
      a tree.</p>

      <p>Massive trees take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone
      behind them. They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hit points. Like their
      smaller counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them. Space
      covered with light undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into
      and provides concealment. Undergrowth increases the DC of Acrobatics and
      Stealth checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy
      undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into and provides
      concealment with a 30% miss chance (instead of the usual 20%). It
      increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to
      hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Running and
      charging are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered
      together. Undergrowth and trees are not mutually exclusive; it is common
      for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth.</p>

      <p><strong>Increase Yield:</strong> If used in an area of developed
      farmland, you double the crop production in that area for the rest of the
      harvest season. This has no effect if used in winter or other times when
      crops are not being tended.</p>
