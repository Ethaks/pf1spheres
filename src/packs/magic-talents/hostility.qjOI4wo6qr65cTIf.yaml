      <p>You cause the target to enter a blinding rage.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You compel the target to attack the
      nearest creature on it next turn (Will negates). The target moves until
      this creature is within range and makes at least one attack with a weapon,
      natural attack, or unarmed strike. If no such creature can be reached, the
      target instead deals damage to itself equal to 1d8 + its Strength modifier
      with whatever it has in hand.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> The target enters a rage for 1 round
      per caster level (Will negates if unwilling). The target gains a +2 morale
      bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 bonus to Will saves, and a -2
      penalty to AC. In addition, the target cannot use any spells, nor any
      skills or class features based off of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
      This counts as a barbarian&#8217;s rage, except the target is not fatigued
      at the end.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> Same as the greater charm, but you may
      grant one of the following packages to the target as well:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Heroic Rage:</strong> The target&#8217;s bonus to Strength and
      Constitution increases to +4, and their bonus to Will saves increases to
      +2. The target may still use spells, as well as class features and skills
      based off of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.</li>

      <li><strong>Brutal Rage:</strong> The target is compelled to hostility and
      each round attacks the nearest target to itself, be it friend or foe. If
      the creature cannot attack something during its turn, it deals 1d8 + its
      Strength modifier damage to itself with whatever it has in hand.</li>

      </ul>
