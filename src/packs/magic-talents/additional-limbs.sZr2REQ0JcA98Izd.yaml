      <p>You may apply the following traits to any form. You may grant each
      trait multiple times.</p>

      <p><strong>One extra arm</strong>. This arm does not come with any natural
      attacks nor provide additional attacks, but otherwise are as strong and
      capable as the creature&#8217;s other arms. If the base creature or form
      has no arms, this trait grants two arms the first time it is gained.</p>

      <p><strong>Two secondary arms</strong>. These arms do not come with any
      natural attacks nor provide additional attacks. Secondary arms may hold
      objects, but are not strong enough to be used to hold shields or make
      attacks, nor possess the dexterity needed to fulfill somatic requirements.
      Secondary arms do not count as arms or hands for the purposes of traits
      (or similar effects or abilities) which require arms or hands.</p>

      <p><strong>A prehensile tail</strong>, which may be used to hold objects
      as if it were a hand, and retrieve objects from a belt or pouch as a swift
      action.</p>

      <p><strong>Tail slap natural weapon</strong> (secondary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small, requires tail)</p>

      <p><strong>Stinger natural weapon</strong> (primary, 1d4 Medium, 1d3
      Small, requires tail)</p>

      <p><strong>A pair of legs.</strong> This grants a 20 feet land speed if
      the target did not possess one. If this is not the form&#8217;s first pair
      of legs, the target gains a +4 CMD bonus against trip attempts. If this
      causes the target to become a quadruped, they gain the related increase to
      carrying capacity and may serve as a mount for creatures smaller than
      itself.</p>

      <p><strong>An extra head.</strong> This extra head does not possess its
      own personality nor natural attacks. For each extra head granted, the
      target gains one of the following benefits, chosen by the caster:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The target gains a +1 bonus to all skill checks.</li>

      <li>The target may treat a two-handed or one-handed weapon as a light
      weapon for the purpose of two-weapon fighting penalties.</li>

      <li>The target cannot be flanked.</li>

      <li>The target gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment
      effects, and gains a new save against such effects 1 round later at the
      same DC to throw off the effect. If the target possesses a similar ability
      already, it may only use one reroll per round per effect.</li>
