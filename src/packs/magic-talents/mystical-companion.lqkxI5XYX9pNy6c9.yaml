    value: >
      <p>Your companion gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy it can
      use to accomplish amazing feats, as the unchained monk class feature. The
      number of points in your companion&#8217;s ki pool is equal to 1/2 his Hit
      Dice + its Wisdom modifier (total minimum 1). As long as it has at least 1
      point in its ki pool, its unarmed strikes and natural attacks are treated
      as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. It may
      take ki powers from the unchained monk list in place of feats, using its
      Hit Dice in place of unchained monk levels for meeting prerequisites.</p>
