      <p>You may spend a spell point to divine the spellcasting capabilities of
      a creature you can see within range, utilizing the chart below. Targeted
      individuals who only have extraordinary and supernatural abilities show up
      as having no spellcasting aura, whereas those who have spherecasting,
      spells, or spell-like abilities show an aura depending on the highest
      effective spell level of an ability they can use. As always, treat a
      spherecaster&#8217;s caster level divided by 2 as their effective spell
      level. You may also attempt a Spellcraft check to discover the
      caster&#8217;s casting tradition, even if they have not produced any
      magical effects for you to observe.</p>

      <p>Multiclass core spellcasting classes only reveal as the highest aura
      between the two. Spherecasters with varying caster levels depending on
      spheres show auras according to their current highest sphere casting
      ability. If you are participating in a setting with other forms of magic
      or spellcasting systems, they are detected as appropriate.</p>
