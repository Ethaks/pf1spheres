      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Enthrall (charm), Mass
      Charm [mass], Powerful Charm, Project Thoughts (charm)), caster level
      10th.</p>

      <p>When you place a powerful Enthrall charm on a target, you may spend an
      extra spell point at the time of casting to create a memetic link between
      you and the target. This link allows the target, if they have access to
      the Mind sphere, enchantment spells, or similar mind-affecting effects, to
      treat both itself and you as the caster of any such mind-affecting effects
      that they produce. All calculations involving caster level, saving throw
      DCs, magic skill checks, and other similar concerns related to the actual
      casting still use the target&#8217;s own casting ability, but you are
      treated as the caster for the purposes of the results. (For example: If
      your target uses the Read Mind charm on another target, you would both
      gain the information gleaned from the secondary target&#8217;s mind.) If
      your target possesses Memetic Link as well, he or she may cede control of
      an Enthrall charm he or she casts to you as well, creating a potential
      chain of enthralled targets, though such a chain may only go as long as
      your casting ability modifier (not counting yourself).</p>
