      <p>You can use your telekinesis to ready yourself for any given situation.
      You may perform any of the following actions as a swift action:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You may draw up to two sheathed weapons or items you are carrying
      (even if it is stored in a backpack or similar container) and put away up
      to two objects you are holding in your hands. In addition, you may don a
      single set of armor or robes and put away any robes or armor you are
      currently wearing, or swap out any number of smaller worn items (such as
      gloves, hats, or rings). Each individual item equipped or put away must
      fall within the size limit of your telekinesis.</li>

      <li>You can call a single unattended object that you can see within 20
      feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels instantly to your hand. The object must
      fall within your telekinesis size limit, and the object must be no more
      than a light load for you.</li>

      <li>You may load a ranged weapon you are wielding that has a reload time
      of a standard action or less. For reload times greater than a standard
      action, the reloading time is reduced by a standard action as it has been
      partially done.</li>

      </ul>
