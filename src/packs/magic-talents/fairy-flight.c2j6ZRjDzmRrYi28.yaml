      <p>You sprout wings (which can appear as insectile, feathered, or made of
      leaves at the caster&#8217;s choice); you take no damage when falling and
      may glide, moving with a speed of 30 feet with maneuverability (poor), but
      falling 1 feet for every 5 feet traveled. At 5th caster level, you gain a
      fly speed of 30 feet with maneuverability (poor). This improves by 5 feet
      and one maneuverability category (to a maximum of perfect) for each 5
      additional caster levels. This is a polymorph effect.</p>
