      <p>Whenever you successfully hit a creature with at least half as many Hit
      Dice as your character level with an attack that requires an attack roll,
      you may spend an additional spell point to use a Life sphere ability as a
      swift action on any willing creature within range. If the attack was a
      critical hit, knocked the target creature unconscious, or reduced the
      enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you may use the Life sphere ability
      without spending the additional spell point required to use this
      talent.</p>
