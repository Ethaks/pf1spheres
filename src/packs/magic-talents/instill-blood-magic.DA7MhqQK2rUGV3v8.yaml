    value: >
      <p>As a standard action you may touch a container of liquid and instill
      either a blood art or your blood control, including one (quicken) or
      (still) talent you possess, which functions as a potion or oil. If
      instilling a blood art, you must suffer blood loss as part of instilling
      the effect, and a creature who consumes the instilled liquid is treated as
      the target of that blood art, suffering blood loss as appropriate. You
      must spend a spell point to allow the blood control to endure without
      concentration.</p>

      <p>An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell
      points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost
      of bottles and water is considered negligible. You may target food but not
      an already-magical item, such as a potion. All spell points must be spent
      and all variables of the sphere effect must be chosen at the time the
      instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill multiple effects in a
      single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids with a single action.
      Instilled liquids can be dispelled and possess an aura as if they were the
      original target of the effect.</p>
