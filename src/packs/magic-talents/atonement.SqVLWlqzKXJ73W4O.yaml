      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>You may act as an intermediary on behalf of your alignment. If you are
      connected to a deity or another source of power, you may also intercede on
      its behalf.</p>

      <p>By spending 2 spell points, you may allow the target to change its
      alignment or make amends for indiscretions in one of the following
      ways:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>If a creature has had its alignment magically changed, atonement
      returns its alignment to its original status at no additional cost.</li>

      <li>A paladin, cleric, druid, or any other caster whose casting tradition
      dictates their power comes from an aligned source may lose their powers
      through indiscretions or alignment changes. You may use this ability to
      restore that character&#8217;s class levels or magic powers. Sometimes you
      or the deity you represent may require the target to undertake a quest,
      make a sacrifice, or perform some other action to prove its desire to
      atone before it can have its power restored in this fashion.</li>

      <li>You grant the creature the chance to instantly change its own
      alignment to match yours. The target may freely choose whether it retains
      its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your
      alignment. No duress, compulsion, or magical influence can force the
      subject to take advantage of the opportunity offered if it is unwilling to
      abandon its old alignment. Unless specified by the GM, this cannot work on
      outsiders or any other creature incapable of changing its alignment
      naturally.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Normally, changing alignment is up to the
      player. This use of atonement offers a method for a character to change
      his or her alignment drastically, suddenly, and definitively.</p>
