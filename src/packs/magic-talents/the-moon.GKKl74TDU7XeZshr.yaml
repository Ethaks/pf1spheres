    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that protects the target&#8217;s subconscious and
      allows them to project their mind onto attackers. The target gains a +2
      insight bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every 10 caster levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect when they are the target of a
      mind-affecting spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or sphere
      effect to force the effect&#8217;s user to attempt a saving throw against
      the effect&#8217;s DC. On a failed save, the target is unaffected by the
      effect, while the effect&#8217;s user suffers the effects of a failed
      save. On a successful save, the target is affected by the effect as
      normal. (If the effect would not normally have a DC, calculate it as if it
      did using the normal rules for that type of effect.)</p>
