      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Protection sphere (Resistance (aegis)),
      caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may grant the target an aegis that makes them undetectable through
      divination magic of any sort. Any magical attempt to gather information on
      the target (including scrying, effects that detect invisibility, detect
      alignment, or even miracle and wish spells when used in a similar manner)
      automatically fails. In the case of scrying that does not directly view
      the bearer of this aegis (such as instead scanning the area they happen to
      be in), the spell or effect works normally, but the creature is not
      detected.</p>
