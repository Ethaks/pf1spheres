      <p>You may spend a spell point to grant the target and up to a heavy load
      of carried equipment the ability to step into one patch of dim light or
      darkness and emerge in another. As a move action, the target may teleport
      up to 30 feet, +10 feet per 5 caster levels. This lasts for 1 hour per
      caster level. Both the location they are in and the location they are
      teleporting to must be within an area of your darkness.</p>
