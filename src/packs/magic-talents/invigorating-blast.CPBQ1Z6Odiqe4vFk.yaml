      <p>You may spend a spell point to have your destructive blast deal
      positive energy damage to non-living creatures using d4 instead of d6 as
      its damage die. Living creatures instead of taking damage gain an equal
      number of temporary hit points (which cannot exceed their maximum hit
      points) which last for 1 hour, but also must succeed at a Fortitude save
      or become dazed for 1 round.</p>
