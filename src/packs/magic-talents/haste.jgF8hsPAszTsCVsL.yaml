    value: >
      <p>You grant the target increased speed. The target gains a +10 feet
      enhancement bonus to all forms of movement, as well as a +1 bonus to
      attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This increases
      by +10 feet per 5 caster levels, and a +1 bonus per 10 caster levels. You
      must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a
      free action to allow it to remain for 1 round per caster level without
      concentration.</p>
