    value: >
      <p>Your cure ability heals an additional 1 hit point per caster level.
      When restoring a target&#8217;s body, the exhausted and nauseated
      conditions are completely removed rather than lessened, and you may
      attempt a magic skill check against the DC of any poison or disease the
      target is suffering from. On a success, this removes that poison or
      disease from the target. This does not reverse damage the target may have
      suffered from the poison or disease (such as ability damage), but it does
      stop the poison or disease from causing any more.</p>
