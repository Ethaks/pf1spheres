      "value": "<p>Creatures under your control have the rhythm of their hearts closely monitored and controlled.</p>\n<p>When a willing creature under the effects of your blood control would be knocked unconscious due to hit point damage, you may allow them to enter a delirious state of consciousness as an immediate action by spending one spell point. The target suffers one bleed damage, is not knocked unconscious, and gains the benefits of the Diehard feat for as long as they suffer from this bleed damage. If the creature already possesses the Diehard feat, they instead are no longer staggered while using the benefits of the feat as long as they suffer from the bleed damage. The bleed damage automatically ends when your blood control ends.</p>\n<p>As a (quicken) ability, you can accelerate bursts of vigor and energy within a creature to tire them out easily. If that creature would receive healing, they instead convert that healing into temporary hit points that remain for 1 minute. The amount of hit points granted is still limited by how much healing the creature could have gained, including limitations such as their maximum health, or heals that cannot heal a creature above half their maximum health. If the creature would gain temporary hit points from a source other than this talent, the duration of those temporary hit points are reduced to 1 round.</p>\n<p>As a (still) ability, you can spend a spell point to temporarily halt the blood flow of a creature in such a way they can still survive. At the start of their turn each round, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or become paralyzed until the start of their next turn. This paralysis lasts until the creature succeeds at the Fortitude save, even if your blood control expires, although the creature gains a +8 bonus on their Fortitude save if you do not have blood control established with them. As long as the creature is paralyzed, they appear dead and no longer require oxygen to survive. A Heal check (DC 20 + your caster level) allows a creature to identify that the creature is still alive.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Inject talent, this ability can be used on an undead creature to grant them a +5 bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks made to disguise or pass off as a living creature. You may also use the Inject talent to permanently infuse a corpse with a pulse as a standard action. Creatures who interact with such a corpse must succeed at a Heal check (DC 20 + your caster level) or believe the corpse is alive, but paralyzed, rather than dead.</p>\n",
