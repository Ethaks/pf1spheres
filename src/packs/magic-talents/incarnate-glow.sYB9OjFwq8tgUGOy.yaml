      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Light sphere (Flicker (light)), caster
      level 15th.</p>

      <p>When using the Flicker (light) talent, you can spend two spell points
      to more completely assimilate the target, turning them into a form
      composed of pure light. In addition to the normal effects of the Flicker
      talent, the target gains the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Immunity to nonmagical attack forms. Even when attacked with magical
      abilities and magic weapons, the target takes only half damage from any
      corporeal source. Corporeal effects that do not deal damage only have a
      50% chance of working. Force effects work on the target normally, and the
      ghost touch special ability can affect the target as if it were
      incorporeal.</li>

      <li>The target loses any natural armor bonus it possesses, but gains a
      deflection bonus equal to your casting ability modifier.</li>

      <li>The target can move in any direction with its base land speed,
      effectively gaining a fly speed with perfect maneuverability. In addition,
      the target passes through water and operates in it as easily as it does in
      air, becomes weightless and cannot fall or take falling damage.</li>

      <li>The target moves silently and cannot be heard with Perception checks
      if it does not wish to be heard. Nonvisual senses such as scent or
      blindsight are ineffective in regards to the target.</li>

      </ul>
