    value: >
      <p>You may store a cure within yourself, allowing you to access that
      healing as needed throughout the day. You spend a spell point and roll the
      damage healed as normal, except rather than healing by the given amount,
      that amount of healing is stored. You may store multiple cures in this
      manner to increase the amount of stored healing, but you cannot store more
      healing within you than 10 x your caster level. Stored healing is lost
      when you rest to recover spell points.</p>

      <p>You may draw on this stored healing to heal targets exactly as if using
      your cure ability, except you do not need to spend a spell point; you may
      choose the amount of healing granted (to a maximum amount equal to your
      stored healing), and any healing granted to a target is subtracted from
      your stored healing.</p>
