    value: >
      <p>When a creature bearing your mantle is in an area of Wind of severity
      level 3 or higher, they gain a 20 feet fly speed (clumsy). For each
      category above severity level 3 the speed increases by 20 feet and the
      maneuverability increases by one step. When using this fly speed (but not
      any other fly speed they might have) they ignore the negative effects of
      wind related to flying, such as being blown away or taking a penalty to
      their Fly checks.</p>
