      <p><strong>Magnetize:</strong> Instantaneous, requires metal. As a
      standard action, you may cause a creature or object within your geomancing
      range consisting mostly of metal whose size is not larger than your
      maximum Recover Ore size to fly towards a creature or object of your
      choice within your geomancing range.</p>

      <p>This can only be used on unattended objects, attended objects from
      willing creatures, or willing creatures consisting mostly of metal. You
      may choose to throw the item harmlessly (in which case it can either be
      caught by the target or else lands in an adjacent square), or you may use
      this as a ranged attack action. This counts as a ranged attack, except you
      must use your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity.</p>

      <p>If successful, you deal either the object&#8217;s &#8216;ore
      damage&#8217;, or if it is a weapon, the weapon&#8217;s damage (arrows and
      bolts with metal tips count as daggers for this purpose, dealing 1d4
      damage). Despite the name of this ability, the target object or creature
      need not be made of metal.</p>

      <p><strong>Recover Ore:</strong> Instantaneous, requires dirt or sand. As
      a standard action, you may create a piece of metal ore by pulling and
      combining particles of metal from the ground. You must spend a spell point
      to use this ability, and must have a large enough piece of earth (sand or
      dirt) to pull the ore from. This piece of ore can be brass, bronze,
      copper, or tin, and the size of the ore recovered depends both on your
      caster level and the square footage of earth you pull from.</p>

      <p>The piece of ore you recover is formed on the ground in an unoccupied
      space within range and can be of any basic shape (a ball, a rod, a sheet,
      even a chair) but cannot be anything complex or with moving parts. You may
      also pull multiple pieces of ore placed in different adjacent squares, so
      long as their combined size does not exceed your maximum, and each piece
      of recovered ore must be of the same type (such as copper or tin). For
      these purposes, 2 Fine-sized pieces of ore equals 1 Diminutive-sized
      piece, etc.</p>

      <p>While this effect is instantaneous and thus cannot be dispelled, ore
      breaks back into particles after 1 hour per caster level. If a piece of
      ore is used as a weapon, it counts as an improvised weapon, dealing either
      bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen at the time of Recovery.
      The damage such a weapon deals is listed as &#8216;ore damage&#8217; in
      the chart below. As always, improvised weapons bestow a -4 penalty to
      attack rolls.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Value of Recovered
      Ore:</span> Ore recovered through the (metal) package from the Nature
      sphere is of poor quality and degrades quickly, making it impossible to
      simply create and sell. However, players who possess a metal-based Craft
      of Profession skill such as Craft (weapons) or Profession (blacksmith) can
      heat and purify this ore to make it workable. This allows such a character
      to attempt Craft or Profession checks to earn a wage even without the
      presence of a market or workshop to work in. Rather than earning money,
      the check instead creates an amount of raw materials equal to that day or
      week&#8217;s wage, which may be sold later or used as raw materials for
      any metal-based crafting.</p>

      <p><strong>Reforge:</strong> Instantaneous, requires metal. As a standard
      action, you may spend a spell point to cause an unattended object (or
      object that you are holding) consisting mostly of metal whose size is not
      larger than your maximum Recover Ore size to be reshaped into a different
      object of the same size. For example, you could reshape a longsword into a
      mace. You may not reshape metal objects into forms with complex moving
      parts.</p>

      <p>If targeting a magical item, the effect is not instantaneous, but lasts
      for only 1 minute before the object reverts to its original form. If
      reshaping a magical item would make it no longer qualify for specific
      enhancements, those enhancements are suppressed for the effect&#8217;s
      duration. Reforge does not function on artifacts.</p>
