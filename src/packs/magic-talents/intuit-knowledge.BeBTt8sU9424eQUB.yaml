      <p>You may spend a spell point as a full-round action to gain temporary
      understanding of a subject. This allows you to use half your caster level
      in place of your ranks in one Knowledge or Profession skill, chosen when
      you use this ability. This effect grants you the ability to use the skill
      as if you were trained, and lasts for 1 hour per caster level. Multiple
      applications of this effect do not stack, the latest effect replaces the
      previous one.</p>
