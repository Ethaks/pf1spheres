      <p>You may grant the form of a spider, insect, or other such creature with
      your shapeshift.<br>

      <strong>Limbs:</strong> 1 head, 6 or 8 legs<br>

      <strong>Speech:</strong> No; <strong>Hands:</strong> No<br>

      <strong>Speed:</strong> 30 ft. land speed and 30 ft. climb speed, both +
      15 ft. per 5 caster levels<br>

      <strong>Natural weapons:</strong> bite (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small)<br>

      <strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster level<br>

      <strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft.</p>

      <p>Vermin Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply
      to any form:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Climb:</strong> The target gains a climb speed, as that
      granted by Vermin Transformation. In addition, the target does not need to
      attempt Climb checks to move across a vertical or horizontal surface (even
      if upside down). If the target already possesses a climb speed, you may
      instead increase the target&#8217;s existing climb speed by +5 feet per 5
      caster levels. [Errata'd in Gravecaller's HB]</li>

      <li><strong>Poison:</strong> One natural attack deals poison on a
      successful attack. (Injury, save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 Hit Dice + Constitution
      modifier, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d2 Con damage, cure 1
      save).</li>

      <li><strong>Web:</strong> Once per minute as a standard action, the
      creature may throw a web, as a net with a 10 feet range increment (total
      range 50 feet), which is effective against targets up to 1 size larger
      than the creature. The Escape Artist or Strength check DC to escape is 10
      + 1/2 the creator&#8217;s Hit Dice + Constitution modifier, with targets
      already caught suffering a -4 penalty. These webs may also be laid as a
      trap (Perception DC 20), covering an area up to 3x larger than the
      creature creating it. A 5-foot section of web has hit points equal to the
      creator&#8217;s Hit Dice and DR 5/-. A creature can move across its own
      web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature
      touching its web. A web may support up to twice the weight of the creating
      creature.</li>
