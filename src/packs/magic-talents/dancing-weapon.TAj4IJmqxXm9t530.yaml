    value: >
      <p>You may add your casting ability modifier to all damage rolls made with
      a Bludgeon. Additionally, your Bludgeons count as either a ranged, thrown,
      or melee weapon under your control, as determined by the caster. A caster
      may change a Bludgeon from one to the other once per round but a single
      Bludgeon cannot count as more than one at the same time. You may make
      attack actions with your Bludgeon, though doing so is not combinable with
      making a full attack, unless using Divided Mind or Mobile Bludgeon. You
      may apply appropriate feats and combat talents such as Power Attack to
      your actions with that Bludgeon, and if treating an object as a melee
      weapon, the Bludgeon has a reach and threatens the area around it as if
      wielded by a creature of the same size as the Bludgeon.</p>

      <p>You are considered to be wielding the weapon for the purpose of making
      attacks of opportunity or flanking, but do not suffer penalties for
      oversized or undersized weapons.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Author's Note:</strong> You cannot use attack actions with
      a full attack using Dancing Weapon. You have the option of one or the
      other.</sup></p>
