      <p>When using an alter time effect that targets creatures, you may spend
      an additional spell point to affect an additional 1 creature per 2 caster
      levels (minimum 1) at the same time. Each target must be within range and
      must be affected by the same alter time effect. Once created, each alter
      time effect is considered a separate sphere effect. Alternatively, you may
      spend an extra spell point to double the size of an alter time effect that
      targets an area.</p>
