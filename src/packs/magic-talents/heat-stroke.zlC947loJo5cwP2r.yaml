      <p>You place this shroud on a target creature, creating a region of
      intense heat that befuddles them. They take a -2 penalty to all
      Intelligence- and Wisdom-based ability checks and skill checks, -1 per 5
      caster levels. Additionally, each round they take nonlethal fire damage
      equal to 1d6 + half your caster level. At 10th level, half of this damage
      becomes lethal.</p>
