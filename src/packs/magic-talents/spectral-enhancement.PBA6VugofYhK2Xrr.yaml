      <p>You may enhance objects, increasing their ability to interact with the
      insubstantial.</p>

      <p>You may enhance an object to be treated as though it were solid to an
      incorporeal creature, allowing an incorporeal creature to manipulate or
      hold the object, but also preventing an incorporeal creature from freely
      passing through the object (such as enhancing a wall or cage to impede a
      ghost). If you would enhance an object to trap an incorporeal creature,
      the creature may attempt a Reflex save to immediately move to the nearest
      unoccupied space outside the object (see Catches, Nets, and Cages in the
      Creation sphere, Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 254). The maximum sized
      object you can affect this way is given on Table: Spectral
      Enhancement.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may enhance a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or as
      many as 50 pieces of ammunition grouped together, granting it either the
      ghost touch special weapon ability or ghost touch special armor ability.
      If you spend an additional spell point, the enhanced equipment gains an
      additional benefit:</p>

      <p>If the enhanced equipment gains the ghost touch special weapon ability,
      the weapon becomes especially potent against undead and incorporeal
      creatures. Undead or incorporeal creatures damaged by the weapon must
      succeed at a Will saving throw or be sickened for 1 round, bypassing any
      immunity to the sickened condition the target may possess.</p>

      <p>If the enhanced equipment gains the ghost touch special armor ability,
      the armor grants the wearer energy resistance to negative energy equal to
      1/2 your caster level and a circumstance bonus on saving throws against
      possession and negative energy effects equal to +2 + 1 per 5 caster levels
      you possess.</p>
