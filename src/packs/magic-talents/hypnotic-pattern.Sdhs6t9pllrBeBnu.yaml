    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point when creating bright light to fascinate
      creatures. All creatures within this area of bright light that can see
      become fascinated (Will negates) for as long as they remain within this
      area of bright light. These targets take no action on their turn but to
      stare into the light, and suffer a -4 penalty to all Perception checks. A
      target is allowed a new saving throw each round to throw off the effect,
      and on a successful save, may make their actions as normal. Once a target
      has saved against this effect, they are immune to the effect for the rest
      of its duration. Hostile action taken against a hypnotized target
      automatically breaks the effect, as if the target had succeeded at their
      saving throw. If the target was already in combat when this ability is
      used, they gain a +2 bonus to their initial saving throw.</p>
