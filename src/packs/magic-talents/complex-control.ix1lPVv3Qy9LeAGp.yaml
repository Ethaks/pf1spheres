      <p>Creatures affected by your blood control may be affected by both
      (quicken) and (still) talents at the same time.</p>

      <p>Whenever the creature would attempt to end the blood control on
      themselves by using a standard action, the creature must instead use a
      mental-only full-round action to end the blood control.</p>

      <p>If you possess Greater Blood Control, you may apply two effects of
      either type instead of just one when using the talent.</p>
