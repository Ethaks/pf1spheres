      "value": "<p>You may spend a spell point to hallow a target for 1 minute per caster level. Choose an end of the alignment spectrum (good, evil, lawful, chaotic); you must choose an alignment that you possess. The target of this word gains a +1 sacred bonus (profane bonus if you are evil; if you are neither good nor evil you must choose whether you grant sacred or profane bonuses with this sphere) to attack rolls, AC, and saving throws made against targets of your opposed alignment (evil for good, lawful for chaotic, etc.). This bonus increases by 1 for every 10 caster levels possessed.</p>\n<p>The target also gains immunity to any spell or sphere effect that possesses or exercises mental control over them (including enchantment charm effects and enchantment compulsion effects), so long as that effect originates from a creature who possesses your opposed alignment. If the target is already under the influence of such an effect, the target is allowed to attempt a new saving throw against the controlling effect. Success means the effect is suppressed for the duration of this word, but resumes when this word expires. This does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or projected spirit), but it does prevent them from controlling the target.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span>Fate Talent Types</span></h3>\n<p>Some talents are marked (word). These grant you additional words of power.</p>\n<p>Some talents are marked (consecration). These grant you additional consecrations.</p>\n",
