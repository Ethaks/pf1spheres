      <p>You gain the following abilities:</p>

      <p>As a (still) effect, whenever the target would move more than half its
      movement, it must attempt an Acrobatics check against your Blood sphere DC
      or immediately fall prone. Additionally, the target cannot take 5-foot
      steps, and suffers a -2 penalty to its CMD against trip, bull rush and
      reposition attempts.</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) effect, the target gains a +10 feet enhancement bonus to
      all movement speeds. This bonus increases by an additional 5 feet every 5
      caster levels you possess. Anytime the target would use this additional
      movement, it also becomes fatigued for 1 round.</p>

      <p>As a (still) effect, the target takes a -2 penalty on Intelligence and
      Wisdom ability checks, concentration checks, and Intelligence- and
      Wisdom-based skill checks for the duration of the blood control. This
      penalty increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels you possess.</p>

      <p>As a (still) effect, the target takes a -2 penalty to its CMD against
      disarm attempts. This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 caster levels you
      possess. You may spend a spell point to also force the target to succeed a
      Fortitude saving throw at the end of each of its turns or immediately drop
      one item it is currently holding. If the target fails this saving throw by
      5 or more, it instead drops all items it is currently holding.</p>
