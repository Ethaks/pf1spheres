      <p>You may deliver enhancements through a melee touch attack. As a
      standard action, you may make a single weapon attack in conjunction with
      making an enhancement. This casting cannot be reduced below a standard
      action, and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless as usual if
      making a ranged attack. If the target is struck by the attack, it is also
      struck by the enhancement. If using a scatter weapon, the enhancement only
      applies to a single target, chosen at the time of attack.</p>
