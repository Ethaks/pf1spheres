      <p>You may treat creatures and items within your area of darkness or
      subject to one of your (shadow) talents as if shielded by a veneer of
      lead, and any attempt to locate them via scrying fails. Divination talents
      benefiting from a single instance of Penetrating Divination may bypass
      Obfuscation with a successful magical skill check. Those benefiting from a
      second instance of Penetrating Divination bypass Obfuscation
      automatically.</p>

      <p>You may take Obfuscation a second time, increasing protection to the
      equivalent of 1 foot of lead. Scrying attempts using a single instance of
      Penetrating Divination automatically fail. Attempts using two instances of
      Penetrating Divination require a magical skill check. Obfuscation does not
      affect the caster&#8217;s own divinations.</p>
