    value: >
      <p>You allow light to partially pass through your target and move in
      strange ways around them, making it difficult to perceive their exact
      position. Once per round when the target is attacked, but before the
      attack is rolled, they can choose to have the attacker roll twice and take
      the lower result. For every ten caster levels you possess you may cause
      this to happen an additional time per round.</p>

      <p>Opponents that rely solely on non-visual senses (such as blindsight) or
      that cannot see the target ignore this penalty.</p>
