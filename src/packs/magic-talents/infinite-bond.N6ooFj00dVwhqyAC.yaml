      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mana sphere (Ranged Mana [range] x2),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Your manabonds no longer have a maximum range when used on willing
      targets, and stays activated so long as the creature is on the same plane
      as you. If the creature you are bonded to leaves the plane you are on or
      vice-versa, the effect expires after 1 minute unless they or you return to
      the same plane within this time limit and you cannot activate or use the
      effects of your manabond unless they or you return to the same plane
      before it expires. If you applied Permanent Bond, the manabond does not
      expire, but still can only be used if you and the recipient are on the
      same plane.</p>
