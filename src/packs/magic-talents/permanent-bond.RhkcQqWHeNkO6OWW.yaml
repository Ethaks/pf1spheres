      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mana sphere (Magical Conduit), caster
      level 10th.</p>

      <p>When you create a manabond, you can spend 3 spell points to increase
      the duration to permanent. If you otherwise would need to concentrate to
      activate the effects of such a manabond, you can instead activate it once
      per turn on your turn as a free action. Unwilling creatures may attempt a
      new save every day at the start of the day, to try and break permanent
      manabonds.</p>

      <p>If a bonded creature moves outside of the range of your manabond, the
      effect deactivates and cannot be used until they are once again within
      range.</p>
