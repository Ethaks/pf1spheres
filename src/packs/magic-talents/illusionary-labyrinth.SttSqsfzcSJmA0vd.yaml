      <p>As a trick, you may choose to perform a reposition maneuver on any
      target within your illusion range using your (caster level + your casting
      modifier -5) in place of your CMB. When creating a figment you may spend
      an additional spell point to require anyone that has failed to disbelieve
      the effect to succeed at an additional Will save when attempting to move
      from or through the area of your figment or immediately end their movement
      and remain in the first space occupied by the figment that they also
      occupied.</p>
