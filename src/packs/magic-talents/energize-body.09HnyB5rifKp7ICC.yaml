    value: >
      <p>You may enhance a target&#8217;s physical resilience. This suppresses
      the fatigued condition or reduces the exhausted condition to fatigued for
      the duration. You may spend a spell point to instead completely suppress
      the exhausted condition for the duration. The target is still considered
      to be suffering those conditions for the purposes of effects that would
      render them fatigued or exhausted. If the target is sleeping, this
      enhancement causes them to immediately wake up.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the target adds your caster level to their Constitution
      score for the purpose of how long it may hold its breath or run before
      attempting Constitution checks. The target also doubling their carrying
      capacity. This multiplier increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels
      possessed (thus becoming x3 at 5th caster level, x4 at 10th caster level,
      etc.).</p>
