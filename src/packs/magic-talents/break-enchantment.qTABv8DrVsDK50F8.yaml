      <p>As a special application of restore, you may spend an additional spell
      point to remove all magic from the target that has a duration instead of
      restoring mind, body, or soul. This may be used against curses including
      cursed equipment, although it does not remove the curse from the equipment
      and instead suppresses the effect long enough for the item to be
      removed.</p>

      <p>Instead of a saving throw, you must succeed at a magic skill check
      against each magical effect in order to remove it. You may choose not to
      remove certain effects if you so desire (for example, you may target only
      harmful effects and not beneficial ones). This counts as using the break
      enchantment or remove curse spell against those spells and effects that
      specify they can only be removed through those spells. This has no effect
      on other instantaneous effects.</p>
