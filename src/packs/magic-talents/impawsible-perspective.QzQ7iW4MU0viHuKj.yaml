      <p>Whenever you create an illusion, you may empower it to be incredibly
      difficult to perceive and disbelieve.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Illusion sphere (Manipulate Aura
      (sensory, magic)), caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>Whenever a creature would disbelieve an illusion you have created and
      declare or inform other creatures that the illusion is an illusion, other
      creatures informed of the illusion&#8217;s nature do not receive an
      automatic saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.</p>

      <p>In addition, if an effect would allow a creature to automatically
      disbelieve an illusion, that effect does not allow the creature to
      automatically see through or overcome the illusion (such as true seeing or
      the Divination sphere True Seeing (sense) advanced talent not
      automatically seeing through a visual illusion). The creature is instead
      automatically granted a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion as though
      they had properly interacted with the illusion. A creature benefiting from
      such an effect only receives a single, automatic saving throw to
      disbelieve for each illusion (such as only receiving a single, automatic
      saving throw against your illusion if observing it with true seeing, and
      must interact and disbelieve it normally should they fail their saving
      throw).</p>
