      <p>Ranged attacks by creatures bearing your mantle take no penalty due to
      wind and can pass through wind wall and similar effects. When a creature
      bearing your mantle is in an area of Wind of severity level 2 or higher,
      they gain a +1 bonus to all ranged weapon attacks. This bonus increases by
      +1 for every 2 severity levels above 2.</p>
