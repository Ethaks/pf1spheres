      <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to cause one target
      creature to fall into a deep, restful slumber for one minute, immediately
      recovering 1 hit point per level and curing 1 point of ability damage for
      each ability score as though resting for 8 hours. Each round the target
      sleeps, they regain 1 hit point + 1 hit point per 3 caster levels (this
      counts as natural healing). If the sleeping target takes damage or another
      creature attempts to wake them as a standard action, the target does not
      automatically awaken, but instead must succeed at a Will save to wake up.
      An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect, and
      on a successful save the creature is staggered for 1 round as they resist
      the urge to curl up and sleep. This is a mind-affecting sleep effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> No, this does not count as a full
      night's rest for any purpose (no refreshing spell points, no healing from
      draining casting damage). It is bearly an appropriate substitute for the
      real thing.</p>
