      "value": "<p><strong>Limbs:</strong> None<br>\n<strong>Speech:</strong> No; <strong>Hands:</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Speed:</strong> 20 ft. land speed<br>\n<strong>Natural weapons:</strong> slam (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small)<br>\n<strong>AC:</strong> +2 natural armor bonus, +1 per 5 caster levels<br>\n<strong>Special:</strong> Darkvision 60 ft. The target gains the appearance of a single simple object composed of vegetable matter such as wood, hemp, or cotton. The target retains its normal senses.</p>\n<p>If you spend an additional spell point when granting this form, the target gains hardness equal to either half your caster level or the hardness of the mimicked material, whichever is lower and a 25% ability to ignore critical hits and precision damage, which increases by 25% per 5 caster levels to a maximum of 100%.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent twice. Upon taking it a second time, you gain the ability to emulate other materials per Table: Transformation Materials (Ultimate Spheres of Power pg. 234), and to grant the form of complex objects. Complex objects, such as those with moving parts, require an appropriate Craft check at the object&#8217;s craft DC.</p>\n<p>Failure means the target is not usable as an object. A creature under the effect of this talent does not truly become an object, thus is not a valid target for the Enhancement sphere Animate Object talent or similar effects. A creature that takes the form of a ranged weapon must be supplied with ammunition as normal, but is capable of loading and firing itself. A creature under the effects of this talent that is used as ammunition is not destroyed when used as ammunition, but takes damage equal to the damage dealt by the attack it was used for. You cannot create a permanent change, such as with the Permanent Transformation talent, involving gems, precious metals (such as gold or silver) or rare metals (such as cold iron or mithril).</p>\n<strong>Table: Transformation Materials</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caster Level</th>\n<th>Material</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>Ice, stone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>Basic metals (iron, steel, copper)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>Precious metals (gold, silver)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>Gems, specialty metals (cold iron, mithril)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>Object Transformation offers the following traits, which you may apply to any form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Construct Plating:</strong> The target gains DR 2/adamantine. This improves by 1 per 5 caster levels.</li>\n<li><strong>Freeze:</strong> The target may take 20 without a time increase on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as an inanimate object that matches its shape. (Requires the form of an object or plant)</li>\n<li><strong>Luminescence:</strong> The target may choose to shed light from any part of its body, ranging in intensity from a soft glow of a candle (shadowy illumination in a 5-foot radius) to the full brightness of a torch (bright light in a 20-foot radius and shadowy illumination for an additional 20 feet). The target may duplicate any color of light, even creating multiple colors, and may cancel or resume use of this ability as a free action.</li>\n<li><strong>Material Weapons:</strong> The target&#8217;s unarmed strikes and natural weapons are treated as silver and cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. At 10th level this improves to counting as adamantine.</li>\n<li><strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> The target gains spell resistance equal to 10 + caster level. This trait costs an additional spell point.</li>\n</ul>\n",
