      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Enhancement sphere (Animate Object (enhance), Bestow Intelligence (enhance)), caster level 10th.</p>\n<p>You may spend 3 spell points and 24 hours to bring a plant, animal, construct, or object to life. This is an instantaneous effect, and as such is a permanent change and cannot be dispelled. This has no effect on a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher.</p>\n<p>This ability may manifest in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You transform a tree into an intelligent animated object, granting it the benefits of your Animate Object and Bestow Intelligence enhancements. The target&#8217;s type changes to magical creature.</li>\n<li>You transform an animal into an awakened animal. The target&#8217;s type changes to magical beast, and its mental ability scores change to 3d6 each. At the GM&#8217;s discretion, the animal may be recreated using whatever character creation rules the campaign has employed.</li>\n<li>You grant life to an empty body. This could be a body created through the Fleshcraft and Create Materials Creation advanced talents or a body crafted from parts of other recently slain bodies sewed together. (Assembly requires a minimum of six different bodies&#8212;one for each limb, the torso including head, and the brain. In some cases, more bodies may be necessary. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are also required.) The target becomes a living 1st level commoner of whatever race its body was crafted to mimic, but may retrain as usual.</li>\n<li>You transform a magical object into an intelligent item with a 10 Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The item must be a permanent magical item (thus scrolls, wands, potions, etc. cannot be enhanced in this way), and the item does not gain any powers automatically; abilities and attribute bonuses must be crafted into the item as usual.</li>\n<li>You transform a construct into a sentient construct. The target's Intelligence changes to 3d6 and its Charisma increases by 2d6. The target gains one language the caster speaks, plus one additional language that the caster knew per point of the target's Intelligence modifier (if positive). At the GM&#8217;s discretion, the construct may be recreated using whatever character creation rules the campaign has employed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Creatures and magic items created in this fashion possess your alignment and can speak one language that you know plus one additional language that you know per point of Intelligence bonus (if any). An animal affected in this manner cannot serve as an animal companion, familiar, or special mount, but it may serve as a cohort if the caster possesses a means for having one.</p>\n<p>With the exception of intelligent items (which follow the intelligent item rules), the affected creature serves you as a faithful companion. However, as it is a living, intelligent being, it will expect good treatment in return (indeed, an animal that was treated harshly before it was enhanced in this way may feel no particular loyalty to the caster at all). A caster may only have one companion of this sort at any one time; if a second creature is awakened, the first remains friendly, but no longer undertakes tasks for the caster unless it is in its own best interests.</p>\n",
