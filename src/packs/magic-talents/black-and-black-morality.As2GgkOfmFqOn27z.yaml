      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dark sphere (Gaze Into The Abyss),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>By spending additional 2 spell points you may empower a blot, darkness,
      or shadow so that the alignments of those within are rendered utterly
      null. Any new spell or effect targeting a creature or object of a
      particular alignment, or with a variable effect determined by alignment,
      automatically fails against targets protected by Black And Black Morality.
      Creatures lose the benefit of alignment-based damage reduction when
      affected by Black And Black Morality. Any ongoing spell or effect
      targeting alignment, such as a paladin&#8217;s smite ability or the
      penalties inflicted by a strongly aligned plane, are suspended for as long
      as the target is protected by Black And Black Morality, but not ended.
      Time spent protected by Black And Black Morality counts against the
      duration of ongoing effects.</p>
