      <p>Choose either animals or vermin. You may take this talent twice to gain
      both options.</p>

      <p>You may spend a spell point as a standard action to cause the chosen
      creature type to treat you as a friend for 1 minute per caster level.
      Indifferent creatures (such as domesticated animals or domesticated
      honeybees) become friendly to you, while unfriendly creatures (such as
      wild animals) become indifferent to you. This means that wild creatures
      will not attack unless provoked, and you may make requests of these
      creatures, provided you may communicate with them (if you cannot
      communicate with a creature, only basic commands such as &#8216;go&#8217;,
      &#8216;come&#8217;, &#8216;fight&#8217;, or &#8216;stay&#8217; may be
      communicated). This has no effect on animals or vermin who are hostile to
      you (such as those already in combat), and a creature with a master (such
      as an animal companion) will still attack if commanded to by its
      master.</p>

      <p>Once during the duration of this ability, you may call the nearest
      animal or vermin (depending on the type chosen when this talent is taken)
      of a particular type you designate to seek you out. The creature&#8217;s
      CR cannot exceed your caster level, though if you choose vermin you may
      summon a swarm with a CR no more than 1/2 your caster level. The creature
      moves toward you under its own power, so the time it takes to arrive
      depends on how close a creature of the desired type is when you cast the
      spell. If there is no animal or vermin of that type capable of reaching
      you within this effect&#8217;s duration, you are aware of this fact.</p>
