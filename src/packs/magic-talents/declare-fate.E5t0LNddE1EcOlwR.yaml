      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 15th.</p>

      <p>You may spend two spell points to place a word on a creature to peer
      into its near future. Each round, at the end of the creature&#8217;s turn,
      the creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or be forced to declare
      all actions that it will take on its next turn and be unable to change
      them. If a declared action would become impossible to perform (such as
      casting a spell on a creature that is no longer within range), that action
      is lost. You are aware of what actions an affected creature intends to
      take.</p>

      <p>This effect lasts as long as you concentrate, but you may always spend
      a spell point to allow the effect to endure for 1 minute per caster level
      without concentration.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This does not affect attacks of
      opportunity, which are normally free actions.</p>
