      <p>Before you teleport yourself or a willing ally, you may designate the
      target&#8217;s current square as a recall point by increasing the casting
      time of your teleport by one step or by spending a spell point. At the end
      of each round, the target may choose to return to the recall point,
      teleporting there without spending an action so long as it is within
      teleport range. The recall point lasts for 1 round per caster level or
      until used, whichever comes first.</p>
