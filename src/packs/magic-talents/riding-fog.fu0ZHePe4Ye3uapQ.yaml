      <p>You may create clouds of fog attached to yourself or to other
      creatures. A fog cloud attached to a creature is called a riding fog. This
      functions as a regular fog and can be dispersed by wind, except that it
      moves with the creature it is attached to, becomes inactive if that
      creature is knocked unconscious and is dispelled if they are killed. The
      fog continues to function if it goes beyond the range of its creator.</p>

      <p>The recipient must be within range of your geomancing. An unwilling
      creature can have a riding fog attached to them as a touch attack; A
      creature is allowed a Will save to prevent having the fog attached to them
      and may attempt another saving throw each round to end the fog. The Break
      Enchantment talent from the Life sphere or a similar effect can dispel the
      riding fog before its natural duration expires. An enemy with a riding fog
      attached to them still receives any saving throws the fog allows to avoid
      being affected. A successful save causes the fog to immediately
      dissipate.</p>

      <p>Spell resistance can prevent a riding fog from being attached to a
      creature. Failing to bypass the intended target&#8217;s spell resistance
      in attempting to attach the fog dispels the fog.</p>
