If you are of chaotic alignment, you may spend a spell point to have your destructive blast deal anarchic damage. You cannot use this blast type if you are of neither alignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Axiomatic damage comes from attacks that are heavily infused with the power of sheer law and carry this orderly power over as a form of harmful energy to chaos-aligned beings. Axiomatic damage deals full damage to incorporeal targets, and deals damage as if the weapon were law-aligned. As it is not a weapon damage type, it automatically bypasses all damage reduction.</p>\n<p>Anarchic damage comes from attacks that are heavily infused with the power of sheer chaos and carry this disorderly power over as a form of harmful energy to law-aligned beings. Anarchic damage deals full damage to incorporeal targets and deals damage as if the weapon were chaos-aligned.
