      <p>You may make someone see things that are not there.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You may alter a creature&#8217;s
      perception of a single creature, object, sound, or effect for 1 round per
      caster level (Will negates). You may alter 1 sense (sight, sound,
      touch/pain, taste, smell); for example, you could make a thief appear to
      be an alley cat, make a scratch appear as a gaping knife wound, or make
      the sound of footsteps seem like the wind. You cannot use this to
      replicate speech or sights and sounds you have never encountered before,
      nor to make something invisible. If used to cover up pain (such as hiding
      the target taking damage) the target gains a +4 bonus to their Will save.
      If the target interacts with the object of their altered perception, they
      are allowed an additional save every round they continue to do so.</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> This functions as the lesser charm,
      except you may affect all 5 senses in relation to the chosen creature,
      object, sound, or effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This functions as the greater charm,
      except you may change the target&#8217;s perception of everything around
      them. This grants the target a new saving throw each round they interact
      with any part of the altered surroundings.</p>
