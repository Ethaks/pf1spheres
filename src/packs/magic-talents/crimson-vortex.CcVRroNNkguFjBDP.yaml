    value: >
      <p>As a standard action you may create a crimson spread with a 5-foot
      radius within your blood control range. Creatures that are in this area
      when it is cast or that start their turn within the area must succeed at a
      Fortitude save or be under the effects of your blood control until the end
      of a turn in which they did not start within the affected area. Select a
      (quicken) or a (still) ability as part of creating this area; you may
      apply the selected ability to the affected creatures. Creatures that
      succeed at a saving throw against blood control while within the vortex
      cannot be affected by that vortex again.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point to increase this radius by +10
      feet increasing by +5 feet at 7th caster level and every 7 levels
      thereafter. This spread does not obscure vision. You do not need to be
      able to see or be aware of the affected creatures, though you are aware of
      any that fail their save. You may use this ability to target swarms. You
      may concentrate to maintain this area, moving it up to 20 feet plus 5 feet
      per 2 caster levels when you concentrate, flying with perfect
      maneuverability.</p>

      <p>If you spend a spell point, the spread instead persists for 1 round per
      caster level and may be moved as a move action.</p>
