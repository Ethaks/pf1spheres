      <p>Enemies within the totem&#8217;s area must attempt a Will save. On a
      failed saving throw, they cannot benefit from morale bonuses so long as
      they remain in the area of the totem. A creature within this totem gets a
      Will saving throw upon first encountering it, and an additional Will
      saving throw at the end of each turn they are affected by it until they
      successfully save.</p>
