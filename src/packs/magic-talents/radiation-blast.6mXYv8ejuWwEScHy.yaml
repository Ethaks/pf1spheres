      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Destruction sphere (any two (blast
      type) talents in the fire blast type group), caster level 5th.</p>

      <p>You may spend two additional spell points to have your destructive
      blast do half fire and half untyped damage. Any creature damaged by the
      attack must succeed at a Fortitude save with your destructive
      blast&#8217;s DC or suffer the effects of low radiation.</p>

      <p>A creature suffering from radiation instead must succeed at a Fortitude
      save with your destructive blast&#8217;s DC or have the level of radiation
      increased by one step, inflicting the new levels primary effect. This
      effect stacks with the effects of lower radiation levels. Saves against
      the secondary effects of the radiation are made at their normal save DCs.
      The target&#8217;s square (or the destructive blast&#8217;s affected area)
      becomes irradiated for 1 minute per caster level. Any creature passing
      through an irradiated square must succeed at a Fortitude save DC 14 or be
      affected by low radiation.</p>

      <p><strong>Radiation</strong><br>

      Radiation is a poison effect, whose initial effect causes Constitution
      drain and secondary effect causes Strength damage. Radiation dangers are
      organized into four categories: low, medium, high, and severe.</p>

      <p><strong>Initial Effect:</strong> Radiation initially deals Constitution
      drain unless the exposed character succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. A
      new saving throw must be attempted to resist radiation&#8217;s initial
      damage each round a victim remains exposed to it.</p>

      <p><strong>Secondary Effect:</strong> Secondary effects from radiation
      deal Strength damage at a much slower rate than most poisons. This
      secondary effect ends only after a character succeeds at two consecutive
      Fortitude saving throws to resist secondary radiation damage. If a
      character has Strength damage equal to his current Strength score, further
      damage dealt a secondary effect is instead Constitution damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Removing Radiation Effects:</strong> All radiation damage is a
      poison effect, and as such it can be removed with any effect that
      neutralizes poison. Ability damage and drain caused by radiation damage
      can be healed normally.</p>
