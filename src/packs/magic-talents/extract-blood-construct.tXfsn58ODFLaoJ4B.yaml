      <p>You may drain the blood of a dead creature within blood control range
      and animate it as a blood construct as a standard action within 1 minute
      per caster level of the creature&#8217;s death. If the creature (or
      creatures) were under the effects of your blood control at the time of
      their death, you may reduce the required time to a swift action. This
      blood construct is of a size according to the below table, but may not be
      larger than one size smaller than the dead creature&#8217;s size.</p>

      <p>Extracted constructs are under your control. While they can be
      dispelled, blood constructs are neither called nor summoned creatures, so
      are not affected by banishment, dismissal, or the Hallow word of the Fate
      sphere. The construct obeys your commands to the best of its ability, even
      harmful or suicidal commands and will generally act to protect you in the
      absence of other commands.</p>

      <p>A blood construct created by this ability persists for as long as you
      concentrate. The construct must be within your blood control range to
      concentrate on it. You may spend a spell point to have the blood construct
      remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. Doing so
      allows the construct to leave your blood control range without any ill
      effects. Lengthened Control increases this duration to 1 hour per caster
      level.</p>

      <p>You may not have more than 2 Hit Dice of blood constructs per caster
      level under your control at the same time; creating additional constructs
      forces you to dismiss existing constructs until the total Hit Dice no
      longer exceed this cap. Temporary increases to caster level (such as from
      implements, boons, or the thaumaturge&#8217;s forbidden lore ability) do
      not increase this cap. Once a blood construct is dismissed or destroyed,
      the blood used can no longer be animated to create another blood
      construct.</p>

      <p>As a move or swift action, you may sacrifice a blood construct under
      your control to heal another one that you control, restoring a number of
      hit points equal to the hit points of the sacrificed construct. Any excess
      hit points beyond the healed construct&#8217;s maximum hit points are
      lost. Both creatures must be within blood control range.</p>

      <p>If you possess Mass Blood Magic, you may target multiple creatures per
      that talent, drawing blood to either create multiple constructs or
      combining the blood into a larger construct, up to the maximum size you
      can create, counting two Small creatures as a Medium creature, two Medium
      creatures as a Large creature, etc. You may increase the size of an
      existing construct under your control by merging smaller constructs with
      it as part of their creation or as a standard action; any ongoing effects
      and damage taken on either construct persist in the larger construct. All
      targets must be within blood control range.</p>
