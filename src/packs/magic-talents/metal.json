      "value": "<p><strong>Magnetize:</strong> Instantaneous, requires metal. As a standard action, you may cause a creature or object within your geomancing range consisting mostly of metal whose size is not larger than your maximum Recover Ore size to fly towards a creature or object of your choice within your geomancing range.</p>\n<p>This can only be used on unattended objects, attended objects from willing creatures, or willing creatures consisting mostly of metal. You may choose to throw the item harmlessly (in which case it can either be caught by the target or else lands in an adjacent square), or you may use this as a ranged attack action. This counts as a ranged attack, except you must use your casting ability modifier in place of Dexterity.</p>\n<p>If successful, you deal either the object&#8217;s &#8216;ore damage&#8217;, or if it is a weapon, the weapon&#8217;s damage (arrows and bolts with metal tips count as daggers for this purpose, dealing 1d4 damage). Despite the name of this ability, the target object or creature need not be made of metal.</p>\n<p><strong>Recover Ore:</strong> Instantaneous, requires dirt or sand. As a standard action, you may create a piece of metal ore by pulling and combining particles of metal from the ground. You must spend a spell point to use this ability, and must have a large enough piece of earth (sand or dirt) to pull the ore from. This piece of ore can be brass, bronze, copper, or tin, and the size of the ore recovered depends both on your caster level and the square footage of earth you pull from.</p>\n<p>The piece of ore you recover is formed on the ground in an unoccupied space within range and can be of any basic shape (a ball, a rod, a sheet, even a chair) but cannot be anything complex or with moving parts. You may also pull multiple pieces of ore placed in different adjacent squares, so long as their combined size does not exceed your maximum, and each piece of recovered ore must be of the same type (such as copper or tin). For these purposes, 2 Fine-sized pieces of ore equals 1 Diminutive-sized piece, etc.</p>\n<p>While this effect is instantaneous and thus cannot be dispelled, ore breaks back into particles after 1 hour per caster level. If a piece of ore is used as a weapon, it counts as an improvised weapon, dealing either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen at the time of Recovery. The damage such a weapon deals is listed as &#8216;ore damage&#8217; in the chart below. As always, improvised weapons bestow a -4 penalty to attack rolls.</p>\n<strong>Table: Metal Types</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Metal</th>\n<th>Hit Points</th>\n<th>Hardness</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass</td>\n<td>20/in. thickness</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bronze</td>\n<td>20/in. thickness</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cold iron</td>\n<td>30/in. thickness</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Copper</td>\n<td>20/in. thickness</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Iron</td>\n<td>30/in. thickness</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lead</td>\n<td>30/in. thickness</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mithral</td>\n<td>30/in. thickness</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Silver</td>\n<td>10/in. thickness</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Steel</td>\n<td>30/in. thickness</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tin</td>\n<td>20/in. thickness</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<strong>Table: Recover Ore</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Minimum Caster Level</th>\n<th>Required Earth to Pull From</th>\n<th>Ore Size Recovered</th>\n<th>Ore Damage</th>\n<th>Ore Weight (maximum)</th>\n<th>Sample Item*</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Fine</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>.8 lbs.</td>\n<td>Lockpick or nail</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Diminutive</td>\n<td>1d2</td>\n<td>1&#160;lb.</td>\n<td>Bolt, dagger, or shuriken</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>10-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Tiny</td>\n<td>1d3</td>\n<td>8 lbs.</td>\n<td>Candelabra, light mace, or shortsword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>25-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n<td>60 lbs.</td>\n<td>Heavy mace, heavy shield, or longsword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>50-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n<td>500 lbs.</td>\n<td>Bed, cage, greatsword or table</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>75-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n<td>4,000 lbs.</td>\n<td>Life-sized statue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>125-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n<td>16 tons</td>\n<td>Wagon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>350-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n<td>125 tons</td>\n<td>Catapult</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>500-ft. cube</td>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n<td>2,500 tons</td>\n<td>Ship</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>*Sample items listed are sized for a Medium-sized creature; modify the object size accordingly for objects sized for smaller or larger creatures.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Value of Recovered Ore:</span> Ore recovered through the (metal) package from the Nature sphere is of poor quality and degrades quickly, making it impossible to simply create and sell. However, players who possess a metal-based Craft of Profession skill such as Craft (weapons) or Profession (blacksmith) can heat and purify this ore to make it workable. This allows such a character to attempt Craft or Profession checks to earn a wage even without the presence of a market or workshop to work in. Rather than earning money, the check instead creates an amount of raw materials equal to that day or week&#8217;s wage, which may be sold later or used as raw materials for any metal-based crafting.</p>\n<p><strong>Reforge:</strong> Instantaneous, requires metal. As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to cause an unattended object (or object that you are holding) consisting mostly of metal whose size is not larger than your maximum Recover Ore size to be reshaped into a different object of the same size. For example, you could reshape a longsword into a mace. You may not reshape metal objects into forms with complex moving parts.</p>\n<p>If targeting a magical item, the effect is not instantaneous, but lasts for only 1 minute before the object reverts to its original form. If reshaping a magical item would make it no longer qualify for specific enhancements, those enhancements are suppressed for the effect&#8217;s duration. Reforge does not function on artifacts.</p>\n",
