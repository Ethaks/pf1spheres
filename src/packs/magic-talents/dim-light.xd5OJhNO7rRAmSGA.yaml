      <p>You cause a target to suffer no ill effects from light. The target of
      this (lens) talent is immune to the negative effects of your glows,
      including the effects of any (light) talents applied to them. It also
      gains no visibility related penalties from your glows, acting as if they
      did not exist in the area. It suffers no penalties from light
      sensitivity.</p>
