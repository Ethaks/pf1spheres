      <p>When you stop a ranged attack with telekinetic Catch, you may
      immediately fling it back at the attacker if they are in range of your
      telekinesis. Resolve this as a standard Bludgeon attack using the object
      you were attacked with. Return may not be used in conjunction with the
      catch field option of Quick Reactions.</p>
