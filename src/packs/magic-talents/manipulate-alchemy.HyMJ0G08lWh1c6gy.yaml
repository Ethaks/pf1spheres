      <p>This talent requires that the target be under the effects of your blood
      control and cannot be used as part of initiating blood control.</p>

      <p>As a (still) ability, as an immediate action, when a creature consumes
      a potion or would be affected by a formulae or poison, you may delay the
      effect of the formulae, potion, or poison for the duration of your blood
      control. You may end this delay as a free action that can be taken even
      when it is not your turn, causing the formulae, potion, or poison to take
      effect immediately. A given creature may only have one effect delayed in
      this manner at a time, plus one additional effect per 10 caster
      levels.</p>

      <p>As a (still) ability, as a swift action, you may slow circulation to
      improve the body&#8217;s ability to resist a poison. If the target is
      affected by a poison with a frequency measured in rounds, the frequency
      instead becomes minutes. If the frequency was measured in minutes, it
      instead becomes hours. These changes do not stack. The save DC of the
      poison is decreased by -2.</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) ability, you may speed circulation to improve the
      potency of a poison in the target&#8217;s system. If the poison had a
      frequency measured in minutes, it is now measured in rounds. If it has a
      frequency measured in rounds, its frequency becomes twice per round and
      the duration is halved. These changes do not stack. The save DC of the
      poison is also increased by +2. This change lasts until for the duration
      of the poison unless dispelled or ended with a (still) talent.</p>

      <p>As a (quicken) ability, as an immediate action, you may attempt to
      force a formulae, potion, or poison out of the target&#8217;s body,
      removing its effects from the target. This requires a magical skill check
      against the formulae or poison&#8217;s save DC or the potion&#8217;s MSD.
      Unwilling targets are allowed a Fortitude save to negate this effect. You
      gain a +2 bonus on this check if the target is suffering bleed damage or
      below one half its maximum hit points.</p>

      <p>This change lasts until for the duration of the poison unless dispelled
      or ended with a (quicken) talent.</p>
