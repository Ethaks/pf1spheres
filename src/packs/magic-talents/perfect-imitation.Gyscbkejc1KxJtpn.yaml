      <p>Your Alteration sphere abilities allow targets to imitate individual
      creatures with which you are familiar. The +10 circumstance bonus on
      Disguise checks provided by the Alteration sphere applies to Disguise
      checks to appear as that specific individual.</p>

      <p>This bonus does not stack with the bonus to Disguise checks from
      similar effects (the disguise self spell, Illusionary Disguise from the
      Illusion sphere, the Realistic Likeness<sup>ARG</sup> feat, etc.). Your
      control is detailed and specific enough to allow you to merge the
      target&#8217;s clothing and armor with their body and replicate the
      appearance of other clothes, armor, and even jewelry. Such articles cannot
      be removed from the creature&#8217;s possession, as they are formed from
      the target&#8217;s body. As usual, merged armor provides no AC and any
      merged equipment cannot be accessed. Additionally, the option to alter a
      target&#8217;s cosmetic appearance with Blank Transformation no longer
      requires a trait if not assuming the guise of a specific individual.</p>

      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Camouflage:</strong> The target may shift its coloration to
      mimic its environment, granting a +5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks.
      This does not stack with invisibility.</p>

      <p><strong>Vocal Mimicry:</strong> The target may perfectly imitate voices
      and sounds with which it is familiar. The target gets a +10 bonus on
      Disguise checks to vocally imitate a creature type, individual, or object
      that they have listened to for at least 10 minutes. These 10 minutes do
      not have to have been during the duration of the shapeshift. This bonus
      does not stack with the bonus to Disguise checks from shapeshift, but does
      increase the bonus to Disguise to imitate a specific individual to +15.
