      <p>You conjure and don a crown representing a chosen court, usually seelie
      or unseelie (though others may be available depending on setting), gaining
      an aura of authority over the fey.</p>

      <p>The fey-blessing gains the descriptor matching the chosen court. The
      crown is weightless and has hardness 5 and 5 hit points per caster level.
      If the crown is destroyed, this fey-blessing ends immediately. If the
      crown is not in your possession at the end of your turn, you lose the
      benefits of this fey-blessing until it returns to your possession. You can
      summon it to yourself as a move action as long as you have line of sight
      to it. You may only have one crown active at a time; activating this
      ability again automatically ends any previous instances.</p>

      <p>Creatures of the fey type that are associated with the chosen court
      (good and neutral for seelie, evil for unseelie) are incapable of taking
      hostile action against you without succeeding on a Will save; if
      successful, they may act as normal and do not need to save again against
      your use of this effect for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>On a failure they are incapable of knowingly taking hostile action
      against you (targeting with an attack or combat maneuver, casting a
      non-harmless sphere effect, spell, or spell-like or supernatural ability
      that includes you as a target or within its area of effect, or aiding or
      granting flanking bonuses to creatures taking hostile action against you)
      for 1 minute. If you take hostile action against a creature that has
      failed its save, it is treated as having succeeded on its save. This is a
      mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>

      <p>Creatures of the fey type not associated with the chosen court are
      shaken whenever they are within 30 feet of you. This is a mind-affecting
      fear effect.</p>
