      <p><strong>Bury:</strong> Concentration, requires sand. You shift the
      sands, swallowing targets within a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster
      levels area centered within range. This functions as Entangle from the
      (plant) package, but on a failure targets cannot move but do not become
      entangled. Each subsequent round they do not escape and this effect is
      still active, the Strength and Escape Artist DC increases by 1. After 10
      rounds or if the target is knocked prone within this area and fails their
      save, they are considered buried and begin to suffocate until they
      escape.</p>

      <p><strong>Dust Storm:</strong> Concentration, requires sand or loose
      dirt. You kick up sand or dirt within a 10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5
      caster levels area centered within range. All creatures fully within this
      area gain concealment (attacks against them have a 20% miss chance). If
      creatures within this area attack creatures outside this area, the targets
      also have concealment.</p>

      <p><strong>Tremor:</strong> Instantaneous, requires dirt or stone. You may
      spend a spell point to send a tremor through the ground, affecting a
      10-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 caster levels area centered within range.
      Targets standing within this area must succeed at a Reflex save or fall
      prone.</p>
