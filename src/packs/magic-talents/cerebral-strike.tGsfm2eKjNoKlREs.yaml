      <p>You unleash a storm of psychic energy that invades the mind of your
      subject.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> The force of your mind directly attacks
      the psyche of your enemy. The target takes 1d8 points of nonlethal damage
      per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d8, Will negates).</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> The mental damage you deal is lasting
      and no longer superficial. In addition to dealing 1d8 points of nonlethal
      damage per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d8), you also deal 1d4 points of
      ability damage to the target&#8217;s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma
      (your choice) + an additional 1 point of ability damage per 6 caster
      levels. Against a successful Will save, you instead deal half of the
      nonlethal damage you would have dealt and no ability damage. (For example,
      a 10th level caster would deal 5d8 points of nonlethal damage + 1d4+1
      points of ability score damage to either Intelligence, Wisdom, or
      Charisma, but against a successful save would only deal half of 5d8
      nonlethal damage.) Ability damage dealt this way cannot decrease an
      ability score below 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> The force of your mental assault
      causes a physiological backlash in the target, along with self-inflicted
      wounds. You deal 1d8 points of nonlethal damage per 2 caster levels (no
      save) and 1d8 + 1 per 6 caster levels of ability damage to your choice of
      the target&#8217;s Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (Will halves).</p>
