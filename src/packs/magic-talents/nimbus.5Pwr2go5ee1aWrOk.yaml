      <p>Some Light talents are designated (nimbus), which notes a talent that
      alters the area of light shed by your glow effects, changing the area in
      which light is increased as well as where the effects of (light) talents
      are applied. You may only apply a single (nimbus) talent to a glow at a
      time but may switch between them and the normal area of your glow as a
      free action, though any (light) talents affect only one area in a
      round.</p>
