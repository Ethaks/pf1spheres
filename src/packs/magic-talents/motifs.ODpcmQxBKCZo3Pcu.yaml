      <p>Some talents are marked (motif). These grant you motifs you can grant
      to targets.</p>

      <p>Less precise than divination, but more proactive, (motif) talents give
      an auspician a glimpse at the pattern of Fate&#8217;s tapestry and allow
      her to nudge one or two threads in a direction she chooses. Unless
      otherwise noted, a talent with the (motif) tag is cast as a standard
      action on a target with a range of touch and costs one spell point. A
      successful Will save negates a motif, and motifs are subject to spell
      resistance. While they normally have a duration of 1 hour per level, the
      target can also discharge a (motif) talent as an immediate action to gain
      an instantaneous or short-lived benefit, after which the effect ends. The
      normal effect ends immediately upon being discharged, and is replaced by
      the instantaneous or short-lived benefit.</p>

      <p>A given creature can never have more than one instance of a particular
      (motif) talent active on them at a time; a second casting at an equal or
      higher caster level replaces the first, while a second casting at a lower
      level has no effect.</p>
