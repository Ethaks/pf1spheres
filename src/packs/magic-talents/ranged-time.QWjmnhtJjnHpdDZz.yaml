      <p>Your alter time effects gain a range of close. You may select this
      talent multiple times. Each time it is selected, you may increase the
      range by one level (close to medium, medium to long). Increasing the range
      beyond close also increases the range at which you may maintain an effect
      through concentration.</p>
