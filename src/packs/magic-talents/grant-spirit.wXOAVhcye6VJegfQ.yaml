    value: >
      <p>When activating one of your spirit Nature abilities, you may touch a
      willing target and grant them the benefit of your (spirit) talent, rather
      than gaining it yourself. This can only be done with (spirit) talents that
      have a non-concentration duration, and requires a minimum of a standard
      action when granting an effect to another.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice. When taken twice, you may spend an
      additional spell point to affect up to 1 additional creature per 2 caster
      levels (minimum 1). Each target must be within range and must be affected
      by the same (spirit) talent and ability. Once created, each spirit is
      considered a separate sphere effect. Taking this talent twice is
      considered a mass talent.</p>
