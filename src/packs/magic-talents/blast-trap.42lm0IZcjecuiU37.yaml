    value: >
      <p>You may place a destructive blast onto an adjacent, unoccupied 5-foot
      square. Any creature who steps onto that square is affected by your
      destructive blast, and is allowed a Reflex save for half damage. A blast
      trap lasts for 10 minutes per caster level before becoming inert. This is
      a magical trap with a Perception DC and Disable Device DC equal to the
      blast&#8217;s save DC. You may have one active blast trap at a time, +1
      per 10 caster levels; placing a trap beyond this limit deactivates an
      earlier trap of your choice.</p>
