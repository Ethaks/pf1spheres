      <p>As an expunge, you set ablaze the magical powers a creature holds,
      damaging them and potentially causing them to lose their magic. You must
      make a ranged touch attack on a creature within range of your expunge. If
      you strike, the creature suffers 1d8 untyped damage, plus an additional
      1d8 damage at 4th caster level and every 3 levels thereafter. For every 5
      damage the creature suffers, they lose a spell point and suffer a -1
      penalty to their magic skill defense for 1 round plus an additional round
      at 10th caster level and every ten levels thereafter. This talent only
      functions on creatures that have a spell pool, whether or not they have
      any spell points remaining.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Transfer talent, you can
      utilize this talent on creatures that cannot normally store spell points.
      If you do, instead of losing spell points or suffering a penalty to their
      magic skill defense, they instead suffer a penalty to the next saving
      throw they make against a magical effect equal to the penalty they would
      have suffered to their magic skill defense, for the same duration.</p>
