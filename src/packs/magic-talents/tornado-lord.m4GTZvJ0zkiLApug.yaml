      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Weather sphere (Wind Lord (advanced)),
      caster level 10th.</p>

      <p>When you use control weather to affect wind, you may alter the path of
      a single tornado within range more precisely. Each round as a free action
      you may plot a course for the tornado, which may be up to 250 feet long
      and may have one turn of up to 90 degrees, plus one turn per 5 caster
      levels above 10th. Alternatively, you may cause the tornado to remain in
      one place. You can alter the path of a tornado caused by magically-altered
      wind combined with Climate.</p>
