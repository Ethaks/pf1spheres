      <p>As an illusion, you may create glamers that suppress and eliminate
      sensation rather than creating their own. Suppressions cannot be negated
      or disbelieved through a Will save. You may suppress any sense that you
      can affect when creating illusions, but each such Suppression is
      considered a separate glamer.</p>

      <p><em>Note:</em> If you suppress every sense required to fool a complex
      or exotic sense, that sense cannot automatically detect that creature.</p>

      <p><strong>Invisibility:</strong> When suppressing vision, you allow the
      target to attempt Stealth checks to hide even while being observed. This
      does not grant the invisible condition, but counts as invisibility for
      effects that interact with it (such as spells that negate it), and
      therefore does not stack with the invisibility spell or other, similar
      effects. The target also gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks
      per caster level (maximum 20). Objects cannot attempt Stealth checks, but
      become difficult to see, requiring a Perception check to find with a DC
      equal to 10 + their size bonus + your caster level. If you are undetected
      by a creature, you gain total concealment against it, as well as a +2
      bonus to attack rolls against it, and you may ignore its Dexterity bonus
      to AC.</p>

      <p><strong>Silence:</strong> When suppressing sound, you cause the
      creature to become muffled. The target loses its armor check penalty to
      Stealth and reduces the penalty associated with sniping by 1 per caster
      level (minimum 0). However, the target also suffers a 5% chance of arcane
      spell failure per caster level (maximum 100%) when using magic that
      requires verbal components or is language-based.</p>

      <p><strong>Touchless:</strong> When suppressing touch, it becomes
      difficult to detect the target by feel. If the target touches or makes a
      melee attack against a creature from Stealth, that creature must succeed
      at a Perception check to even feel that they have been touched or attacked
      (DC 10 + 1 per caster level, -1 per point of damage dealt). The target
      also gains a +1 circumstance bonus per caster level (maximum +20) to
      Sleight of Hand checks made to pick pockets.</p>

      <p><strong>Odorless:</strong> When suppressing taste and smell, the
      affected target inflicts other creatures attempting to track it or
      discover it through smell (such as with the scent special ability) a
      penalty to their Perception or Survival checks equal to -1 per caster
      level (maximum 20). This also applies to checks made to detect poison or
      identify the target via smell or taste. Additionally, if the target
      attempts to use smell to affect other targets (such as making them
      sickened or nauseated through the stench ability), targets gain a +1 bonus
      per caster level (maximum 20) to their saving throws.</p>

      <p>Suppressing magical auras is described in the Manipulate Aura talent,
      and is assumed to be used on all magical auras (including the aura from
      the Suppression itself) affecting the glamered creature.</p>

      <p>You may spend an additional spell point to create a figment that
      suppresses sensations just like the glamer. All targets inside the figment
      gain the above benefits and penalties, as if they were under the effects
      of the glamer. You may choose if this applies only to creatures or to all
      creatures and objects. Unlike other figments, a Suppression figment cannot
      move once placed, and has no sensory expression other than the noticeable
      blurring of sensation inside its area.</p>
