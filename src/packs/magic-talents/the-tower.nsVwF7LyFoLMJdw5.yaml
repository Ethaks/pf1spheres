    value: >
      <p>You may grant a motif that lets the target focus the vagaries of time
      on a creature or object. The target&#8217;s unarmed strikes, natural
      attacks, and manufactured weapons ignore a number of points of damage
      reduction and hardness up to 5 + 1 per 4 caster levels.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect when struck by a manufactured
      weapon and after taking damage (if any). The weapon takes 1d4 untyped
      damage per caster level, ignoring hardness. A successful Reflex save
      halves the damage, but nonmagical items take the full damage regardless of
      the result. If the weapon&#8217;s wielder has evasion, that ability does
      not apply to this saving throw.</p>
