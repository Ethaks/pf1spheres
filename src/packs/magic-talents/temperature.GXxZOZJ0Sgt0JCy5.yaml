      <p>Your control over fire extends to a level of mastery over temperature.
      You gain the following geomancing abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Trail Blaze:</strong> Instantaneous. You may spend a spell
      point to create a wave of ash, hot air and smoke in 120-foot line which
      reveals a safe path to traverse, allowing creatures to ignore difficult
      terrain within the affected area for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
      caster level (minimum 1). Creatures who are caught in the area of effect
      when first cast must attempt a Fortitude save or become exhausted,
      creatures that succeed at their saves become fatigued instead.</p>

      <p><strong>Boil Water:</strong> Concentration, you must possess the
      (water) package. you may, as a standard action, cause a 5-foot cube of
      water per 2 caster levels (minimum one 5-foot cube) within range to heat
      up and boil, dealing 1d6 per 2 caster levels (minimum 1d6, no save) fire
      damage to any creature within. Each round at the beginning of your turn,
      any creature still within the boiling water suffers damage again. If a
      creature enters the boiling water, they immediately suffer damage, but
      only once during their movement, no matter how many times that movement
      takes them in and out of the boiling water.</p>

      <p><strong>Melt Earth:</strong> Concentration, you must possess the
      (earth) package. You may spend 2 spell points as a standard action to melt
      the surface of a 5-foot square of sand, dirt, or stone, plus another
      contiguous 5-foot square per 5 caster levels, transmuting the top inch per
      caster level into lava. This is not enough lava to create vortexes.
      Creatures who enter this square or begin their turn in this square suffer
      1d6 fire damage per caster level (Reflex half, targets who are in the
      square when the lava is created may instead attempt a Reflex save to move
      out of the space and avoid all damage).</p>

      <p>Even after a creature leaves the lava, creatures who failed a saving
      throw against this lava suffer half damage each round for 1d3 rounds (no
      save). A creature may spend a full-round action to remove the lava and end
      this effect for future rounds. If a creature is within this square when
      the effect ends, the earth instantly cools around the creature,
      immobilizing it (Reflex negates).</p>

      <p>An immobilized creature cannot move until it succeeds at Strength or
      Escape Artist check against the caster&#8217;s Nature DC, both of which
      require a full-round action. Alternatively, another creature may attempt a
      Strength check as a standard action to break the earth, or any creature
      may deal 5 damage per caster level to the earth to break it.</p>
