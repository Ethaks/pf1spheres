      <p>As a manabond, you can create a warm bond between yourself and a
      willing creature. When you (but not the recipient of this manabond) are
      targeted by a harmless magical effect that lasts for at least 2 rounds
      that does not require concentration, you may choose to clone the magical
      effect and allow the recipient of this manabond to benefit from that
      magical effect for 2 rounds, but may not last more than a number of rounds
      equal to half the duration that the effect is placed upon you. At 10th
      level and every ten levels thereafter, the magical effect lasts for an
      additional round on your ally.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you are healed for any amount of hit points
      originating from a magical effect (and not from sources such as fast
      healing, regeneration or similar), you can redirect any amount of that
      healing to the recipient of this manabond as a free action that can be
      taken outside of your turn. As the healing is redirected and not merely
      transferred, the healing is still limited by any effects that limited the
      original healing (such as not being able to heal creatures above half
      health, or even being used to damage creatures that are damaged by the
      healing you would receive.)</p>
