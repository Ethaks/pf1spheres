      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fate sphere, caster level 10th.</p>\n<p>You may spend 2 spell points and 10 minutes to place a geas on a touched target with fewer Hit Dice than your caster level. A geas is a magical command that compels the target to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as declared when the geas is placed. The target is allowed a Will save to negate this effect. While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.</p>\n<p>The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the geas remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p>\n<p>If the subject is prevented from obeying the geas for 24 hours, it takes a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another -2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas.</p>\n<p>A geas cannot be dispelled, but it may be broken through the Break Enchantment Life talent, as well spells such as break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish. You may remove a geas that you placed on a target as a standard action.</p>\n",
