    value: >
      <p>As a standard action you may touch a small container of liquid and
      instill a cure, a restore, or an invigorate used in conjunction with the
      Greater Invigorate talent, or a use of the Affliction talent, which
      functions as a potion or oil. This cannot be augmented by the Empathic
      Healing talent.</p>

      <p>An instilled liquid remains potent until you rest to regain spell
      points. If you have equipment on hand (such as an alchemy lab), the cost
      of bottles and water is considered negligible.</p>

      <p>You may target food but not an already-magical item, such as a potion.
      All spell points must be spent and all variables of the sphere effect must
      be chosen at the time the instilled liquid is created. You cannot instill
      multiple effects in a single liquid, nor create multiple instilled liquids
      with a single action.</p>
