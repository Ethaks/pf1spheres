      <p>You may spend a spell point to trap the target in a box made of
      telekinetic force. On a failed Reflex save, the target becomes trapped for
      1 round per caster level, effectively sealing the target off from all
      other creatures. The trapped target cannot move from their space except by
      means of dimensional travel, such as teleport from the Warp sphere, but is
      still trapped even if moved by such an effect. The target treats all other
      creatures as though they had total cover against it, and all other
      creatures treat the target as though it has total cover against them.</p>

      <p>A trapped target may attempt a Reflex saving throw or Escape Artist
      check as a full-round action with a DC equal to this effect&#8217;s DC to
      escape and end this effect. If the target takes damage while trapped, they
      may attempt a check to escape as a free action which can be taken even if
      it is not their turn.</p>
