      <p>As a swift or move action, you may grant yourself one of the following
      benefits for 1 round, depending on what packages you possess. You may
      spend a spell point to gain one of these benefits for 1 minute per caster
      level, or to gain it for one round as an immediate action.</p>

      <p>Whenever you activate this ability, you may spend an additional spell
      point to absorb damage instead of resisting it. Whenever damage is negated
      by one of these benefits, you are healed an amount equal to the negated
      damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Air:</strong> Sonic resistance equal to 10 + your caster
      level.</p>

      <p><strong>Earth:</strong> DR 1/adamantine, +1 per 5 caster levels. This
      stacks with other forms of damage resistance.</p>

      <p><strong>Fire:</strong> Fire resistance equal to 10 + your caster
      level.</p>

      <p><strong>Metal:</strong> Electricity resistance equal to 10 + your
      caster level.</p>

      <p><strong>Plant:</strong> Acid resistance equal to 10 + your caster
      level.</p>

      <p><strong>Water:</strong> Cold resistance equal to 10 + your caster
      level.</p>
