      <p>You may directly control another creature&#8217;s body.</p>

      <p><strong>Lesser Charm:</strong> You may force the target to perform one
      move, swift, or free action of your choice on its next turn (Will
      negates). This could include yelling loudly, falling to the ground,
      dropping its weapon, or moving in a generalized direction (away, toward,
      left, right, etc.). For the purpose of this talent, standing still is a
      free action. The target cannot use its other actions on that turn to undo
      the effect of this lesser charm (pick up a dropped weapon, move back to
      its old square, stand up if it fell down, etc.).</p>

      <p><strong>Greater Charm:</strong> You take control of the target for as
      long as you concentrate, to a maximum of 1 round per caster level. (Will
      negates). The target is allowed a new saving throw as a free action each
      round at the end of its turn to throw off this control. Other than verbal
      actions, the target cannot perform an action of its own choice on its
      turn. While under your control, the target mentally fights you, and so can
      only be made to perform a single move action or standard action each
      round.</p>

      <p>The creature can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a
      charge action. While you may command a target to use an item or perform
      magic, this does not grant you knowledge of the target&#8217;s magical
      abilities or inventory. While you can command a creature to stand still
      and take no action, you cannot command a creature to become helpless or
      give up its Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful Charm:</strong> This is the same as the greater charm,
      except the target is not limited to a single standard action or move
      action each round.</p>
