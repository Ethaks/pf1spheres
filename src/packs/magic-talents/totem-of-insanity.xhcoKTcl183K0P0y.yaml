      <p>You must spend a spell point to create a totem of insanity. Enemies
      within this totem are filled with bloodlust and confusion, and must
      succeed at a Will save upon entering the area of the totem or upon it
      being created. If they fail, then on the beginning of their next turn
      there is a 50% chance they will attack their own nearest ally instead of
      their enemy. If they do, they are considered an ally for the purposes of
      your totems for the duration of the attack. At the end of any turn they do
      this, they receive another saving throw.</p>

      <p>Leaving the totem causes the effect to end for a creature, but
      re-entering it causes the effect to resume if they have not yet made a
      successful saving throw. These are mind-affecting, compulsion effects.</p>
