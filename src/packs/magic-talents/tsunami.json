      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Nature sphere ((water) package, Manipulate Nature (geomancing)), caster level 15th.</p>\n<p>As a concentration effect, you spend 2 spell points to create a wave of water 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide per caster level, and 2 feet tall per caster level. This wave moves in a straight line at 60 feet per round over water (30 feet per round over land), and if not combined with Create Water, must originate from a large body of water. It travels perpendicular to its width, and may be maintained for no more than 5 rounds.</p>\n<p>Creatures struck by the tsunami take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (a Fortitude save halves this damage) and are subject to a special CMB check. The wave&#8217;s CMB is equal to your caster level + your casting ability modifier + 8 (for the wave&#8217;s size). If this CMB check defeats a creature&#8217;s CMD, the creature is knocked prone and carried along by the wave. A creature carried along by a tsunami can attempt to escape the wave on its turn as a standard action by making a CMB or Swim check opposed by the wave&#8217;s CMB check. If a creature fails to escape, it takes another 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude save for half) and continues being carried along by the wave.</p>\n<p>Objects struck by a tsunami are swept up if they are Huge or smaller and are carried along by the wave, deposited in a pile at the end of the wave&#8217;s journey. Gargantuan or larger objects, as well as structures or objects firmly attached to the ground, take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage when a tsunami passes through its space&#8212;if this is enough to destroy the object or structure, the remains are carried along by the wave. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Freedom of movement or the Freedom word prevents a creature from being carried along by a tsunami but does not prevent damage caused by it hitting a creature.</p>\n<p>A solid barrier that is taller than the tsunami that is not destroyed by the wave stops that portion of the wave from continuing onward, leaving a gap in the wave as the rest of it continues forward.</p>\n",
