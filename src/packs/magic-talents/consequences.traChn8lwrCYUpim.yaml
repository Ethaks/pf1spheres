      <p>While this consecration is in effect, any creature in the area that
      attacks any other creature (whether in the area or not) takes untyped
      damage equal to your caster level. For purposes of this effect, an attack
      includes any non-harmless spell, spell-like ability, sphere effect, or
      supernatural ability targeting a hostile creature or whose area of effect
      includes a hostile creature. This consecration can affect a target once
      per round, +1 time per 5 caster levels.</p>

      <p>You must concentrate to maintain this consecration. You may always
      spend an additional spell point as a free action to allow this
      consecration to continue for 1 minute per caster level without
      concentration.</p>
