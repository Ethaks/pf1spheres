    value: >
      <p>You gain the ability to, as a standard action, gaze at a target within
      30 feet which must succeed at a Fortitude save or be stunned for one
      round. Once a creature fails a save vs. this ability, it is immune to your
      use of it for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>(This talent has been modified from the original version found in
      Player&#8217;s Guide to Skybourne.)</p>
