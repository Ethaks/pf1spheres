      "value": "<p>You gain the following abilities which allow you to direct, manipulate, and command undead creatures you control within your dominion range:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Command Attack:</strong> As a standard action, one undead within your dominion range makes an attack against a creature within its threatened reach (or range, if the undead can use a ranged weapon). If you possess the Mass Death Magic talent, you may spend an additional spell point to grant an attack to 1 additional undead per 2 caster levels (minimum 1). If a creature would be attacked by more than one undead with this effect, choose one undead to be the primary attacker. Each additional undead attacking that same target instead uses the aid another action to assist the primary attacking undead&#8217;s attack roll, even if those undead could not normally use the aid another action to assist against that target. If you possess the Reanimated Warriors talent, you may use this ability to allow your undead to assist your own efforts. As an immediate action after you make a weapon attack roll, you may choose one undead within your dominion range. That undead either uses the aid another action to assist your attack roll or is granted an attack of opportunity against the target of your attack, provided that your attack hits the target. An undead granted the ability to use the aid another action or granted an attack of opportunity this way must be able to take the action normally, such as being in a position to aid another you normally or by having the target of your attack within their threatened area.</li>\n<li><strong>Siphon Life:</strong> Whenever you or an undead within your dominion range reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, you may use this talent as an immediate action to grant yourself or an undead within range a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your caster level which last for 1 minute. You may use this effect as a free action that can be taken even when it is not your turn by spending an additional spell point.</li>\n<li>Creatures within your dominion range of you or an undead with temporary hit points from this effect take a -2 penalty on their saving throw against the Necrotic Feeding (ghost strike) talent.</li>\n<li><strong>Unnerving Pulse:</strong> As a standard action, one undead within range releases an unnerving wave of energy. Creatures within 5 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels are shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mindless undead under your control are always considered willing targets of these abilities. An unwilling undead may attempt a Will save to negate this talent&#8217;s effects and not be manipulated.</p>\n",
