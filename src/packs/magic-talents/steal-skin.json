      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fallen Fey sphere, caster level 5th.</p>\n<p>As a full-round action, you may steal the skin of a creature of Small, Medium, or Large size with a roughly humanoid shape. The target creature must be dead, helpless, or willing. If the target creature is alive, you must make a successful coup de grace attack to steal its skin. Should the creature survive this, it is nauseated as a pain effect, takes Constitution bleed of 1d4, bleed damage equal to three times your caster level, and takes a -10 penalty on saves against disease until its skin is regrown by regeneration or a similar effect. Should this bleed damage be halted by any means, it restarts in 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>You then may don or remove the stolen skin as a move action. When wearing a stolen skin, you take on the likeness of the skin&#8217;s original owner, including the victim&#8217;s voice, build, and size, but gain none of the creature&#8217;s abilities. The stolen skin grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that creature, with none of the usual penalties for different gender, race, age, and size. Stolen skins are preserved for the duration of the fey-blessing and remain as supple as living skin. You may only have a single skin stolen at a time; stealing another forces you to discard any previously stolen skins. Discarded skins rot and decay normally. Discarded skins may not be reused.</p>\n",
