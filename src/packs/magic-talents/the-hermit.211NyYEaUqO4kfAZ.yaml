      <p>You may improve a target&#8217;s ability to work alone. The target can
      use the aid another action to aid themselves as a swift action. The bonus
      they gain from doing so is equal to +3 instead of +2, and increases by +1
      for every 5 caster levels. In any round they do so, they may not benefit
      from another creature aiding them.</p>

      <p>The target may discharge this effect to treat all enemies as flanked as
      long as none of the target&#8217;s allies threaten the enemy. This effect
      lasts one round per caster level.</p>
