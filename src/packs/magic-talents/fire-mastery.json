      "value": "<p>You gain a number of ways of expressing mastery over fire. You gain the following geomancing abilities:</p>\n<p><strong>Alter Light:</strong> Concentration. You may alter the light produced by a fire within your Affect Fire maximum. You may halve or double the radius of its light, as well as change its granted light from an emanation to a cone of double its light radius. You may also increase its granted light by 1 level (usually to bright light) or decrease its granted light by 1 level (to dim light).</p>\n<p><strong>Extinguish:</strong> Instantaneous. You may spend a spell point to extinguish any and all fires within your geomancing range that are within your Affect Fire maximum, as you desire.</p>\n<p><strong>Reflash:</strong> Instantaneous. If a non-magical fire within range would become extinguished (through magical or mundane means), you may, as an immediate action, cause the fire to relight in up to a 15-foot radius burst of flame dealing fire damage equal to the largest sized fire you can create. This can be used to reignite a character who has caught on fire and extinguished the flames. If so, a successful Reflex save halves the damage and negates catching fire.</p>\n",
