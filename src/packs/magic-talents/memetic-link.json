      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Mind sphere (Enthrall (charm), Mass Charm [mass], Powerful Charm, Project Thoughts (charm)), caster level 10th.</p>\n<p>When you place a powerful Enthrall charm on a target, you may spend an extra spell point at the time of casting to create a memetic link between you and the target. This link allows the target, if they have access to the Mind sphere, enchantment spells, or similar mind-affecting effects, to treat both itself and you as the caster of any such mind-affecting effects that they produce. All calculations involving caster level, saving throw DCs, magic skill checks, and other similar concerns related to the actual casting still use the target&#8217;s own casting ability, but you are treated as the caster for the purposes of the results. (For example: If your target uses the Read Mind charm on another target, you would both gain the information gleaned from the secondary target&#8217;s mind.) If your target possesses Memetic Link as well, he or she may cede control of an Enthrall charm he or she casts to you as well, creating a potential chain of enthralled targets, though such a chain may only go as long as your casting ability modifier (not counting yourself).</p>\n",
