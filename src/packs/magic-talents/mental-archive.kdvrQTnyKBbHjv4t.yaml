      <p>You construct a magical mental system to perfectly memorize
      information. By concentrating as long it requires to perceive something
      (such as the duration of a speech or while reading a book), you can
      archive it. Once a memory is archived you can concentrate to remember it.
      This can allow you to notice new details by attempting Perception checks.
      This does not allow you to use senses or similar abilities that you did
      not use or possess at the time of memorization (such as a Divination
      sphere effect, or blindsight).</p>

      <p>You can archive a number of memories equal to your casting ability
      modifier + 1 per 2 caster levels. A single memory can be up to one book
      (roughly 400 pages or 100,000 words), one hour of sound, or one minute of
      full sensory experience. Larger works can be archived by using multiple
      memories. You may memorize the content of magical texts and similar
      information, but cannot use their magical properties from memory (such as
      casting from scrolls, scribing spells, or preparing spells from a
      spellbook). You may unarchive memories as a free action, losing your
      ability to perfectly recall them. You may permanently archive a memory by
      spending a spell point; over the next 24 hours, you engrave it perfectly
      into your memory. You cannot replenish the spent spell point until the 24
      hours are complete. At the end of this time, the memory no longer counts
      against your archived memories.</p>

      <p><strong>Tracking Memories:</strong> Mental Archive allows characters to
      store and replace memories, which can require keeping track of. It is
      recommended that players keep a clear list of what they have temporarily
      and permanently memorized.</p>
