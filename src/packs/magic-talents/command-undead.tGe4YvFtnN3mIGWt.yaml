    value: >
      <p>You may spend a spell point to make a ghost strike that grants you a
      measure of control over an undead creature (Will negates). For 1 minute
      per caster level, an unintelligent undead creature falls under your
      control or an intelligent undead becomes friendly toward you. You can give
      an intelligent undead creature orders, but you must win an opposed
      Charisma check to convince it to do anything it would not ordinarily do.
      Retries are not allowed. An intelligent commanded undead never obeys
      suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that
      something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent
      allies that threatens the commanded undead (regardless of its
      Intelligence) breaks this effect.</p>

      <p>Your commands are not telepathic; the undead creature must be able to
      hear you. Intelligent undead remember they were manipulated and may seek
      revenge.</p>
