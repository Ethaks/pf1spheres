      <p>You create a totem that interferes with charm and compulsion magic as
      well as other powers that let a caster enforce their will on others.
      Whenever a creature attempts to exert or maintain mental control over
      another creature inside your totem, they must attempt a magic skill check
      against your magic skill defense or else their attempt fails, and their
      control is suspended for as long as the target remains within the totem.
      During the intervening time, the controlled creature is free. A mindless
      creature may do nothing, or continue in their previous activity, while a
      creature with their own mind may act normally. They are still under the
      effects of any ability that controlled them, they simply are not receiving
      new orders. The controlling caster may attempt to resume control on their
      next turn.</p>

      <p>This totem&#8217;s effects apply to summoned (but not called)
      creatures, mindless creatures, or creatures that are controlled against
      their will. It does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or
      projected spirit), but it does prevent them from controlling the target.
      This totem ignores spell resistance, spell immunity or any other effect
      that would render a creature invulnerable, as it is the interaction that
      is affected by the totem, not the creature itself.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This totem applies against
      mind-affecting charm or compulsion effects which exert active control or
      manipulate the attitude of a subject against their will, such as a
      dominate spell, charm person spell or Mind sphere Enthrall sphere effect,
      possession effect, or other similar abilities. This totem does not
      interfere with other charm and compulsion effects, such as confusion,
      sleep, and similar.</p>
