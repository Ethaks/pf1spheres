      <p>Your companion reduces one of its speeds by 20 feet and gains a 20 feet
      swim speed. Companions with a base form that grants a speed of less than
      20 feet are not eligible for this archetype. If this companion later gains
      the Water Being (form) talent, increase the swim speed granted by that
      talent by +10 feet.</p>
