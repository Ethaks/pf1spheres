      <p>You may add the following traits to your forms:</p>

      <p><strong>Piercing Tail:</strong> The target&#8217;s tail slap becomes
      more powerful, becoming a primary natural attack that deals piercing
      damage (2d6 Medium, 1d8 Small). (Requires tail slap)</p>

      <p><strong>Razor Claws:</strong> Choose one type of natural attack that
      does piercing or slashing damage (bite, claw, etc.). This type of natural
      attack deals 1 point of bleed damage + 1 per 5 caster levels. This bleed
      damage stacks with itself but not other sources of bleed damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Spines:</strong> The target grows spines, quills, or thorns.
      These may be treated as armor spikes of their size (1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small,
      20x2, piercing) but may be enhanced as natural weapons and may be wielded
      as a secondary natural weapon if beneficial.</p>

      <p><strong>Spines, Launch:</strong> The target may launch spines as a
      thrown weapon (1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small, 20x2, piercing) with a range
      increment of 20 feet. The target may draw the spines as a free action and
      throw them for any attacks it is entitled to normally. Launched spines
      regenerate at the end of the target&#8217;s turn. (Requires spines)</p>
