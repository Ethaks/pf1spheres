      <p>You may spend a spell point to understand all spoken and written words,
      regardless of language. You may spend an additional spell point to also be
      understood by any creature with a language. You do not learn the
      creature&#8217;s language, but instead every creature hears you speak in
      whatever language is most comfortable for it.</p>

      <p>While this sense is active, you may understand languages even if you
      lack the senses to normally interpret them. For example, a blind character
      can use this sense to &#8220;read&#8221; written language by touching it
      or a deaf character can use it to read the lips of any creature they can
      perceive.</p>
