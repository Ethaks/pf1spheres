    value: >
      <p>When you are using control weather to create a Precipitation severity
      level 4 or above in an area of Cold severity level 4 or above, you can
      choose to change the snow to hail. Hail has the same effect on movement as
      snow, but it also deals 1 point of bludgeoning damage per severity level
      of Precipitation to everything within the affected area.</p>

      <p>At severity level 4, the visibility penalty of rain does not apply to
      hail, and the -4 penalty to Perception only applies to Perception checks
      based on sound.</p>
