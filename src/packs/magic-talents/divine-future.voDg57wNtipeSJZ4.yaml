      <p>You may divine for a glimpse of the future, giving yourself insight
      into the happenings of that day. At any time during that day, you may add
      an insight bonus equal to 1d4 + 1 per 5 caster levels to one attack roll,
      skill check, saving throw, ability check, initiative roll, or combat
      maneuver roll you are about to make.</p>

      <p>As an immediate action, you may instead grant this benefit to an ally
      who can both see and hear you. You may take this talent multiple times, to
      a maximum of 5 times. You can only have one use of this ability waiting to
      be used at a time per time you have taken this talent. Every time you
      divine for the future, you regain all your uses of this ability for that
      day.</p>
