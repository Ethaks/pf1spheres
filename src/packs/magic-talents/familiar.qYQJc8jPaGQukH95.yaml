      <p>Your companion only gains half its normal Hit Dice (rounded down),
      effectively treating your caster level as half what it is when determining
      its abilities, but has the spell point cost to summon it reduced by 2
      (minimum 0). If the companion would normally only have 1 Hit Die, it still
      has 1 Hit Die, but receives half its normal hit points (rounded down,
      minimum 1).</p>
