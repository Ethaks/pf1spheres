      <p>You may make a ghost strike that attaches a vengeful poltergeist to the
      target, disrupting their actions. Whenever the target makes a d20 roll
      within 1 round per caster level, you can choose for them take a -3 penalty
      to the roll, ending this effect. This penalty is increased by 1 for every
      6 caster levels you have.</p>

      <p>If you spend a spell point when you use this ghost strike, you can
      impose the penalty on up to one d20 roll the target makes each round for
      the effect&#8217;s duration, and imposing the penalty does not end the
      effect. A creature can only be affected by one poltergeist at a time.</p>
