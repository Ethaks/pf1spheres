If you already have ranks in the Craft (traps) skill you may immediately retrain them, but you do not get to retrain when only temporarily gaining talents, such as through the armiger’s customized weapons class feature.\n<p>Possessing this sphere grants you access to the ability to rapidly deploy temporary traps. You may make a Craft (traps) check with a DC of 5 to place a trap on any solid surface within your reach as a full-round action. This trap persists for 1 round per point that your check exceed the placement DC. The trap is placed in a 5-ft. square of your choice. For every 5 ranks in Craft (traps) you possess, you may increase this area by one 5-ft. square. All squares a trap occupies must be contiguous and you can not place two separate traps in the same squares. Entering a trap's space triggers the trap. The Perception DC to locate a trap is 10 + your Craft (traps) modifier. Trap talents that require a saving throw use your ranks in Craft (trap) instead of your base attack bonus when determining your saving throw DCs.</p>\n<p>Traps are cobbled together from scrap, detritus in the environment, and random bits of string, springs, and other miscellany that have been assembled into easily deployed components. Any creature in possession of a trap bag is considered to have the required materials to build these temporary traps, preparing components during downtime and restocking it for negligible cost at regular intervals, though some talents may allow the use of more expensive components that must be tracked. At the GM’s discretion, some traps may be constructed from materials in the environment even without a trap bag.</p>\n<p>You never set off your own traps unless you choose to. Creatures who you warn or who see you set a trap are aware of its location and gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to notice the trap and Reflex saves and AC to avoid the trap. A trap may be removed as a full-round action with a Disable Device check with a DC equal to your Craft (traps) bonus +10. You always succeed on removing your own traps. You may choose to recover any expensive components or Alchemy sphere formulae used in a successfully removed trap.</p>\n<p>If a trap is perceived, it can be targeted and destroyed by attacks without setting it off. A trap has hardness equal to your ranks in Craft (traps), AC equal to 10 + your ranks in Craft (traps), and 5 hit points + 5 hit points per 2 ranks in Craft (traps) you possess.</p>\n<p>As long as you have martial focus, reduce the time required to set a trap from a full-round action to a standard action.</p>\n<p>There are two basic types of temporary traps, snares and darts. A trap may only be triggered once unless otherwise noted. Trap sphere talents that allow for the use of expensive components allow for the component (alchemist fire, dose of poison, etc.) to be drawn as part of the action required to place the trap unless noted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc0\"><span><span style=\"color:#993300\">Darts</span></span></h2>\n<p>A dart trap is constructed of spring, twine, and usually a needle or other blade. A dart targets a line originating from one corner of one of the squares it occupies determined when it is set. This line extends out to Close range (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 ranks of Craft (traps) you possess) and stops after one creature is hit. When triggered, make a ranged attack roll against each creature in the line until one is hit. You may substitute your ranks in Craft (traps) + your Intelligence modifier for your base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier on this roll. The dart deals 1d6 piercing damage, increasing by 1d6 when your Craft (traps) ranks reach 3 and every 2 ranks thereafter, and has a critical threat range of 20 with a x3 multiplier. Some talents allow you to modify your darts. Each trap may only benefit from one (dart) talent. Some trap talents allow you to forgo dealing damage for benefits as defined in that talent.</p>\n<p>You may forgo dart damage to expend an alchemical item (such as a tanglefoot bag), a thrown splash weapon (such as alchemist’s fire or acid flasks), or a dust (a potion containing a spell that affects an area) when making a dart trap to add the effects of that splash weapon to the dart. Resolve the attack versus touch AC. Items with an area of effect count their origin from the nearest corner of the struck creature’s space to the line of the dart’s effect.</p>\n<p>You may apply injury poison to a dart as if it were a weapon after it has been set. While setting the trap, you may choose to forgo dart damage, instead expending a dose of a contact or inhaled poison as part of setting the trap. The dart then resolves its attack vs. touch AC. An inhaled poison fills its area as normal, centered on the struck creature’s square (or the first square targeted by the line, if the creature occupies more than one space).</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc1\"><span><span style=\"color:#993300\">Snares</span></span></h2>\n<p>A snare trap is constructed from rope, wire, and similar materials. A snare targets the first creature to enter one of the squares it occupies. A creature may avoid triggering a snare with a successful Reflex save; doing so leaves the trap untriggered and makes the creature aware of the trap and able to pass through that trap’s space(s) without further risk of triggering it. Some talents grant additional types of snares. Each trap may only benefit from one (snare) talent.</p>\n<p>An alchemical item may be rigged to a snare trap. If a creature triggers the trap, the alchemical item is activated, targeting a grid intersection adjacent to the trap chosen when it is set. If the alchemical item is a thrown splash weapon, the triggering creature is affected by the item as if it were struck directly by it. Other small items such as dyes, dusts, vials of perfume, and other items with GM permission may also be attached to a snare trap as well.</p>\n<p>An inhaled poison may be rigged to a snare trap. If a creature triggers the trap, the first square entered (the creature’s choice if there is more than one entered simultaneously) becomes the centerpoint for the inhaled poison.</p>\n<p>When you first gain the Trap sphere, you gain the following snare:</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Tripwire (snare)</span></h4>\n<p>A creature that fails its save against a tripwire snare falls prone. Once knocked prone, a creature is no longer at risk of triggering the trap in that square. This trap is not destroyed when triggered; instead the duration is reduced by 5 rounds per creature that fails its save. Running and charging creatures take a -2 penalty on their Reflex saves against this trap.</p>\n<hr /><br />\n<br /><b>Trap Talents</b><br /><ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.AGD2WOBm3dz7HNv1]{Aerial Trigger}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.q8zK4iORf8Ak5p1C]{Aimed Dart}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.1cFBxt4G3gX35vYn]{Alchemical Trap Master}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.UazIyamiXuyROnMS]{Combined Traps}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.7nb6HT58cNiuIedb]{Crowd Pleaser}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.q6BuXSkcphBGyN38]{Dirty Traps}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.yD1AbPmvOKrvmFyw]{Expert Eye}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.HKcuBVQzl9Id4W8x]{False Trigger}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.TdsDRFXcvrZH90Uq]{Fool’s Retreat}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.UVmjOUtndrTTR5TY]{Opportunist}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.MTmsuM9NMFPLmUEK]{Persistent Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.kg9M0XXpKbqvWv77]{Rapid Placement}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.na6J0nh5WoiUc7pi]{Razor Wire}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.lvyh9uGBVpXbvQjX]{Remote Trigger}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.wMVPdG7YwrOdqAgO]{Scatter Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.R4McYDLWxQoZOO2Q]{Sneaky Trapper}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.cJnwP8QULm8eqswH]{Stop Drop And Control}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.ARUFEvKUpSW2qZw4]{Trap Door}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.HAYRa24xEqTbLGm4]{Trap Finder}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.TPvNUZgqgVJ84XRM]{Trap Launcher}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.frILcnhdlXfZDmTU]{Trap Wielder}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.7pl4wSVVvYAlLfQD]{Trapped Shield}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.U1URZgECDs6Kwrvm]{Trapper’s Recovery}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.N0HnD3dYJoUt8Vou]{Trapsmith}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.mo61ou5EfoCi8Bs5]{Warning}</li>\n</ul><br /><b>Dart Talents</b><br /><ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.Nl5VWhK3US4ZvVt4]{Barbed Dart}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.EI3OfXVBBiaEjKWP]{Blunt Dart}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.vYSo7eGnkfBaPfeh]{Deadly Dart}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.99xquwpcYjX7OOxE]{Flash Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.67PhglZeAwjWtuvq]{Net}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.XXQ7OuBHbtiAdIFw]{Tethered Dart}</li>\n</ul><br /><b>Snare Talents</b><br /><ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.EDvwD0DfFClkSJUp]{Alarm Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.BbpEWibAxS21Fe1N]{Bamboozling Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.izkYar4vHW9BRyC7]{Bear Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.pqa4hrWKpl7U0MSf]{Brutal Traps}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.TiAyVwoqk4v2BVpu]{Disarming Traps}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.99xquwpcYjX7OOxE]{Flash Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.GMoAsGpuNF8LwrVt]{Foam Spray}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.AH82nXsgr63dWaKj]{Magic Trigger}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.67PhglZeAwjWtuvq]{Net}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.749r7hQxutrpRsz0]{Noose}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.0FSiYIUHA5g2HkZJ]{Scratching Post}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.ggi96nGowWEaBVMU]{Skunk Smoke}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.wSWy1Wojd6bVlyVQ]{Techno Trigger}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.QGYnDBATrlb94pII]{Terrain Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.LiATGAk9LIDxKYY0]{Tricky Traps}</li>\n</ul><br /><b>Legendary Talents</b><br /><ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.0SEtIKcYMsOTXSOM]{A Better Mouse Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.Gxf9aX4RVUudkUNt]{All Part Of The Plan}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.zj1lW3YSinTXzQBy]{Ghost-Touch Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.i4BvZm5jIMRzPHh1]{Guillotine}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.sUFxWi4aPQliO6hb]{Penetrating Trap}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.srEn8xccWBsHJN8k]{Plummeting Traps}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.FUpA2LV1t0MYHfiY]{Temporal Snare}</li></ul>"
