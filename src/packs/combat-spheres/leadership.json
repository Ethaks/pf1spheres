  "content": "<h1 id=\"toc0\">Leadership Sphere</h1>\n<p>Practitioners of the Leadership sphere learn how to gather, organize, and command others. When you gain the Leadership sphere, you gain 5 ranks in the Diplomacy skill, plus 5 ranks per additional talent spent in the Leadership sphere (maximum ranks equal to your total Hit Dice). If you already have ranks in the Diplomacy skill you may immediately retrain them. Both base packages of the Leadership sphere require significant time investment and thus are unsuitable for being granted as a temporary talent. Likewise, no (follower) talents may be granted as temporary talents. (Cohort) talents that do not affect the type or number of creatures you can recruit may be gained as temporary talents if you have the (cohort) package.</p>\n<p>If you possess multiple spheres that grant ranks in Diplomacy, you gain a competence bonus on Diplomacy checks equal to half your base attack bonus instead of retraining the ranks multiple times. This is only applied once.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Animal companions, Conjuration sphere companions, drake companions, eidolons, familiars, independent inventions, Leadership cohorts, and any other controlled characters gained by class features, talents or feats cannot gain this sphere or talents from this sphere. When you first take the Leadership sphere, choose one of the following packages: Cohort or Follower. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Leadership.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc1\">Leadership Sphere and Wealth</h4>\n<p>Hiring NPCs to accompany you on adventures normally costs wealth. Likewise, having a group of commoners working for you would normally be expected to generate wealth. The Leadership sphere is intended neither to force players to pay gold to use abilities they paid character-building resources (talents) for, nor to significantly skew expected wealth. The costs and profits from cohorts and followers from the Leadership sphere are abstracted. Cohorts are paid in the experience they gain, in the miscellaneous items that they recover and sell that the PCs don't bother with, and from surplus income of followers (if the (followers) package is also possessed). Likewise, wealth generated by followers is assumed to go into providing the mechanical benefits they provide, into establishing businesses and homes, into bribes, and towards supporting their leader and his associates.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: General Profits:</strong> Some Leadership talents state that you can make earnings checks, and that these stack with capital gains from other talents. This means that you can make a check for each such talent when calculating earnings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc2\">Cohort Package</h2>\n<p>Specialized NPCs called cohorts are willing to follow you on adventures. A cohort always acts on your initiative. You gain the following ability:</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\">Recruit</h4>\n<p>You may recruit adventurers, mercenaries, and sellswords to actively assist you. Recruiting requires spending 8 hours in a settlement and making a Diplomacy check. You may select the profession and martial tradition you are looking for, and may also specify a particular race from those available. Not all races, professions, and traditions will be available in all locations; the available pool is determined by the GM. The base DC of this check is 10 + the Hit Dice of the person you are looking to recruit, modified per Settlement Size Modifier and Miscellaneous Modifier tables. Modifiers are cumulative. You may take 10 on this check.</p>\n<p>You may not recruit a creature with more Hit Dice than the maximum shown on Table: Cohort. The exact feats and talents the cohort possesses are up to the GM, though you may reject a given cohort and attempt to recruit another with the normal action. Recruits are usually humanoids with no racial Hit Dice, and are of races available in the region you are recruiting. Creatures with racial Hit Dice, templates, or abilities unsuitable to player races are not suitable to be cohorts.</p>\n<p>You may have multiple recruited creatures under your control, but their total Hit Dice cannot exceed your ranks in Diplomacy. If you attempt to recruit a creature that would exceed your Hit Dice cap, you must choose which other creatures to release from your service.</p>\n<p>A cohort serves you loyally and will follow you into and aid you during combat, but will not obey obviously suicidal orders nor subject itself to harm for no obvious purpose. Cohorts are usually within 1 alignment step of you, though some exceptions may occur at the GM’s discretion.</p>\n<p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Effects that increase effective BAB or skill ranks in a sphere do not accelerate the strength of leadership cohorts or similar partners, just as increasing your caster level does not accelerate the hit dice of Conjuration sphere companions. Only effects that actually raise your effective level, such as the Spherebound mythic quality or a Conscript sphere specialization, can increase the hit dice of cohorts and similar companions.</sup></p>\n<p><strong>Table: Settlement Size Modifiers</strong></p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Population</th>\n<th>Settlement Size</th>\n<th>DC Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fewer than 21</td>\n<td>Thorp</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21–60</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61–200</td>\n<td>Village</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>201–2,000</td>\n<td>Small town</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2,001–5,000</td>\n<td>Large town</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5,001–10,000</td>\n<td>Small city</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10,001–25,000</td>\n<td>Large city</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>More than 25,000</td>\n<td>Metropolis</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Table: Miscellaneous Modifiers</strong></p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Factor</th>\n<th>Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settlement is predominantly of a different alignment to you.</td>\n<td>+1 per step (cumulative)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Population of settlement is at least 50% of a particular race you are seeking.</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5% to 25% of the population of the settlement is of a particular race you are seeking.</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Less than 5% of the population is of a particular race you are seeking.</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You are looking for your own race.</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You do not specify the profession.</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You do not specify tradition.</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>You are attempting to recruit a contact.</td>\n<td>-5, ignore DC modifications for alignment, race, profession, and tradition.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>A cohort has been killed and not resurrected.</td>\n<td>+5 (cumulative for each death, reduced by 1 for each month since the cohort’s death)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signing bonus of 10 gp per Hit Die.</td>\n<td>-1 (cumulative, may be applied up to 5 times)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Supplying magical equipment.</td>\n<td>Reduces DC equal to half the cumulative enhancement bonus of weapons and armor, (minimum reduction of -1).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Settlement is particularly insular, isolated, or opposed to you.</td>\n<td>Varies, GM decision</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\">Building A Cohort</h3>\n<p>Cohorts gain abilities based on their Hit Dice and race. The listed statistics are modified by the cohort’s race as normal. Cohorts are considered to have a CR equal to their Hit Dice - 2 for purposes that require it. Cohorts have class skills according to their creature type (Climb, Craft, Handle Animal, Heal, Profession, Ride, and Survival for humanoids), plus the ones listed in their profession. Select from the following professions to determine the cohort’s base statistics:</p>\n<p><strong>Student</strong><br /><strong>Hit Dice</strong> d6; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (bad), Ref (good), Will (good); <strong>Ability Scores</strong> Str 11, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 16, Wis 9, Cha 10; <strong>Practitioner Modifier</strong> Int; <strong>Skill Points per Hit Die</strong> 2; <strong>Class Skills</strong> Appraise, Knowledge (all), Use Magic Device; <strong>Magic Scholar:</strong> Students gain the Alchemy sphere as a bonus talent at 1 Hit Die.

Cohorts begin play with leather armor and a dagger in addition to any equipment listed in their descriptions; further equipment must be supplied to them. A cohort’s starting gear may not be used to increase PC wealth; it cannot normally be sold and if extreme circumstances occur where the PCs benefit from its loss, it must be replaced (or wealth sufficient to pay for replacements given) at the earliest possible time. If the cohort is deceased, this payment must be made to their next of kin or other designee (it is assumed that such a person always exists as part of normal recruitment). If a cohort is equipped with additional items, the cohort will not keep them if leaving your service.</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Cohort</strong></p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Ranks in Diplomacy</th>\n<th>Maximum Hit Dice</th>\n<th>Base Attack Bonus</th>\n<th>Feats</th>\n<th>Good Saves</th>\n<th>Bad Saves</th>\n<th>Combat Talents</th>\n<th>Special</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>Martial tradition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Ability score increase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>+2 enhancement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+6/+1</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+6/+1</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+7/+2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+8/+3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Ability score increase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+9/+4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>+4/+2 enhancement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>+9/+4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+6</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>+10/+5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>+7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>+11/+6/+1</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+7</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+12/+7/+2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Ability score increase</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+12/+7/+2</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+13/+8/+3</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+6/+4/+2 enhancement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>+14/+9/+4</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>+9</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+15/+10/+5</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+9</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+15/+10/+5</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+9</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>+16/+11/+6/+1</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>+10</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Ability score increase</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When you gain a level and your ranks in Diplomacy increase, you may assign an additional Hit Die to current cohorts, up to the maximum they may possess and not causing the total Hit Dice you have recruited to exceed your limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A cohort begins with one feat, and gains another feat at every odd Hit Die. A cohort may gain any PC feat for which it qualifies. Cohorts may not gain magic item crafting feats.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Talents:</strong> Cohorts gains talents with the proficient progression.</p>\n<p><strong>Martial Tradition:</strong> Your cohort gains a martial tradition, using the practitioner modifier given by their profession.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Just like PCs and Monsters, a cohort gains a permanent +1 bonus to an ability score of your choice for every 4 Hit Dice possessed.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> At 5 Hit Dice, a cohort gains a +2 enhancement bonus to one ability score. At 9th level, they increase this bonus to +4 and gain a +2 bonus to an additional ability score. At 13th level, the first bonus increases to +6, the second to +4, and they gain a +2 bonus to an additional ability score. These bonuses may be retrained as if they were a single feat.</p>\n<p>Talents marked (cohort) grant additional options for your cohorts. Some abilities call out joint actions. These actions require both the user and his cohort to pay the requisite action cost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc5\">Re-Recruiting Cohorts</h3>\n<p>A cohort that leaves your service on good terms is easier to recruit. You may maintain a network of such former cohorts, called contacts, equal to twice your practitioner ability modifier (minimum 2). Such contacts do not normally travel with you beyond reaching the nearest settlement. Each contact will have a place of residence, usually in a settlement but sometimes a wilderness area, ship, or other abode. You may send messages to a contact by whatever means you have available, requesting that they meet you at a particular time and place, allowing you to recruit them. Talents such a Messenger, and legendary talents such as Air Travel, Planisphere, and Teleportation can facilitate getting messages to the contact and their traveling to meet you. Contacts are able to travel to your caravan at the same rate as your Messengers.</p>\n<p>Contacts have lives apart from following you and may on occasion send requests for aid or show up in unexpected places. Unlike a cohort, there is no penalty for the death of a contact. Mindless cohorts may not become contacts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc6\">Roleplaying Cohorts</h3>\n<p>Cohorts are generally under the player's control regarding their mechanical actions, especially during adventures, but they are not mindless automatons. Cohorts that are abused or mistreated will abandon the player when able to do so. Normally, the GM will speak for cohorts. Another option is to allow other players to control some cohorts, investing them in the cohort's development and well-being. The other players could be allowed a degree of latitude to portray a unique personality for the cohort, emphasizing that it is a unique person rather than simply a class ability. This should obviously only be done after consulting with the other players and may not work in all groups. Be aware that this invites the others players' input on how the cohort is used, which may be unwelcome to some players.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc7\">Follower Package</h2>\n<p>You gain a group of followers. These followers will not accompany you into dangerous locations, but can lend assistance in various ways. Followers can supply unskilled labor for simple tasks, such as clearing a road obstructed by falling rocks. Count the followers as supplying a number of Medium-sized unskilled laborers equal to half the number of followers in the settlement (or caravan). While doing so, the followers cannot provide their other benefits. If attacked, followers will attempt to flee to a safe place to the best of their ability. You normally have about 5 followers per rank in Diplomacy. If statistics are needed for a particular follower, treat them as level 1 commoners.</p>\n<p>If you possess the Alchemists, Craftsmen, Entertainers, Healers, Merchants, Rangers, or Scholars talents, then there is a 10% chance per talent that a randomly selected follower will be a level 1 expert. When you gain this package, choose a settlement with which you are well acquainted. Your initial followers are drawn from there. When first gaining this package, it is assumed that you have spent time in the past making contacts, deals, and promises and that you are well known enough in the community to attract a group of followers.</p>\n<p>Should the number of followers available be reduced for any reason, the effectiveness of (followers) talents is reduced, treating your ranks in Diplomacy as equal to the number of available followers/4. You normally regain 1 follower per rank in Diplomacy each day you spend in a settlement where your followers are dispersed, but you can double this number with 8 hours of active effort each day. If you have lost all of your followers or do not disperse your followers in the settlement, the recruitment rate is halved (minimum 1 follower per day).</p>\n<p>If using the downtime rules found in Ultimate Campaign, having your followers present in a settlement increases the effect of Influence or Labor you spend by 50%, to a maximum of 1 additional Influence or Labor for every 2 followers in the settlement where the downtime activity takes place. Any talents that enable followers to make checks to generate capital receive any benefits from rooms and teams you have access to. If a talent allows followers to generate capital, the entire group of followers makes this check collectively. Any results that are not sufficient to generate capital on a given day may be carried over to the next day; this carrying-over may be continued until the result is sufficient to generate capital or your followers leave the settlement.</p>\n<p>If using the kingdom building rules found in Ultimate Campaign, possessing this package grants a +1 bonus to all kingdom attributes you affect.</p>\n<p>When you first gain the follower package, you gain the following ability:</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc8\">Caravan</h4>\n<p>Your followers can follow you as you travel, providing cartage. This caravan has an overland movement speed of 3 miles per hour and can travel 32 miles a day. The caravan has wagons and draft animals necessary to carry 100 pounds of objects per rank in Diplomacy in addition to sufficient provisions to sustain themselves in normal conditions. A caravan is assumed to be capable of making Survival checks with a DC of 10 + your ranks in Diplomacy to feed itself and 1 additional Medium creature per 5 followers (Medium creatures count as two Small creatures, Large creatures count as two Medium ones) while moving without affecting speed. In harsher environments, the caravan has supplies for 1 week plus 1 day per rank in Diplomacy that you possess. If their Survival check is not more than 5 below the environment DC, they count as only spending half a day’s supplies.</p>\n<p>The caravan can make camp, setting up tents, cooking, and performing other camp tasks. Doing so increases the progress a PC can make when crafting while adventuring by 2 hours per day (normally going from 2 hours to 4 hours a day).</p>\n<p>When you enter a settlement, you can disperse your caravan there, allowing you to gain the benefits of your followers while in that settlement. Gathering a caravan after it has been dispersed requires 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your caravan doesn’t have to rest at the same time as you do. If the caravan rests while you adventure, they can travel while you rest, carrying a number of Medium creatures equal to your practitioner modifier plus your ranks in Diplomacy. Two Small creatures counts as one Medium creature, two Medium creatures count as one Large creature, etc.</p>\n<p>A caravan that is attacked in your absence will disperse. A dispersed caravan will reform, regaining 25% of its members every hour after threats are removed. If statistics are required for the caravan, treat it as a 1 Hit Die troop per the Squad talent, but it takes no action except to attempt to flee to safety. The number of troops increases by +1 for every 5 ranks in Diplomacy you possess, with your total number of followers divided equally between them. If such a troop is destroyed, treat half the followers in it as lost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc9\">Dividing Followers</h3>\n<p>You may divide your followers into multiple groups (minimum size of 5), treating your ranks in Diplomacy as equal to the number of available followers/4 (round down as usual). You may have multiple caravans, but any caravan not accompanied by a PC or cohort is at risk from the various hazards of travel and may not reach its destination, based on the conditions in the region it travels. The GM should roll random encounters, treating combat encounters as dispersing the caravan. Combat encounters with a CR of less than half your ranks in Diplomacy disperse the caravan but cause no permanent losses. Encounters with a CR of at least half your ranks in Diplomacy but not greater than your ranks disperses the caravan and causes 25% losses. A combat encounter with a CR of greater than your ranks in Diplomacy disperses the caravan and causes 50% losses. A caravan reduced below 4 followers is lost entirely.</p>\n<p>Talents marked (follower) grant additional options for your followers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc10\">Roleplaying Followers</h3>\n<p>While naming and developing personalities and tracking the abilities and developments of each individual in a large group of followers would be unnecessarily onerous, players and groups are encouraged to develop at least a few key followers to act as the focal points for interactions with followers. While on the move, a caravan will usually have a boss, directing others to execute the PC's directions. Likewise, talents that grant additional skills to your followers each lend themselves to having one higher ranking follower direct activities (scouting, trade, crafting) of the group of followers. As with cohorts, the GM will normally voice these NPCs, but in some groups allowing other players to speak and develop personalities for some of them could make the interactions more interesting.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc11\">Followers And Statistics</h3>\n<p>Followers are normally intended to be governed by the abilities listed in the followers package and relevant talents. Using the statistics for commoners, experts, and troops are intended for use primarily when interactions cannot be easily handled narratively. Followers are not intended to be expendable operatives, skilled infiltrators, or massed alchemical bombers. If a PC's actions cause the unnecessary death of followers, follower recruitment may be slowed. Losses in the normal course of events should not have an effect; ambushes and unforeseen events occur, but repeated and extended abuse will discourage others from joining you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><br /><br /><strong>Leadership Talents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.ZZbJ0SmkQQHA4PLF]{Expanded Leadership}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.ewOJBdBgUdnZ88jp]{Military Training}</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><strong>Cohort Talents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.iCVbakli1tbv8JjE]{Additional Contacts}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.YZJr3Pk5llv2cBuu]{Allied Cover}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.TnIykHl3VaJXpYZg]{Cohort Attack}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.sxvLDqVG7PBHzPR4]{Defensive Cover}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.lvQZn6navGa8tUZD]{Drill Sergeant}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.ztXetmv6eyMHqc84]{Greater Recruitment}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.sZno9rBil0dNwCoU]{Master’s Instruction}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.PY5oKQLD839tf9on]{Opening Maneuver}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.uTKnlYNsZCfRRHVb]{Opportunistic Teamwork}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.JKWUyLPj5bxC3cMO]{Pack Tactics}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.16m3NwFhvuQnqwMe]{Practiced Teamwork}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.9NJrzw7ygSCfVcaA]{Squad}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.q3bSTk1rO7jRp4wc]{Talented}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.KtpLUYoX2k7gw8nv]{Team Lookout}</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><strong>Follower Talents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.So9ONqHhvnTllURI]{Alchemists}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.MQL1nVT6q0Uvt6lZ]{Artificers}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.wWTvwvQZ2PI0LZn4]{Base Of Operations}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.AkZcsX26cIB8DSyj]{Craftsmen}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.tstSw8CNcCMJw3RG]{Crew}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.jNiYaPrMo8CggC3D]{Entertainers}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.UJuE8S1LNeMfi2X7]{Friends In Low Places}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.nmkxxwO1kUKrHOzJ]{Ground Team}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.yCLhnHL6nbLA4OuA]{Healers}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.rBUh5ermIAhOIVqg]{Laborers}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.1MUQTzifPvGQxgBZ]{Manager}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.7e0bu6OVGPWBNXA0]{Merchants}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.kZaMZ65vgLVj7wBg]{Messengers}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.IHNrJ7jkw8z1UnLX]{Mystic Craftsman}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.I7QhlmnOpTBVh4qi]{Rangers}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.9HREFoRf8EOpW65D]{Scholars}</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><strong>Legendary Talents</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.hNFWM4m2iZFOTIQO]{Advanced Cohorts}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.iL9RHx5O5PjuyAhT]{Air Travel}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.yB11j7ARugJAP9p8]{Alien Connections}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.veB7CwsNpsyxhWXU]{Brainwash}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.LJDgxc9JubklYgjU]{Constructor}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.uoTES1lNWt5Kz2py]{Contractors}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.15dcreXN26SGE2UM]{Draft}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.SM9iu7gfailUzaHY]{Form Army}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.SBrWtL3mIY7zgg7C]{Friends In High Places}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.Pqb4JU9JCd1zhLi8]{Magic Cohort}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.DxthpCWNUTzO0zyM]{Master Of The Dead}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.00zBtZGqqzFsRqZy]{Planisphere}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.FQd4WXD8BqpTKg2F]{Strange Bedfellows}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.5M5kfokuKTpJNkJv]{Teleportation}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.OFAFPcO9Jh8aLBel]{Two Day Shipping}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.combat-talents.P5hZw9JDfAxrTzBO]{Party Followers}</li>\n</ul>",
