  "content": "You may alter and create physical materials.\n<h2 id=\"toc0\"><span>Alter</span></h2>\n<p>Altering an object is a standard action and requires you to touch the object to be altered. Alter is subject to spell resistance. You cannot alter an animate target (such as a golem or animated object) and the object must be non-magical and unattended (not held, worn, or part of a creature’s equipment). While some talents may affect these limitations, artifacts can never be altered.</p>\n<p>When you gain the Creation sphere, you may alter objects in the following ways:</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc1\"><span>Destroy</span></h4>\n<p>You deal damage to the object equal to 1d4 + 1/2 your caster level. This bypasses all hardness. An object reduced to less than half its hit points gains the broken condition.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Repair</span></h4>\n<p>You may repair a damaged object, healing it for a number of hit points equal to 1d4 + 1/2 your caster level. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points.</p>\n<p>This ability cannot restore warped or transmuted items, but it can still repair damage done to such items.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc3\"><span>Create</span></h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to create a non-magical, unattended object out of vegetable matter such as wood, hemp, or cotton in either your hand or an adjacent square. You may create objects with multiple materials, provided you can create all the materials required. Adamantine cannot be altered or created, except for the Repair and Destroy abilities. The object may be of equivalent size to one Small object per caster level (see chart below) and lasts as long as you continue to concentrate, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster level. When creating an object you may spend an additional spell point to allow that object to persist for 1 minute per caster level without concentration. A created object may be dismissed as a standard action.</p>\n<p>If the created object is especially large, it must begin in an adjacent square and must be completely contained within close range. You may choose to create objects that can be moved easily, or can create objects that are anchored to an unattended surface large enough to hold that part of the object (such as a bridge being anchored to both sides of a gap, or a wall growing out of the ground). You cannot create an object directly onto a creature or attended object (summoning manacles onto someone’s wrists, etc.).</p>\n<p>When attempting to break an object that does not have a predetermined Break DC, the Break DC is equal to 10 + the object’s hardness +1 per inch in the item’s thickness. For example, a 2-inch thick stone wall would have a Break DC of 10 + 8 hardness + 2 inches, or DC 20.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, you cannot create alchemical items, poisons, materials that deal damage on contact or items that carry special properties or knowledge you do not possess (rare herbs, the key to a lock you did not construct, etc.). While simple objects such as candles, folds of cloth, simple furniture, or basic weapons are easy to create; particularly complex objects (mechanics, crossbows, objects with moving parts) require a Craft check made against the object’s Craft DC. Likewise, non-magical common herbs can be created through a successful Knowledge (Nature) check, such as wolfsbane or the night tea plant. For herbs and items with no predetermined Craft DC, the check DC is assumed to be equal to 10 +1 per 5 gp in the item’s cost, though any items with a DC above 15 cannot be made. Failure means the object comes into being broken and unusable, or otherwise incorrect.</p>\n<p>A DC 15 Appraise check reveals the object as a magical fake. Fabricated objects have a lingering magical aura that can be detected as magic, although the objects themselves are not magical.</p>\n<strong>Table: Object Materials</strong><br />\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Substance</th>\n<th>Hardness</th>\n<th>Hit Points</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Glass</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paper or cloth</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rope</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ice</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>3/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Leather or hide</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wood</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>10/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stone</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>15/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Iron or steel</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>30/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mithral</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>30/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adamantine</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>40/in. of thickness</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<strong>Table: Object Size</strong><br />\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Object Size</th>\n<th>Minimum Caster level (number of Small objects contained)</th>\n<th>Example Objects</th>\n<th>Maximum Weight (lbs.)</th>\n<th>Falling Damage (to both object and target)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Chair</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Table</td>\n<td>125</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Statue</td>\n<td>625</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Wagon</td>\n<td>3,125</td>\n<td>3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>Catapult</td>\n<td>15,625</td>\n<td>4d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>32</td>\n<td>Ship</td>\n<td>78,125</td>\n<td>5d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal+</td>\n<td>64</td>\n<td>Tavern</td>\n<td>390,625</td>\n<td>6d6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p><sup><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The maximum weight table is intended to help when approximating created objects by weight and not volume (number of Small objects).</sup></p>\n<strong>Table: Weapon Sizes</strong><br />\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Weapon Type</th>\n<th>Size Adjustment (From Size of Intended Wielder)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shuriken, needles, etc.</td>\n<td>Four sizes smaller</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ammunition, daggers</td>\n<td>Three sizes smaller</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light weapons</td>\n<td>Two sizes smaller</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>One-handed weapons</td>\n<td>One size smaller</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Two-handed weapons</td>\n<td>Same size</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span>Clarifications</span></h3>\n<p>There are dozens of ways a created object can interact with the world, and many of the details of those interactions are determined by the GM. The following notes, however, include clarifications about various types of created objects.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc5\"><span>Falling Objects</span></h4>\n<p>Objects that fall upon characters deal falling damage based on their size according to Table: Object Size.</p>\n<p>Objects made of stone or harder substances deal double falling damage, while soft object such as cloth deal half falling damage. An object falling less than 30 feet also deals half falling damage, while an object falling more than 150 feet deals double falling damage. These multipliers stack; a stone object falling 150 feet would deal x4 damage, while a cloth object falling 20 feet would deal 1/4th damage. A falling object takes the same amount of falling damage as it deals, and no falling object can deal more than 20d6 falling damage. Additional damage, such as through enhancements, acid coatings, etc., is not multiplied or divided by hardness or falling distance.</p>\n<p>Dropping an object on a creature is considered an attack with a ranged weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. This distance is measured from the object’s starting point to the target’s square, rather than the distance between you and the target. When making an attack roll with a falling object, use your Intelligence instead of your Dexterity when calculating your attack bonus.</p>\n<p>When dropping an object on a target that is larger than the dropped object, make an attack roll against their AC. This is similar to a weapon attack. When dropping an object that is the same size or larger than the target, make an attack roll against their touch AC. This is similar to using an indirect-fire siege weapon, and carries some additional rules:</p>\n<p>When using a Large or larger object like an indirect-fire siege weapon, the object targets a creature in a square, but also deals half its falling damage as splash damage to additional creatures within 5 feet + 5 feet per size category above Large of the object being dropped.</p>\n<p>When using a dropped object of Medium size or larger like an indirect-fire siege engine, you may target a grid intersection instead of a creature like you can with a splash weapon, in which case direct damage is not dealt and splash damage (if any) affects creatures as normal. Also, like a splash weapon, if you miss with a dropped object, the object veers off course one space per range increment. Roll a d8 to determine the direction in which the object veered off-course, just as with a splash weapon.</p>\n<p>A dropped, hard, non-wall/covering object larger than the creatures underneath it will push creatures out of the area where it fell to the nearest unoccupied spaces, while objects the same size or smaller would themselves move to the nearest unoccupied spaces. Walls and coverings larger than the objects underneath them function as catches, described below.</p>\n<p>A dropped soft non-covering object, such as a large bundle of cloth, that is larger than the creatures underneath it neither moves creatures nor becomes a catch, and instead forces the targets to pass a Reflex save or be knocked prone and buried underneath the object itself.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc6\"><span>Falling Weapons</span></h4>\n<p>Weapons deal their normal damage instead of their object size damage when dropped on a target and their damage is not multiplied for hardness, although it is still multiplied for distance. Falling weapons are never treated as indirect siege weapons, and always target AC rather than touch AC. Dropping a giant spike is the same as dropping a greatsword.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc7\"><span>Buried</span></h4>\n<p>When a target is buried in material, such as from large cloth objects as mentioned above, they suffer 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried, which becomes lethal damage when their nonlethal damage equals their hit points. A creature may clear material equal to five times their heavy load limit per minute, or per 30 seconds if using an appropriate tool such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel. The amount of stone or heavier material that fills a 5-foot-by-5-foot area weighs about 1 ton (2,000 pounds), with wood and softer materials such as cloth weight half that amount. A buried character cannot unbury itself, but may attempt to free itself with a Strength check or Escape Artist check against a DC equal to 5 + the Reflex save DC they failed that buried them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc8\"><span>Walls and Coverings</span></h4>\n<p>When creating walls, coverings, or other objects that are particularly thin but cover a large area, a section of 20-foot-by-20-foot cloth is considered a Small object (1 hit point), while a wall 10-foot-by-10-foot and 1 inch thick counts as a Small object. Adding spikes or other such decorations to a 10-foot-by-10-foot wall makes it count as a Medium object, and doubling the thickness of a wall or covering counts as doubling its size. When dropping a wall or covering onto an area, damage is dealt to all spaces the wall or covering strikes, but damage is determined by the thickness, rather than the overall size, of the object (dropping a spikeless wall 1-inch thick onto a target counts as striking them with a Small object, no matter how large the wall may actually be in total). Additionally, you cannot target specific creatures with a wall or covering; only splash damage can be dealt over the affected area. Coverings made of soft materials such as cloth dropped less than 30 feet do not deal damage.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc9\"><span>Spikes and Hazardous Ground</span></h4>\n<p>You may create spikes on an object or the ground that deal damage to targets who run into or pass over them. If a target is pushed onto spikes (such as through a successful bull rush) or steps onto them, make a touch attack roll against the target using your caster level as your attack bonus. If successful, the target suffers piercing damage equal to your caster level (minimum 1) and has its land speed reduced by half if the wound was administered to its feet. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours or until the creature is treated with a DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of fast healing/magical healing/regeneration. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it enters an area covered in spikes. A creature may move at half speed through this area without risking damage to itself. Spikes added to a dropped object do not increase the damage of the falling object, though spikes added to a wall count as increasing its size as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>When placing spikes or any other form of hazardous terrain directly underneath a target, they are allowed a Reflex saving throw. Success means they suffer no effect from the hazardous terrain in that square until the end of their next turn. Attempting to move into or through such hazardous squares affects the target normally. It is also possible, through certain talents, to create other forms of hazardous terrain, such as grease, ice, acid, or other materials. Hazardous terrain created in this fashion functions as normal for its kind.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc10\"><span>Catches, Nets, and Cages</span></h4>\n<p>A catch is any wall or covering larger than the target underneath it that is dropped on a target and then rests on top of them to impede their movement. A net is a catch made from cloth, rope, chains, or other pliable materials that is the same size as the target underneath it. A cage is a wall or covering that is wrapped around a target so as to impede their movement without dealing falling damage first.</p>\n<p>A net functions the same as the exotic weapon of the same name. A catch is similar to a net in that targets underneath it are entangled, but escaping a catch is as easy as moving out from underneath it, in addition to breaking it through dealing damage or making a Strength check.</p>\n<p>Cages, on the other hand, do not deal damage, but are also much harder to escape. While it is possible to box someone in with walls and a ceiling, if those walls are not at least 10 feet away from the target on all sides, the target is allowed a Reflex save to immediately move to the nearest unoccupied space on the outside of the cages. Creating a cage 1-inch thick that occupies the same space as a creature is considered the same as creating an object one size larger than the target creature. No matter how small a cage might be, a target may always make attack rolls and Strength checks unimpeded against any cage created around them (with the usual DC of 10 + the object’s Hardness +1 per inch in the item’s thickness), though the inside may be covered in spikes as a wall at the usual cost of increasing its effective size (or be coated in acid or other harmful materials if you possess the appropriate talents) to discourage such attacks and checks. Targets are not damaged by the material unless they make such attacks or checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc11\"><span>Creation Talent Types</span></h3>\n<p>Some Creation talents are designated (alter) talents. These grant you new ways to alter objects.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc12\"><span>Material</span></h4>\n<p>Some Creation talents are designated (material) talents.
