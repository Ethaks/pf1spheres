        <h2 id="toc0"><span>Divine</span></h2>

        <p>You may divine to gain information. To divine, you must spend 1
        minute meditating, although you may spend a spell point to decrease this
        time to a single standard action. Divining always has a duration of
        concentration, but you must spend a full-round action concentrating (you
        can take no other action except free actions); you are flat-footed while
        concentrating on divining. Divining reveals information from sources
        within medium range of you as an emanation; it reveals information each
        round the effect it is maintained. Divining can penetrate most barriers,
        but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or
        a thin sheet of lead blocks it.</p>

        <p>When you gain the Divination sphere, you gain the ability to divine
        for magical auras, learning their strength and location. You do not know
        the exact caster level of an item or spell, but you may sense the aura’s
        general strength according to the chart below. To determine the spell
        school or sphere of the effect, you must succeed at a Knowledge (arcana)
        check with a DC equal to 15 + 1/2 the caster level.</p>

        <p>A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the
        case of spells and sphere effects) or is destroyed (in the case of a
        magic item). In such a case, divining reveals an aura strength of dim
        (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim
        level depends on its original power:</p>

        may spend an additional spell point to also divine the location and size
        of shadows cast by creatures or objects. You do not gain additional
        information, such as whether the shadow was cast by a creature or an
        object, or the size of said creatures or objects.</p>

        <p><strong>Divine Shadow:</strong> You may divine the presence of
        creatures or objects native to the Plane of Shadow. In all other ways,
        this functions as divining for shapeshifters. Shadowstuff, such as that
        created from the fey adept class or those with the sphere-specific

        <p><strong>Divine Undead:</strong> You may divine for undead creatures.

        <p><strong>Divine Hostility:</strong> You may divine whenever a creature
        or an object within range takes hit point damage. In addition, you gain
        knowledge as to the amount and type of damage dealt and from what
        direction the damage was dealt from. If the source of the damage is
        inside the area of your divine effect, you also learn what square the
        source occupied.</p>

        <h3 id="toc9"><span>Enhancement</span></h3>

        <p><strong>Divine Enhancement:</strong> You may divine what short-term
        effects creatures you have pinpointed are undergoing. You may divine all
        creatures you can see within range and determine which (if any) are
        benefiting from temporary bonuses, and the sources of the bonuses be
        they magical, alchemical, supernatural, etc.</p>

        <p><strong>Detect Loyalties:</strong> You may divine the top three
        general things that matter most to the creatures you can see within
        range. Examples of base loyalties may include but are not limited to:
        Country, Faith, Family, Power, and Self. Subcategories for base
        loyalties may also exist where appropriate such as Self (survival) or
        Self (perfection), but they are generally not revealed with Detect
        Loyalties. While you do not learn specific details such as proper names
        of the associated loyalties, you do acquire the order in which the
        loyalties stand. For example, a paladin might have loyalties of Country,
        Power, and Self, but would not reveal the particular country they are
        loyal to or the particular power they serve. Mindless creatures might
        have only 1 loyalty such as Self (survival), whereas creatures with low
        animal-like intelligence might only have 2 loyalties such as Family
        (pack) and Self (survival). Only the top three loyalties are revealed,
        even if they have more.</p>

        <p><strong>Divine Alignment:</strong> You may divine for a specific part
        of the alignment spectrum: evil, good, lawful, or chaotic. The strength
        of these auras are determined according to Chart: Alignment.</p>

        <p>Traps, poisons, and other potential perils have no alignment.
        Creatures with aligned intents (killing in anger, aiding those in need
        for their own sakes, etc.) may temporarily detect according to their
        actions.</p>

        creatures you can see within range. Such creatures emit a colored aura
        depending upon what alignments or loyalties you share with them.
        Creatures that share the same moral alignment (good/neutral/evil) emit a
        red aura. Creatures that share the same ethical alignment
        (lawful/neutral/chaotic) emit a blue aura. Creatures that share a
        primary base loyalty (see Detect Loyalties) emit a yellow aura.
        Creatures that share multiple colors have their colors combined, i.e. a
        creature that shares the primary base loyalty of family and the ethical
        alignment of chaos will emit a green aura. Creatures that share all
        three primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) emit a glowing white aura.
        Refer to Table: Divine Fate below for more information on how colored

        <p><strong>Divine Cares Given [Jester's HB]:</strong> You may divine for
        a specific subject of interest, chosen when you divine. This is similar

        creatures with strong opinions about a specific topic or subject chosen
        when you divine, such as politics, war, entertainment, or professional
        associations. Creatures may have a positive, negative, or uninterested
        opinion regarding a subject. Only creatures with a positive or negative
        opinion are located. This effect does not discern what opinion each
        located creature may hold, only that the creature has an opinion.</p>

        <p>For example, divining about a specific criminal organization, both
        members of the organization and opposing factions may hold strong

        shapeshifters.</p>

        <h3 id="toc20"><span>Time</span></h3>

        <p><strong>Divine Time:</strong> You may divine the events that happened
        within range. You can only divine what occurred up to 1 hour per caster
        level in the past. When you divine time you are only given the following
        details: The number of creatures that were in the area, their size, how
        long they remained in the area, and any movements they made while in the
        area. In addition, if objects were left unattended or unattended objects
        were moved during this time, you learn the size and vague shape of such
        objects.</p>

        <h3 id="toc21"><span>War</span></h3>

        <p><strong>Divine Allegiance:</strong> You may target an individual
        within range which allows you to divine through mud, blood, sweat, and
        wear or tear upon cloth or armor as if such was not there, revealing any
        colors, patterns, or insignia it may have previously bore. In addition,
        other creatures within range of the target glows with a particular aura
        allowing the caster to know who they openly allied with and who are not.
        Creatures under the affect of mind-affecting effects (such as charms and
        compulsions) are shown to be loyal to their controller and their allies.
        This does not properly function on those who are using subterfuge or are
        pretending to be on someone’s side, as it will present them as who they
        pretend to side with. Once each round as a free action while maintaining
        concentration on this effect, you may target a different individual
        within range with this divine ability.</p>

        <h3 id="toc22"><span>Warp</span></h3>

        <p><strong>Divine Warp:</strong> You may divine the presence of portals,
        rifts (including extradimensional spaces), and teleportation circles,
        both active and inactive within range. If you perceived a target
        teleport within the last hour, this also reveals to you the general
        direction and distance of their teleportation. If the creature teleports
        to a different plane, you immediately learn this, but you do not learn
        to what plane the creature teleported unless your caster level is at
        least 10. Should you find yourself on that plane before the hour is up,
        you can divine their general direction and distance.</p>

        <h3 id="toc23"><span>Weather</span></h3>

        <p><strong>Divine Weather:</strong> You may divine the weather at your
        location for the next 24 hours, providing you with advance warning of
        storms, tornadoes, and so on. This reveals only the weather that would
        arise naturally and does not take into account any magical occurrences
        that might change the weather.</p>

        <h2 id="toc24"><span>Sense</span></h2>

        <p>As a standard action, you may grant yourself paranormal senses for 1
        hour/caster level. When you gain the Divination sphere, you gain the
        following sense.</p>

        <h4 id="toc25"><span>Read Magic</span></h4>

        <p>You may spend a spell point to gain a sense that allows you to
        decipher all magical writings, such as those found in books, scrolls, on
        weapons, or in other places intelligible to you. This does not invoke
        the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of
        a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once you have read a magical
        inscription through this ability, you are thereafter able to read that
        particular writing even without this sense. You can read at the rate of
        one page (250 words) per minute. You can identify glyphs, runes, and
        symbol spells with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + 1/2 caster level).</p>

        <h3 id="toc26"><span>Divination Talent Types</span></h3>

        <p>Some talents are marked (divine). These grant you different things
        you may divine for in place of magic.</p>

        <p>Some talents are marked (sense). These talents grant you additional
        senses you may grant.</p>
