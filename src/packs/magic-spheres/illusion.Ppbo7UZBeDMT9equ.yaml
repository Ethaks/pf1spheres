        <p>Illusion sphere abilities have a range of close, and unless stated
        otherwise, creatures who interact with an Illusion sphere ability may
        attempt a Will save to disbelieve.</p>

        <p>All Illusion sphere effects are either a figment or a glamer.</p>

        <p><strong>Figment:</strong> Illusions or tricks cast on an area are
        called figments and are transparent when disbelieved. You may choose to
        believe or disbelieve your own figments at will, even switching between
        the two once per round as a non-action, but not both at once. Figments
        are not subject to spell resistance. A figment may shed as much normal
        light as a torch and may cast a shadow.</p>

        <p>A figment may be created anywhere within your maximum illusion range
        without the need of line of sight nor line of effect, but requires line
        of sight to be moved, directed, or have its appearance altered after
        creation (all of which are done as either a standard action or as part
        of the action used to maintain via concentration). Figments can be moved
        at a speed of 20 feet + 5 feet per 5 caster levels per round and must
        remain within your maximum illusion range.</p>

        <p><strong>Glamer:</strong> Illusions or tricks cast on a creature or
        object are called glamers, and change the way the creature or object
        looks, smells, tastes, or otherwise interacts with the senses of others.
        The recipient of a glamer can see through the glamer and ignore its
        effects (for example, an invisible creature can still see itself, and
        while you could use Illusionary Disguise and Illusionary Touch x2 to
        make a glamer of someone on fire, that fire would not damage the wearer
        of the glamer itself). Unwilling targets may attempt a Will save to
        resist a glamer being placed upon them, and glamers are subject to spell
        resistance.</p>

        <p>Glamers remain on the creature or object they are placed upon
        regardless of how quickly the target moves or distance between them and
        the caster. A target can be the subject of multiple glamers at once, but
        not the same type of glamer multiple times; for example, if a target is
        wearing an Illusionary Disguise and becomes subject to another
        Illusionary Disguise, the caster of the second Illusionary Disguise must
        succeed at a magic skill check against the first glamer to replace it
        with their own.</p>

        <h2 id="toc0"><span>Illusion</span></h2>

        <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to create an
        illusion within close range. This illusion may be a figment or a glamer,
        and has a duration of concentration, to a maximum of 1 minute per caster
        level. By default, these illusions are visual only. You cannot move
        further away from the illusion than your illusion range while
        maintaining it through concentration, and the illusion is limited in
        size according to Table: Illusion Maximum Size.</p>

        <p><strong>Figments:</strong> You may create an illusion that is a
        figment of anything you may clearly imagine, which behaves according to
        your desires.</p>

        <p><strong>Glamers:</strong> You may create an illusion that is a
        glamer. The maximum size of creature you may apply this glamer to is
        determined by your illusion maximum size.</p>

        <p>When you gain this base sphere, you gain the following type of
        glamer:</p>

        <h4 id="toc1"><span>Illusionary Disguise</span></h4>

        <p>You may create a glamer that makes a creature or object appear as
        something else. This allows you to attempt a Disguise check as part of
        casting the glamer, even without a disguise kit. This disguise is
        magical for the purposes of detecting magic or for spells and effects
        that allow a target to see through magical effects and illusions, and
        interacting with it allows for a Will save to disbelieve.</p>

        <p>You may disguise a target as something larger than itself (up to your
        maximum illusion size) but can only make something appear to be one size
        smaller than it actually is.</p>

        <h3 id="toc2"><span>Special Considerations</span></h3>

        <p><strong>Disbelief and Interaction:</strong> When a creature interacts
        with an illusion, they may attempt a Will save to disbelieve. Generally
        speaking, simply observing an illusion is not enough; in order to
        ‘interact’ with an illusion a creature may spend a move action to
        carefully study the illusion. Additionally, any action that requires at
        least a move action and similarly engages directly with the illusion
        counts as interaction.</p>

        <p>For example, if there were a figment of a dragon, a character who
        tried to attack the dragon would receive a saving throw to disbelieve,
        as would a character who spent 1 minute attempting a Diplomacy check on
        the dragon. A character who just traded witty banter with the dragon as
        a free action would not, nor would a character who simply cast spells on
        herself or her allies and never directly confronted the illusory
        dragon.</p>

        <p>For a glamer, interacting generally works the same as for a figment,
        except that the interaction must be limited to something the glamer
        affects. For instance, grabbing a creature’s ear would be an interaction
        for a human using disguise self to appear as an elf, but not for someone
        using a glamer to change their hair color. Similarly, visually studying
        someone would not grant a save against a glamer that purely changed
        their voice.</p>

        <p>Additionally, if you or a creature who has made their saving throw
        against one of your illusions declares that the illusion is, indeed, an
        illusion, other creatures so informed gain an automatic saving throw
        against the illusion. While multiple declarations from multiple
        creatures can produce multiple saving throws, only one saving throw can
        be generated per illusion by any single creature; if a declaration was
        unconvincing, the same person simply insisting again is not helpful.</p>

        <p><strong>Sustained Disbelief:</strong> Allies do not automatically
        disbelieve your illusions, but if they have been informed about and are
        familiar with your particular artistry and illusion style they gain a +5
        circumstance bonus to all saves made to disbelieve your illusions. You
        may suppress this bonus by changing your personal style if you so
        desire.</p>

        <p>Creatures who successfully identify a sphere effect as belonging to
        the Illusion sphere as it is being cast, such as with a Spellcraft check
        or detect magic spell (or similar ability), also gain this +5
        circumstance bonus to any Will saves made to disbelieve that
        illusion.</p>

        <p>If the GM feels it is appropriate, a creature who has interacted with
        multiple illusions in a day (especially if they have come from the same
        illusionist), might gain this bonus as well, to reflect how they are
        looking for patterns and checking and double-checking everything in
        front of them to avoid being fooled ‘again’. This bonus would not apply
        when taking 10, taking 20, and would disallow checking a location
        multiple times in a row; double-checking is reflected in the bonus.</p>

        <p><strong>Multiple Senses:</strong> By default, the only sense that can
        be affected by a basic illusion is sight. However, certain talents
        marked with as (sensory) talents allow the caster to create illusions
        that also produce illusionary sound, taste, smell, or even touch.</p>

        <p>The more complex an illusion is, the more talents it requires to be
        convincing, with the chart below serving as a guideline and the GM
        serving as the final arbiter for what talents are required to create a
        specific illusion. Creating an illusion without the necessary (sensory)
        talents often leads to disbelief; whenever a creature interacts with an
        illusion in a way that requires a (sensory) talent it does not possess,
        they may attempt a Will save to disbelieve with a +5 bonus. This bonus
        is cumulative for each missing (sensory) talent. This is in addition to
        simply learning the sensory experience is not there (for example, if a
        creature walks through an illusionary wall they will learn they can pass
        through that wall whether or not they discover the reason why is that
        the wall is illusionary).</p>

        <p>If the GM deems it appropriate, certain other situations might allow
        a target to gain a similar +5 bonus to their Will saves (for example, a
        creature being damaged by illusionary ‘fire’ that is normally immune to
        fire damage).</p>

        <p><strong>Cover and Concealment:</strong> Figments and glamers provide
        concealment if they block line of sight. A figment of a wall, for
        example, would grant total concealment unless the attacker disbelieved
        the illusion, whereas a figment of fog would only grant partial
        concealment.</p>

        <p>Glamers that are used to change the size of a creature to appear
        larger than it is grants a 10% miss chance for each size increase due to
        concealment. If a creature is glamered to appear larger and its larger
        size would provide a cover bonus to another target, it instead grants
        this same concealment bonus to miss chance.</p>

        <p>Glamers and figments with the shadow descriptor which grant a miss
        chance or concealment also grant soft cover.</p>

        <p><strong>Illusionary Creatures:</strong> If creating an illusionary
        creature, your illusion has an attack bonus equal to your caster level +
        your casting ability modifier, and an AC and touch AC equal to 10 + its
        size modifier + 1/2 your caster level + your casting ability modifier.
        An illusionary creature may provide a flanking bonus against targets who
        fail to disbelieve it. Any creature who strikes an illusionary creature
        in combat (unless augmented by Illusionary Touch) receives the standard
        +5 circumstance bonus to disbelieve it, and any creature struck by the
        illusionary creature receives the same bonus (unless augmented by
        Illusionary Touch 2x). All actions that an illusionary creature performs
        must be contained within the figment of the illusion that created it,
        regardless of the size of the illusionary creature itself.</p>

        <p><strong>Powerful Senses:</strong> Senses such as see in darkness,
        x-ray vision, mistsight, or greensight that are designed to penetrate
        specific sorts of occlusion or display vision differently do not
        automatically interact with illusions the way they do unaltered reality,
        and thus tricking a character with such a sense is a difficult task, but
        not impossible. For example, when creating an illusionary wall to fool a
        creature with x-ray vision, one could create an illusion that ‘looks’
        like a wall being looked through with x-ray vision. However, creating an
        illusion that would trick such senses can create obvious signs of
        trickery with those that do not possess that sight (for example, the
        illusion of a forest would look suspicious to a character with
        greensight if he could not see through it, but making the illusionary
        forest transparent would look suspicious to any of their allies who do
        not possess greensight). The Selective Illusions talent can be helpful
        in overcoming this problem in certain situations.</p>

        <p><strong>Complex and Exotic Senses:</strong> Illusions can foil all
        forms of perception, even unusual forms that a creature might
        possess.</p>

        <p>Use the following list when dealing with unusual senses.</p>

        <ul>

        <li><strong>Blindsense:</strong> Illusionary Odor and Illusionary
        Sound</li>

        <li><strong>Blindsight:</strong> Illusionary Odor, Illusionary Sound,
        and Illusionary Touch</li>

        <li><strong>Detect Magic:</strong> Manipulate Aura</li>

        <li><strong>Echolocation:</strong> Illusionary Sound through air,
        Illusionary Touch through water</li>

        <li><strong>Scent or Keen Scent:</strong> Illusionary Odor</li>

        <li><strong>Lifesense:</strong> Manipulate Aura, Illusionary Touch</li>

        <li><strong>Thoughtsense or Detect Thoughts:</strong> Implausible
        Deniability feat</li>

        <li><strong>Tremorsense:</strong> Illusionary Touch</li>

        </ul>

        <p>For figments, if you do not possess all of the indicated (sensory)
        talents required to convincingly create the illusion, creatures with
        that sense are automatically treated as interacting with your figment
        the first time the figment comes within range of that sense, and any
        Will save made to disbelieve the figment while within range of that
        sense is made with the standard +5 circumstance bonus for each missing
        talent.</p>

        <p>For glamers, every sensory talent you lack to fool the listed sense
        causes the creature affected by that glamer to suffer a -2 penalty to
        any skill bonus or Disguise check granted by that glamer vs. that
        creature, and reduces any miss chance granted by the glamer by 10%. If
        the skill bonus or miss chance is reduced to zero, the creature may
        ignore all other effects of the glamer.</p>

        <p>For Suppressions, if all senses that make up the complex sense are
        suppressed by the effect, the complex sense fails to penetrate that
        area.</p>

        <h2 id="toc3"><span>Trick</span></h2>

        <p>As a standard action, you may create small, simple illusions called
        tricks. Unless otherwise stated, a trick persists for 1 minute per level
        or until dismissed.</p>

        <h4 id="toc4"><span>Minor Figments</span></h4>

        <p>You may create unconvincing figments. This is the same as creating an
        illusion and can include all senses you can affect through (sense)
        talents, except it is obviously fake (i.e., it is translucent,
        unrealistic, etc.), requiring no one to attempt a Will save to
        disbelieve. However, the effects can still be used to create
        distractions, display images, draw a map, or be used for entertainment.
        This counts as possessing the required tools to attempt any appropriate
        Perform check (such as creating a melody with the Illusionary Sound
        talent).</p>

        <h4 id="toc5"><span>Minor Glamers</span></h4>

        <p>You may make minor changes to objects or creatures up to your
        illusion maximum size, such as changing their color, making them appear
        clean or dirty, making writing appear, or other minor alterations.</p>

        <h3 id="toc6"><span>Illusion Talent Types</span></h3>

        <p>Some talents are marked (glamer). These talents grant you additional
        glamers you can bestow.</p>

        <h4 id="toc7"><span>Sensory</span></h4>

        <p>Sensory talents are talents that modify all illusions by expanding
        what senses are able to be modified, created or subverted.</p>

        <p>The sense added is also noted in the tag.</p>
