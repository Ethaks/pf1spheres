  "content": "You have made contracts with outsiders, calling them to your side when you are in need.\n<h2 id=\"toc0\"><span>Summon</span></h2>\n<p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to summon a creature you have made a contract with (called a companion) causing it to appear in an adjacent square, ready to act on your following turn. You must concentrate to maintain the companion’s presence, but may always spend an additional spell point to allow the summoned creature to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.</p>\n<p>Companions can take many forms; a caster could contract with sympathetic angels or demons, elemental spirits, or primordial beings only given form after the contract is made. Thus, a companion could have the form of a knight in armor, a demonic dog, a flying anthropomorphic cat, or indeed virtually any other form. You cannot choose a companion with the exact same appearance as another creature.</p>\n<p>When you gain the Conjuration sphere, you automatically gain a single companion of your choice. If a companion is conjured multiple times during a day, they do not regain hit points or other resources spent. If a companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they instantly disappear and cannot be summoned until the following day.</p>\n<p>A companion only recovers hit points and resources (unless restored through the Heal skill or magical means) when the caster rests to recover spell points. A companion may be dismissed as a free action.</p>\n<p>Companions may not carry equipment or items back and forth when summoned and so cannot be used to store items in their home plane or bring items to the caster’s plane. The exception to this rule is equipment gained through Conjuration talents, which automatically accompany the companion. Whenever you gain a companion, they immediately gain 1 (form) or (type) talent of your choice.</p>\n<p>Every companion comes with one of the following base forms, chosen by the caster. Once made, this choice cannot be altered. Companions also gain power as their caster’s power grows, according to Table: Companion.</p>\n<p>(Note: A companion does not gain power from temporary increases to caster level; i.e., from a thaumaturge’s forbidden lore ability or from certain boons.)</p>\n<strong>Table: Companion</strong><br />\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Caster’s Caster Level</th>\n<th>Hit

An avian companion has a head, 2 legs, and 2 wings</p>\n<p>*This fly speed only functions on the companion’s turn. If the companion is not on a surface that can support it on the end of its turn, it glides to the ground, taking no falling damage. If the companion gains a natural fly speed from the Avian Creature (form) talent, increase the maneuverability of that speed by 1 step.</p>\n<p><strong>Biped</strong><br />\n<strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (good), Ref (bad), Will (good); <strong>Attack</strong> 2 slams (1d4); <strong>Str</strong> 16, <strong>Dex</strong> 12, <strong>Con</strong> 13, <strong>Int</strong> 7, <strong>Wis</strong> 10, <strong>Cha</strong> 11</p>\n<p>Bipeds are usually humanoids, and begin with 2 legs, 2 arms, and a head.</p>\n<p><strong>Ooze</strong><br />\n<strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +4 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (good), Ref (bad), Will (bad); <strong>Attack</strong> slam (primary, 1d6 Medium, 1d4 Small); <strong>Str</strong> 16, <strong>Dex</strong> 8, <strong>Con</strong> 16, <strong>Int</strong> 7, <strong>Wis</strong> 12, <strong>Cha</strong> 11.</p>\n<p>Ooze creatures are usually oozes, puddings, or other amorphous creatures and lack discernable limbs.

An orb lacks any limbs, but may treat its body as a head for the purpose of adding natural attacks. An orb companion may not be tripped unless gaining legs from another source.<br />\n*An orb may float up to 5 feet plus 5 feet per 5 Hit Dice above the ground, with a horizontal movement speed of 30 feet. When floating this way, Fly checks are not required to hover or change direction. When falling the orb may choose to descend at a slower rate to control its fall and to negate all falling damage it would take. Each round it descends 30 feet, and may move in another direction for 30 feet. It may choose to drift sideways, gliding forwards while descending, or down, safely increasing its rate of descent. It may even choose to drift ‘upwards’ to reduce its rate of descent, even allowing it to negate it entirely and hover midair (though cannot move horizontally if it begins its turn doing so). This is a supernatural ability.<br />\n^The Skillful Companion (form) talent increases Int to 13 if taken.</p>\n<p><strong>Quadruped</strong><br />\n<strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6); <strong>Str</strong> 14, <strong>Dex</strong> 14, <strong>Con</strong> 13, <strong>Int</strong> 7, <strong>Wis</strong> 10, <strong>Cha</strong> 11</p>\n<p>Quadrupeds are usually beasts, and begin with 4 legs and a head.</p>\n<p><strong>Serpentine</strong><br />\n<strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +4 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (bad), Ref (good), Will (good); <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6), tail slap (1d6); <strong>Str</strong> 12, <strong>Dex</strong> 16, <strong>Con</strong> 13, <strong>Int</strong> 7, <strong>Wis</strong> 10, <strong>Cha</strong> 11</p>\n<p>Serpentine creatures are snakes, fish, and other elongated creatures.

In this case, the companion gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity, a -2 penalty to Strength, as well as the usual changes for being Small (+4 Stealth bonus, +1 AC, +1 to-hit, decreased damage size, etc.).</p>\n<p>A companion gains 2 skill points per level (reduced to 1 for low Intelligence) and gains the following class skills: Climb (Str), Fly (Dex), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str). They possess a d10 Hit Die and gain 2 good saves and 1 bad save dependent on the creature’s form. A companion begins understanding and speaking one language that the caster also speaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats:</strong> A companion begins with one feat, and gains another feat at every odd Hit Die. A companion may gain any PC or monster feat for which it qualifies. While a companion may gain casting abilities through feats such as Basic Magic Training or Advanced Magic Training, a companion can never possess the Conjuration sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Evasion:</strong> At 2 Hit Dice, a companion gains evasion, taking no damage on a successful Reflex save against an effect that grants half damage on a successful Reflex save. At 11 Hit Dice, they gain improved evasion, only take half damage on failed Reflex saves against effects that grant half damage on a successful Reflex save.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Just like PCs and monsters, a companion gains a permanent +1 bonus to an ability score of the caster’s choice for every 4 Hit Dice possessed.</p>\n<p><strong>Devotion:</strong> At 5 Hit Dice, a companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against charm and enchantment effects, such as enchantment school spells or the Mind sphere.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiattack:</strong> At 7 Hit Dice, a companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has 3 or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more natural attacks (or it is reduced to less than 3 attacks), the companion instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a –5 penalty. If the companion later gains 3 or more natural attacks, it loses this additional attack and instead gains Multiattack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"toc2\"><span>Companion Archetypes</span></h2>\n<p>Upon gaining a Conjuration sphere companion, you may select archetypes to apply to it. Once selected, the archetype cannot be removed from that companion. Each companion may have different archetypes. A companion may have more than one archetype as long as the archetypes do not replace or modify the same features or abilities.</p>\n<p>Multiple changes to the cost to summon a companion stack (so a companion with the familiar and puppet archetypes would have its cost to summon reduced by 3).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>Aquatic</span></h4>\n<p>Your companion reduces one of its speeds by 20 feet and gains a 20 feet swim speed. Companions with a base form that grants a speed of less than 20 feet are not eligible for this archetype. If this companion later gains the Water Being (form) talent, increase the swim speed granted by that talent by +10 feet.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Beast</span></h4>\n<p>Your companion has an animal intellect, with its starting Intelligence reduced to 2. A bestial companion may not have its Intelligence raised by any (form) talent (though may still receive other benefits from such talents). Bestial companions count as possessing the animal creature type in addition to the outsider creature type for all skills and effects and require the use of the Handle Animal skill to direct. Without direction, they are friendly to the creature that summoned them but otherwise act according to their nature. A bestial companion gains an additional free (form) talent. A companion that has this companion archetype may not also possess the mindless or puppet companion archetypes. A bestial companion begins play trained for one purpose (see the Handle Animal skill) plus gains 1 bonus trick, +1 at 3 Hit Dice and every 3 Hit Dice thereafter. If using Spheres of Might, your bestial companion counts as an animal ally, though is not a valid target for the tame ability (per the rules in the Beastmastery sphere).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc5\"><span>Distinct Kin [DbH]</span></h4>\n<p>Any companions you gain from the Conjuration sphere may be treated as having a single subtype of your choice corresponding to a specific family of creatures that share their alignment (such as angel, demon, or devil). This does not grant the companion the abilities of that subtype, but they count as creatures of that subtype for the purpose of determining how abilities affect them. In addition, they learn one language spoken by creatures of their subtype.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc6\"><span>Familiar</span></h4>\n<p>Your companion only gains half its normal Hit Dice (rounded down), effectively treating your caster level as half what it is when determining its abilities, but has the spell point cost to summon it reduced by 2 (minimum 0). If the companion would normally only have 1 Hit Die, it still has 1 Hit Die, but receives half its normal hit points (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc7\"><span>Mage</span></h4>\n<p>Your companion gains poor base attack bonus progression (equal to 1/2 Hit Dice, rounded down) and uses a d6 for its Hit Dice. The companion must choose the Magical Companion (form) talent as its free (form) talent, but is not required to use natural casting, and may gain a casting tradition of your choice. The companion is considered a Mid-Caster, and gains spell points equal to its Hit Dice plus its casting ability modifier.</p>\n<p>A mage companion must still spend feats to gain additional magic talents, as usual, and does not gain the two free bonus talents a caster usually gains with the casting class feature. A mage companion loses Climb and Swim as class skills but gains Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft as class skills. A mage companion may choose to give up the natural attacks granted by its base form to gain the Implement Bearer (form) talent as a bonus talent. This archetype cannot be combined with the mindless companion archetype.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc8\"><span><span style=\"color:#993300\">Martial Companion</span></span></h4>\n<p>This archetype requires Spheres of Might. A martial companion may combine combat spheres and talents to create powerful martial techniques. Martial companions use the Proficient talent progression. When first summoned, they may choose either Charisma, Intelligence or Wisdom as their practitioner modifier. A martial companion does not gain the evasion, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion special abilities. A martial companion may choose to give up the natural attacks granted by its base form to gain the Battle Creature (form) talent as a bonus talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> This does not inherently grant a martial tradition, although some companions may qualify to trade things for a martial tradition.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc9\"><span>Mindless</span></h4>\n<p>Your Conjuration sphere companion is mindless; it has no Intelligence score (Int —) and cannot gain any (form) talents that would increase its Intelligence score. It gains no feats or skill points and cannot speak, though it is still capable of following your simple instructions. A mindless companion is immune to mind-affecting effects. A mindless companion can receive bonus feats and skill ranks to a specific skill from talents such as Capable Companion and Camouflaged Companion.</p>\n<p>The companion gains an additional Hit Die at 4th caster level and every 4 caster levels thereafter.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc10\"><span>Puppet</span></h4>\n<p>Your Conjuration sphere companion is incapable of action without your direct control. You must spend an action for your companion to take the same action (swift for swift, standard for standard, etc.). A puppet companion may make attacks of opportunity by spending your attacks of opportunity if you have controlled it since the beginning of your last turn. Spending at least a move action this way counts as concentrating on the summon for that round. Any round you do not spend directing the companion, it stands mindlessly and counts as having the dazed condition. Your companion may still gain feats and skills (unless also possessing the mindless archetype); you may use the companion’s feats, skills, casting, and other abilities when directing the companion, though you may not use your own through the companion. Any effect that would possess or exercise mental control over a puppet companion (including enchantment charm effects and enchantment compulsion effects) requires a successful magical skill check against the summoner’s MSD. A puppet companion takes a -2 penalty on all rolls if it is outside of your close range. If you do not have line of sight to the puppet companion, it is treated as being blinded. Both these penalties are removed if you possess the Link talent.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, you may order a puppet companion to follow. Doing so causes the puppet to take move actions on its turn (including trading its standard action for a move action) to attempt to move adjacent to you (or as close as it is able) to the best of its ability. Should the companion be unable to find you (such as in a complex maze when you are out of sight for too long, if you are teleported out of view, etc.), the companion will remain in its current position. Taking any other action through the companion ends this ability. The spell point cost of summoning a puppet companion is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc11\"><span>Unwilling [Apoc]</span></h4>\n<p><sup><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/297259/Spheres-Apocrypha-Cohorts-and-Companions?affiliate_id=549120\">Spheres Apocrypha: Cohorts &amp; Companions</a></sup></p>\n<p>Your Conjuration sphere companion serves you unwillingly. Whenever you summon the companion, the first time you or it rolls for initiative during a combat encounter, or whenever you are engaged in an activity that requires a skill check and more then 1 round to accomplish (such as crafting items, recuperating, or researching rituals), it must attempt a Will saving throw against your Conjuration sphere DC. If the companion fails the Will save, you establish control over the companion.</p>\n<p>As long as you have control over your companion it obeys your commands and treats you as friendly for the purposes of the Handle Animal skill (if it possesses the bestial archetype). However if the companion succeeds on its Will save (you are not informed if it succeeds) the companion breaks free from your control and seeks revenge against you. A creature free from your control cannot be dismissed as a free action, and remains summoned for the remainder of its normal duration plus an additional minute per caster level.</p>\n<p>You may expend a spell point as a standard action to force the companion to attempt another Will save. If it fails the Will save, it is dismissed. The companion gains an additional Hit Die at 4th caster level and every 4 caster levels thereafter.</p>\n<p>A Conjuration sphere companion cannot possess both this archetype and the Puppet archetype.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc12\"><span>Warrior</span></h4>\n<p>This archetype may only be applied to bipedal companions. Your companion loses all natural attacks granted by its base form and never gains multiattack, but gains the benefits of the Battle Creature (form) talent taken twice. A companion with this archetype may never benefit from (form) talents that modify or grant natural attacks, though may still make unarmed strikes and benefit from feats and abilities that affect unarmed strikes as normal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc13\"><span>Conjuration Talent Types</span></h3>\n<p>Some talents are marked (form). Whenever you select a (form) talent, apply its effects to only a single companion. You may select (form) talents multiple times, but no more than once per companion, unless the talent says otherwise.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc14\"><span>Type Talents</span></h3>\n<p>A (type) talent counts as a (form) talent in all ways, except that an individual companion may only benefit from a single talent with the (type) descriptor (though an individual (type) talent may still be taken multiple times if so noted). A (type) talent might change the companion’s creature type to a creature type stated in the talent, although it retains the (extraplanar) subtype. This does not change Hit Dice, skills, or grant any other benefits associated with the creature type in question, but the creature does count as the new type for all interactions such as what magic can affect it.</p>\n<hr /><br />\n<br /><b>Conjuration Talents</b><br /><ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1spheres.magic-talents.nBfVyGgx4cLxeXat]{Call The
