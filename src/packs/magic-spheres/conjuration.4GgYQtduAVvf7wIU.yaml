        with outsiders, calling them to your side when you are in need.

        <h2 id="toc0"><span>Summon</span></h2>

        <p>As a standard action, you may spend a spell point to summon a
        creature you have made a contract with (called a companion) causing it
        to appear in an adjacent square, ready to act on your following turn.
        You must concentrate to maintain the companion’s presence, but may
        always spend an additional spell point to allow the summoned creature to
        remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.</p>

        <p>Companions can take many forms; a caster could contract with
        sympathetic angels or demons, elemental spirits, or primordial beings
        only given form after the contract is made. Thus, a companion could have
        the form of a knight in armor, a demonic dog, a flying anthropomorphic
        cat, or indeed virtually any other form. You cannot choose a companion
        with the exact same appearance as another creature.</p>

        <p>When you gain the Conjuration sphere, you automatically gain a single
        companion of your choice. If a companion is conjured multiple times
        during a day, they do not regain hit points or other resources spent. If
        a companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they instantly disappear and
        cannot be summoned until the following day.</p>

        <p>A companion only recovers hit points and resources (unless restored
        through the Heal skill or magical means) when the caster rests to
        recover spell points. A companion may be dismissed as a free action.</p>

        <p>Companions may not carry equipment or items back and forth when
        summoned and so cannot be used to store items in their home plane or
        bring items to the caster’s plane. The exception to this rule is
        equipment gained through Conjuration talents, which automatically
        accompany the companion. Whenever you gain a companion, they immediately
        gain 1 (form) or (type) talent of your choice.</p>

        <p>Every companion comes with one of the following base forms, chosen by
        the caster. Once made, this choice cannot be altered. Companions also
        gain power as their caster’s power grows, according to Table:
        Companion.</p>

        <p>(Note: A companion does not gain power from temporary increases to
        caster level; i.e., from a thaumaturge’s forbidden lore ability or from
        certain boons.)</p>

        <p>Avian creatures are birds and bird-like magical beasts and outsiders.
        An avian companion has a head, 2 legs, and 2 wings</p>

        <p>*This fly speed only functions on the companion’s turn. If the
        companion is not on a surface that can support it on the end of its
        turn, it glides to the ground, taking no falling damage. If the
        companion gains a natural fly speed from the Avian Creature (form)

        <p>Ooze creatures are usually oozes, puddings, or other amorphous
        creatures and lack discernable limbs. An ooze companion may not be
        tripped unless gaining legs from another source.</p>

        <p><strong>Orb</strong><br />

        <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 5 ft. Hover*, 30
        ft. (average); <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor;
        <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (bad), Ref (good), Will (good);
        <strong>Attack</strong> bite or slam (choose 1) (1d6);
        <strong>Str</strong> 7, <strong>Dex</strong> 16, <strong>Con</strong>

        <p>Orb creatures are lantern archons, will-o-wisps, gibbering orbs, and
        other mystical fey, outsiders, constructs, or aberrations with a
        floating sphere-like appearance and supernatural movement. An orb lacks
        any limbs, but may treat its body as a head for the purpose of adding
        natural attacks. An orb companion may not be tripped unless gaining legs
        from another source.<br />

        *An orb may float up to 5 feet plus 5 feet per 5 Hit Dice above the
        ground, with a horizontal movement speed of 30 feet. When floating this
        way, Fly checks are not required to hover or change direction. When
        falling the orb may choose to descend at a slower rate to control its
        fall and to negate all falling damage it would take. Each round it
        descends 30 feet, and may move in another direction for 30 feet. It may
        choose to drift sideways, gliding forwards while descending, or down,
        safely increasing its rate of descent. It may even choose to drift
        ‘upwards’ to reduce its rate of descent, even allowing it to negate it
        entirely and hover midair (though cannot move horizontally if it begins
        its turn doing so). This is a supernatural ability.<br />

        ^The Skillful Companion (form) talent increases Int to 13 if taken.</p>

        <p><strong>Quadruped</strong><br />

        <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 40 ft.;
        <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort
        (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6);
        <strong>Str</strong> 14, <strong>Dex</strong> 14, <strong>Con</strong>
        13, <strong>Int</strong> 7, <strong>Wis</strong> 10,
        <strong>Cha</strong> 11</p>

        <p>Quadrupeds are usually beasts, and begin with 4 legs and a head.</p>

        <p><strong>Serpentine</strong><br />

        <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft.;
        <strong>AC</strong> +4 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (bad),
        Ref (good), Will (good); <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6), tail slap
        (1d6); <strong>Str</strong> 12, <strong>Dex</strong> 16,
        <strong>Con</strong> 13, <strong>Int</strong> 7, <strong>Wis</strong>
        10, <strong>Cha</strong> 11</p>

        <p>Serpentine creatures are snakes, fish, and other elongated creatures.
        They begin with a head, but no arms or legs.</p>

        <p><strong>Vermin</strong><br />

        <strong>Size</strong> Medium; <strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft., Climb 20
        ft.; <strong>AC</strong> +2 natural armor; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort
        (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); <strong>Attack</strong> bite (1d6);
        <strong>Str</strong> 12, <strong>Dex</strong> 16, <strong>Con</strong>
        13, <strong>Int</strong> 7, <strong>Wis</strong> 10,
        <strong>Cha</strong> 11</p>

        <p>Vermin are usually insects or arachnids, and begin with either 6 or 8
        legs and a head and gain a +6 bonus to CMD vs. trip attempts from its
        additional legs.</p>

        <h3 id="toc1"><span>Companion Features</span></h3>

        <p>You may choose to make a companion Small-sized instead of
        Medium-sized. In this case, the companion gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity,
        a -2 penalty to Strength, as well as the usual changes for being Small
        (+4 Stealth bonus, +1 AC, +1 to-hit, decreased damage size, etc.).</p>

        <p>A companion gains 2 skill points per level (reduced to 1 for low
        Intelligence) and gains the following class skills: Climb (Str), Fly
        (Dex), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Stealth (Dex), Swim (Str). They possess
        a d10 Hit Die and gain 2 good saves and 1 bad save dependent on the
        creature’s form. A companion begins understanding and speaking one
        language that the caster also speaks.</p>

        <p><strong>Feats:</strong> A companion begins with one feat, and gains
        another feat at every odd Hit Die. A companion may gain any PC or
        monster feat for which it qualifies. While a companion may gain casting
        abilities through feats such as Basic Magic Training or Advanced Magic
        Training, a companion can never possess the Conjuration sphere.</p>

        <p><strong>Evasion:</strong> At 2 Hit Dice, a companion gains evasion,
        taking no damage on a successful Reflex save against an effect that
        grants half damage on a successful Reflex save. At 11 Hit Dice, they
        gain improved evasion, only take half damage on failed Reflex saves
        against effects that grant half damage on a successful Reflex save.</p>

        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Just like PCs and monsters,
        a companion gains a permanent +1 bonus to an ability score of the
        caster’s choice for every 4 Hit Dice possessed.</p>

        <p><strong>Devotion:</strong> At 5 Hit Dice, a companion gains a +4
        morale bonus on Will saves against charm and enchantment effects, such
        as enchantment school spells or the Mind sphere.</p>

        <p><strong>Multiattack:</strong> At 7 Hit Dice, a companion gains
        Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has 3 or more natural attacks and does
        not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more
        natural attacks (or it is reduced to less than 3 attacks), the companion
        instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at
        a –5 penalty. If the companion later gains 3 or more natural attacks, it
        loses this additional attack and instead gains Multiattack.</p>

        <hr />

        <h2 id="toc2"><span>Companion Archetypes</span></h2>

        <p>Upon gaining a Conjuration sphere companion, you may select
        archetypes to apply to it. Once selected, the archetype cannot be
        removed from that companion. Each companion may have different
        archetypes. A companion may have more than one archetype as long as the
        archetypes do not replace or modify the same features or abilities.</p>

        <p>Multiple changes to the cost to summon a companion stack (so a
        companion with the familiar and puppet archetypes would have its cost to
        summon reduced by 3).</p>

        <h4 id="toc3"><span>Aquatic</span></h4>

        <p>Your companion reduces one of its speeds by 20 feet and gains a 20
        feet swim speed. Companions with a base form that grants a speed of less
        than 20 feet are not eligible for this archetype. If this companion
        later gains the Water Being (form) talent, increase the swim speed
        granted by that talent by +10 feet.</p>

        <h4 id="toc4"><span>Beast</span></h4>

        <p>Your companion has an animal intellect, with its starting
        Intelligence reduced to 2. A bestial companion may not have its
        Intelligence raised by any (form) talent (though may still receive other
        benefits from such talents). Bestial companions count as possessing the
        animal creature type in addition to the outsider creature type for all
        skills and effects and require the use of the Handle Animal skill to
        direct. Without direction, they are friendly to the creature that
        summoned them but otherwise act according to their nature. A bestial
        companion gains an additional free (form) talent. A companion that has
        this companion archetype may not also possess the mindless or puppet
        companion archetypes. A bestial companion begins play trained for one
        purpose (see the Handle Animal skill) plus gains 1 bonus trick, +1 at 3
        Hit Dice and every 3 Hit Dice thereafter. If using Spheres of Might,
        your bestial companion counts as an animal ally, though is not a valid
        target for the tame ability (per the rules in the Beastmastery
        sphere).</p>

        <h4 id="toc5"><span>Distinct Kin [DbH]</span></h4>

        <p>Any companions you gain from the Conjuration sphere may be treated as
        having a single subtype of your choice corresponding to a specific
        family of creatures that share their alignment (such as angel, demon, or
        devil). This does not grant the companion the abilities of that subtype,
        but they count as creatures of that subtype for the purpose of
        determining how abilities affect them. In addition, they learn one
        language spoken by creatures of their subtype.</p>

        <h4 id="toc6"><span>Familiar</span></h4>

        <p>Your companion only gains half its normal Hit Dice (rounded down),
        effectively treating your caster level as half what it is when
        determining its abilities, but has the spell point cost to summon it
        reduced by 2 (minimum 0). If the companion would normally only have 1
        Hit Die, it still has 1 Hit Die, but receives half its normal hit points
        (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>

        <h4 id="toc7"><span>Mage</span></h4>

        <p>Your companion gains poor base attack bonus progression (equal to 1/2
        Hit Dice, rounded down) and uses a d6 for its Hit Dice. The companion
        must choose the Magical Companion (form) talent as its free (form)
        talent, but is not required to use natural casting, and may gain a
        casting tradition of your choice. The companion is considered a
        Mid-Caster, and gains spell points equal to its Hit Dice plus its
        casting ability modifier.</p>

        <p>A mage companion must still spend feats to gain additional magic
        talents, as usual, and does not gain the two free bonus talents a caster
        usually gains with the casting class feature. A mage companion loses
        Climb and Swim as class skills but gains Knowledge (arcana) and
        Spellcraft as class skills. A mage companion may choose to give up the
        natural attacks granted by its base form to gain the Implement Bearer
        (form) talent as a bonus talent. This archetype cannot be combined with
        the mindless companion archetype.</p>

        <h4 id="toc8"><span><span style="color:#993300">Martial
        Companion</span></span></h4>

        <p>This archetype requires Spheres of Might. A martial companion may
        combine combat spheres and talents to create powerful martial
        techniques. Martial companions use the Proficient talent progression.
        When first summoned, they may choose either Charisma, Intelligence or
        Wisdom as their practitioner modifier. A martial companion does not gain
        the evasion, devotion, multiattack, and improved evasion special
        abilities. A martial companion may choose to give up the natural attacks
        granted by its base form to gain the Battle Creature (form) talent as a
        bonus talent.</p>

        <p><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> This does not inherently grant a martial
        tradition, although some companions may qualify to trade things for a
        martial tradition.</p>

        <h4 id="toc9"><span>Mindless</span></h4>

        <p>Your Conjuration sphere companion is mindless; it has no Intelligence
        score (Int —) and cannot gain any (form) talents that would increase its
        Intelligence score. It gains no feats or skill points and cannot speak,
        though it is still capable of following your simple instructions. A
        mindless companion is immune to mind-affecting effects. A mindless
        companion can receive bonus feats and skill ranks to a specific skill
        from talents such as Capable Companion and Camouflaged Companion.</p>

        <p>The companion gains an additional Hit Die at 4th caster level and
        every 4 caster levels thereafter.</p>

        <h4 id="toc10"><span>Puppet</span></h4>

        <p>Your Conjuration sphere companion is incapable of action without your
        direct control. You must spend an action for your companion to take the
        same action (swift for swift, standard for standard, etc.). A puppet
        companion may make attacks of opportunity by spending your attacks of
        opportunity if you have controlled it since the beginning of your last
        turn. Spending at least a move action this way counts as concentrating
        on the summon for that round. Any round you do not spend directing the
        companion, it stands mindlessly and counts as having the dazed
        condition. Your companion may still gain feats and skills (unless also
        possessing the mindless archetype); you may use the companion’s feats,
        skills, casting, and other abilities when directing the companion,
        though you may not use your own through the companion. Any effect that
        would possess or exercise mental control over a puppet companion
        (including enchantment charm effects and enchantment compulsion effects)
        requires a successful magical skill check against the summoner’s MSD. A
        puppet companion takes a -2 penalty on all rolls if it is outside of
        your close range. If you do not have line of sight to the puppet
        companion, it is treated as being blinded. Both these penalties are
        removed if you possess the Link talent.</p>

        <p>As a standard action, you may order a puppet companion to follow.
        Doing so causes the puppet to take move actions on its turn (including
        trading its standard action for a move action) to attempt to move
        adjacent to you (or as close as it is able) to the best of its ability.
        Should the companion be unable to find you (such as in a complex maze
        when you are out of sight for too long, if you are teleported out of
        view, etc.), the companion will remain in its current position. Taking
        any other action through the companion ends this ability. The spell
        point cost of summoning a puppet companion is reduced by 1 (minimum
        0).</p>

        <h4 id="toc11"><span>Unwilling [Apoc]</span></h4>

        <p><sup><strong>Source:</strong> <a
        href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/297259/Spheres-Apocrypha-Cohorts-and-Companions?affiliate_id=549120">Spheres
        Apocrypha: Cohorts &amp; Companions</a></sup></p>

        <p>Your Conjuration sphere companion serves you unwillingly. Whenever
        you summon the companion, the first time you or it rolls for initiative
        during a combat encounter, or whenever you are engaged in an activity
        that requires a skill check and more then 1 round to accomplish (such as
        crafting items, recuperating, or researching rituals), it must attempt a
        Will saving throw against your Conjuration sphere DC. If the companion
        fails the Will save, you establish control over the companion.</p>

        <p>As long as you have control over your companion it obeys your
        commands and treats you as friendly for the purposes of the Handle
        Animal skill (if it possesses the bestial archetype). However if the
        companion succeeds on its Will save (you are not informed if it
        succeeds) the companion breaks free from your control and seeks revenge
        against you. A creature free from your control cannot be dismissed as a
        free action, and remains summoned for the remainder of its normal
        duration plus an additional minute per caster level.</p>

        <p>You may expend a spell point as a standard action to force the
        companion to attempt another Will save. If it fails the Will save, it is
        dismissed. The companion gains an additional Hit Die at 4th caster level
        and every 4 caster levels thereafter.</p>

        <p>A Conjuration sphere companion cannot possess both this archetype and
        the Puppet archetype.</p>

        <h4 id="toc12"><span>Warrior</span></h4>

        <p>This archetype may only be applied to bipedal companions. Your
        companion loses all natural attacks granted by its base form and never
        gains multiattack, but gains the benefits of the Battle Creature (form)
        talent taken twice. A companion with this archetype may never benefit
        from (form) talents that modify or grant natural attacks, though may
        still make unarmed strikes and benefit from feats and abilities that
        affect unarmed strikes as normal.</p>

        <h3 id="toc13"><span>Conjuration Talent Types</span></h3>

        <p>Some talents are marked (form). Whenever you select a (form) talent,
        apply its effects to only a single companion. You may select (form)
        talents multiple times, but no more than once per companion, unless the
        talent says otherwise.</p>

        <h3 id="toc14"><span>Type Talents</span></h3>

        <p>A (type) talent counts as a (form) talent in all ways, except that an
        individual companion may only benefit from a single talent with the
        (type) descriptor (though an individual (type) talent may still be taken
        multiple times if so noted). A (type) talent might change the
        companion’s creature type to a creature type stated in the talent,
        although it retains the (extraplanar) subtype. This does not change Hit
        Dice, skills, or grant any other benefits associated with the creature
        type in question, but the creature does count as the new type for all
        interactions such as what magic can affect it.</p>
