        <p>Heavy blows have left a creature with this condition vulnerable to
        further attacks, imposing a -2 penalty to the creatureâ€™s CMD and
        preventing them from taking attacks of opportunity provoked by a
        creature performing a combat maneuver. Some talents have different
        effects or activation times against battered creatures. The battered
        condition can be removed by taking the total defense action, or through
        the
        @UUID[Compendium.pf1spheres.magic-talents.Item.4qE54aTXuDL8MZC5]{restore}
        ability of the

        sphere}, the lesser restoration spell, or similar effects. When
        inflicting the battered condition on a target that is already battered,
        the rounds stack when determining duration.</p>
