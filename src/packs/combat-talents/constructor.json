      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (cohort) package.</p>\n<p>You may recruit cohorts with the construct type, building and animating them with the scientific application of magic. Such cohorts are built as normal cohort, but are Small or Medium creatures with the construct type and no racial abilities. Small constructs take a -2 penalty to Strength and gain a + 2 racial bonus to Dexterity. Such cohorts are mindless, gaining no skill points, and must have the warrior or woodsman profession. Mindless cohorts still gain skill ranks from spheres that grant them and may use these skills normally. Despite being constructs, these cohorts retain their Constitution score for the purpose of determining hit points and do not gain bonus hit points for size, though are still destroyed at 0 hit points. This effective Constitution may be modified by magic items that grant a continuous bonus, but not by any other effect. They do not gain feats, but may take a combat talent any time they would have gained a feat.</p>\n<p>Mindless cohorts of the construct type will obey harmful and even suicidal orders. You take no penalties to your recruit checks for the destruction of construct cohorts. When using this ability you may choose the number of Hit Dice the construct has. No Diplomacy check is required to recruit creatures in this way.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent a second time; doing so allows you to create construct cohorts with their normal Intelligence scores, gaining feats and skills normally. These cohorts may be of any profession and gain Craft and Profession as class skills.</p>\n",
