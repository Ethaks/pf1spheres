    value: >
      <p>Whenever a creature&#8217;s attempt to initiate or maintain a grapple
      or swallow whole attempt against you fails, or when you choose to release
      a grapple against an unpinned creature, you may make an attack of
      opportunity against them. Ending a grapple initiated with the grab
      universal monster ability does not grant you the same leverage as other
      uses of this ability and the attack granted for ending such a grapple must
      be taken as a swift action instead of an attack of opportunity.</p>
