    value: >
      <p>Your rapid spins and twists leave a creatures reeling. As long as you
      move no more than your base speed, when you exit a square adjacent to a
      hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Will save or be sickened
      for one round. If you move no more than half your base speed, they are
      instead nauseated for 1 round on a failed save; this talent cannot be used
      with the 5-foot step action. You may not nauseate an individual creature
      with this talent more than once per hour.</p>
