      <p>Whenever you ready a counter punch, you may spend a swift action to
      select one creature within 30 ft. of yourself; that creature must make a
      successful Will save or be shaken for 1 round. For every 5 points of base
      attack bonus you possess, the duration of this condition increase by 1
      round. You may only target an individual creature once per day with this
      talent.</p>
