      <p>You may intentionally miss with your extra attack in order to
      manipulate your opponent&#8217;s movements. Rather than make this extra
      attack, you instead may make a feint check at range against your target
      before making any other attacks as part of the barrage, including with the
      original attack action. If successful, the target loses its Dexterity
      bonus to AC against your next attack, and you may force the target to take
      a 5-foot step that does not provoke an attack of opportunity in any
      direction that does not place it in a spot that is intrinsically
      dangerous.</p>
