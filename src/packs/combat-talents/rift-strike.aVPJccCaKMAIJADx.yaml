      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere, base attack bonus
      +11.</p>

      <p>You unleash a powerful roar and swing a weapon with such extreme
      ferocity that you tear the very fabric of space and time, opening up a
      rift to another location. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of
      opportunity, you open up a rift to another location which may be as
      distant as 100 miles per point of base attack bonus you possess.
      Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as
      their weight doesn&#8217;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring
      one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or
      objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three points of base
      attack bonus you possess. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures,
      a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures
      to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of
      those creatures must be in contact with you. You must have some clear idea
      of the location and layout of the destination; if you have not been to the
      desired destination before you do not arrive at the exact location,
      instead creating a rift to a location within 1d20 miles of the desired
      point.</p>

      <p>You are exhausted for 1 hour after using this ability, and are fatigued
      as normal thereafter. You incur these penalties even if you are immune to
      the exhausted and fatigued conditions, and the exhausted condition cannot
      be removed before its duration is up. You may attempt to use this ability
      while exhausted or fatigued, but doing so incurs a 50% chance that the
      ability fails to work; regardless of whether you succeed at this attempt,
      you suffer 1d6 points of Constitution damage and the duration of the
      exhausted condition caused by using this ability is doubled. This is a
      supernatural effect.</p>
