      <p>While wielding a buckler, shield, or tower shield, you may spend a move
      action to regain your martial focus whenever you choose to fight
      defensively as part of an attack action.</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever an attack misses a creature benefiting from your
      active defense, you may regain your martial focus as an immediate
