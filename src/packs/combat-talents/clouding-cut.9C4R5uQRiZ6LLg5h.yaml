    value: >
      <p>Whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature, you may expend your
      martial focus to open a gash near the target&#8217;s sensory organ. The
      creature immediately suffers from a 10% miss chance on all of their
      attacks. At the start of their turn, when it takes damage due to their
      bleeds, it increases the miss chance bestowed by this talent by 10%. When
      the miss chance would reach 40%, the creature is instead blinded and the
      miss chance ceases to increase. Stopping the bleed damage ends this
      effect.</p>

      <p>You may use Clouding Cut against a creature already suffering from its
      effects without spending martial focus, and doing so causes their miss
      chance to increase by 10%, unless they are already blinded.</p>
