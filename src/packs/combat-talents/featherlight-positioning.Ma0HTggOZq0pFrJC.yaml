      <p>While in this stance, whenever you make an attack action, attack of
      opportunity, or additional attack granted by a class feature or talent
      with an unarmed strike, you may spend an attack of opportunity to take a
      5-foot step immediately after the attack as a free action that can be
      taken even outside of your normal turn. You may make 5-foot steps in this
      manner even if you have already moved for the round. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Circling Mongoose.</p>
