    value: >
      <p>When a creature fails its Reflex save to avoid this snare, the snare
      creates an area of difficult terrain in a 10-foot + 5 feet per 5 ranks in
      Craft (trap) radius centered on one corner of one of the squares it
      occupies, as determined when this snare is set. You can choose to create
      such an effect even without creating a trap (treating this as a trap
      that&#8217;s immediately triggered).</p>

      <p>When creating such a snare you can choose to have this area of
      difficult terrain also be filled with caltrops, pressurized spikes, or
      other such hazards. Creatures which enter or end their turn in the area
      suffer 1d6 damage +1d6 damage per 6 ranks in Craft (trap) (Reflex half).
      Creatures who remain in the area suffer damage once per round at the end
      of your subsequent turns.</p>

      <p>You and allies you warn of this trap get a +5 to Reflex saves to avoid
      its effects as normal. If you have the Aerial Trigger talent this area of
      terrain extends into the air as well, and flying creatures must still pass
      a Fly check (DC 15 + caster level) or be forced to fly at half speed while
      over the area, and must make Reflex saves to avoid taking the damage. This
      area of difficult terrain dissipates after one minute.</p>
