    value: >
      <p>When you successfully maintain a grapple against a creature you have
      already pinned, instead of one of the options normally available when you
      maintain a grapple, you may lift them over your head and smash them into
      the ground, automatically threatening a critical hit with your unarmed
      strike and rolling to confirm as normal. If the critical threat confirms
      successfully, the creature must make a successful Fortitude save or be
      staggered for 1 round. Use of this talent breaks your grapple on the
      creature. At +10 base attack bonus, the target is dazed for 1 round
      instead.</p>

      <p>This talent is not a (slam) itself, and cannot be used together with a
      (slam).</p>
