      <p>While in this stance, you are treated as though you were one size
      category larger for the purpose of calculating CMB for combat maneuvers
      attempted with unarmed strikes (including any combat maneuver made with
      your hands, such as grapples), your CMD, and your ability to use combat
      maneuvers on a creature. For every 5 base attack bonus you possess, you
      are treated as an additional size larger (if this talent would make you
      Colossal or larger, you instead receive a +1 bonus to combat maneuvers
      made with unarmed strikes and to your CMD).</p>
