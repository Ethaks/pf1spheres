    value: >
      <p>You increase the shield bonus to AC of any shield you wield by +1. When
      your base attack bonus reaches +8 you lower the armor check penalty of any
      shield you wield by 1. For every 8 points of base attack bonus you gain
      thereafter, you reduce the armor check penalty of your wielded shields by
      a further 1 (this cannot reduce your armor check penalty below 0).
