    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully attack with your counter punch, you may force
      the creature to succeed at a Fortitude save or be unable to make attacks
      of opportunities for 1 round, and have all the air forced from their
      lungs, reducing the amount of time they can hold their breath to 1 round,
      for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1
      round). This effect can be ended early by using the Restore Capacity
      function of the Life sphere.</p>
