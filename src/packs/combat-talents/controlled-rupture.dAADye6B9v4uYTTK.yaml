      <p>Whenever you throw a splash weapon, you can select a number of squares
      equal to your practitioner modifier that are not affected by the splash
      damage from it. If the splash weapon misses, this talent has no
      effect.</p>

      <p><strong>Addendum [Apoc]:</strong> You can take this talent a second
      time. If you do, the selected squares are not affected by any effects of
      the thrown splash weapon.</p>
