      <p>You may perform the charge and withdraw actions while swimming, and can
      make standard actions and attack actions without decreasing the duration
      for which you can hold your breath. A successful Swim check means you may
      move up to your base land speed as a full-round action (as opposed to 1/2
      your base land speed) or 1/2 your base land speed as a move action (as
      opposed to 1/4th your base land speed). <strong>Associated Movement
      Mode:</strong> Swimming. <strong>Associated Skill:</strong> Swim.</p>
