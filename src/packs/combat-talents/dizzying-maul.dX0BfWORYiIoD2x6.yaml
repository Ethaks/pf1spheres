      <p>Whenever you successfully attack with your counter punch, you throw the
      target off balance. If the target attempts to move greater than half its
      speed during its next turn, the target must succeed at an Acrobatics check
      with a DC equal to your Boxing sphere DC or fall prone.</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain the following new trigger to choose from when you
      ready a counter punch:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>A hostile creature falls prone</li>

      </ul>
