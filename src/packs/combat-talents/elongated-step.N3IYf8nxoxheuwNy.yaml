      <p>At the start of your turn, you can spend a swift action to use this
      talent. When you do, until the beginning of your next turn whenever you
      use your counter punch ability, you increase your reach by 5 feet for
      attacks made with your counter punch. At +10 base attack bonus, you
      instead increase your reach by 10 feet. If you expend your martial focus
      while activating this talent, it instead lasts a number of rounds equal to
      your practitioner modifier.</p>
