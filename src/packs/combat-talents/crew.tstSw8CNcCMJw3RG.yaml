      <p>Your followers are experienced at handling various tasks onboard large
      craft. Your caravan counts as one small crew with a level equal to your
      ranks in Diplomacy - 2 (minimum 1, but if you have less than 2 ranks in
      Diplomacy, reduce the crew&#8217;s hit points by 20 and damage by 2d6 and
      if you have exactly 2 ranks in Diplomacy, reduce hit points by 10 and
      damage by 1d6). For every five ranks of Diplomacy you possess, the caravan
      may count as an additional small crew. A crew formed from your followers
      gains a +10 morale bonus on loyalty checks and their loyalty is not
      reduced by not paying them. Each crew gains one bonus perk, plus one
      additional perk for every five ranks of Diplomacy you possess. These perks
      may be changed with 1d4 days of training and recruiting.</p>

      <p>(See Players Guide to Skybourne and Ships of Skybourne for crew
      rules.)</p>
