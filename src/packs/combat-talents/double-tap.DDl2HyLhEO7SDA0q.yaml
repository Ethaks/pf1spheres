    value: >
      <p>You fire an additional piece of ammunition, striking the target twice
      as hard where they've already been damaged. When a target is struck by an
      additional attack modified by this (blitz), the target also takes an
      additional +1 precision damage for each attack that previously damaged
      that target as part of this barrage. This additional damage increases by
      +1 for every 7 base attack bonus you possess. A character with 14 BAB
      would deal +3 damage on the second successful attack, then +6, +9, and so
      on.</p>

      <p>You expend an additional piece of ammunition when using this
      (blitz).</p>
