      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Handle Animal 5 ranks, Beastmastery
      sphere ((handle animal) package).</p>

      <p>You may expend martial focus as a standard action to force a creature
      to which you can tame within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 ranks in
      Handle Animal) to succeed at a Will save or have its attitude improved to
      helpful and serve you as a tame creature for 1 minute per rank in Handle
      Animal you possess. Creatures that do not have the animal type gain a +2
      bonus on their Will save against this effect. A creature that successfully
      saves against this talent is immune to the same practitioner&#8217;s
      attempts for 24 hours. When the duration of the tame effect ends, the
      creature returns to its previous disposition, modified by any other
      effects that would have altered it while tamed. Attempting to make the
      creature perform an obviously suicidal action ends the tame.</p>
