      <p>You can draw a weapon as part of the action used to make an attack with
      it. This can be used with splash weapons, but not with other items such as
      potions, scrolls, or wands. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight
      of Hand skill) as a move action. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Quick
