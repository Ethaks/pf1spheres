      <p>Your followers can disperse into a settlement, talking, listening, and
      influencing. Your followers can perform the following actions:</p>

      <p><strong>Gather Crowd:</strong> Your followers can spend 1d4 hours
      gathering a crowd. Make a Diplomacy skill check; the number of intelligent
      creatures in the crowd is equal to 10 times the result of the check. This
      multiplier increases by 10 at 5 ranks of Diplomacy and again every 5 ranks
      after (so times 20 at 5 ranks, times 30 and 10 ranks, etc.).</p>

      <p><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Your followers spend 1d4 hours
      making a Gather Information check, using your modifiers. They may make an
      additional check simultaneously for every 5 ranks in Diplomacy you
      possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Influence Crowd:</strong> Your followers encourage a crowd to
      be swayed by your words. When you make a skill check to influence a crowd,
      you automatically gain a +2 bonus from your follower&#8217;s use of the
      aid another action. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in
      Diplomacy that you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Publicity:</strong> Your followers may spread good words about
      you, making a settlement more positively disposed toward you and your
      allies. The disposition of the average member of the settlement toward you
      increases by one step, to a maximum of friendly. This requires 1 day for a
      settlement of village size; double the time required for every size larger
      than village. For every 5 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess, the number
      of days required is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1 day.</p>

      <p><strong>Whispers:</strong> If using the Rumors<sup>UI</sup> rules, you
      may have your followers participate in spreading a rumor, reducing the
      time required to start a rumor by 1 day, plus 1 day per 4 ranks in
      Diplomacy (to a minimum of 1 day). You automatically gain a +2 bonus from
      your follower&#8217;s use of the aid another action for all checks to
      start, spread, influence, or squash a rumor in a settlement where they are
      present.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if you possess the (cohort) package, your followers may
      aid in recruitment, reducing the time required to recruit a cohort to 1d4
      hours, -1 hour for every 6 ranks of Diplomacy you possess (minimum 1 hour
      required).</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers
      reduce the influence cost of promoting your business or recruiting for an
      organization in a settlement that they are present in by 1, +1 per 4 ranks
      in Diplomacy.</p>
