    value: >
      <p>Whenever you are within melee range of a battered creature, you can
      make a single roll as a standard action; this roll is treated both as an
      Acrobatics check to jump vertically or horizontally (being treated as
      though you had a running start) and an attack action against that creature
      which must be made with an unarmed strike. Any movement from this talent
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature.</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, if you end the movement from this talent
      within melee range of another creature, you may use it again as a move
      action, but the attack granted from this talent is not treated as an
      attack action.</p>
