      "value": "<p>Your followers include actors, musicians, and other performers, and they possess props, backdrops, and the other accoutrements required for a dazzling performance.</p>\n<p>Any Perform checks made while with the followers automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus from being well equipped and +2 circumstance bonus from the performers&#8217; aid. The bonus from the performer&#8217;s aid increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess. You may choose to have the DC of Knowledge checks regarding you to have their DC increase or decrease by up to 5. Changing this decision results in the DC increasing or decreasing by 1 per week until the new DC is reached. This DC change increases to 10 at 7 ranks in Diplomacy and 15 at 14 ranks.</p>\n<p>While in a settlement, your followers can always gain access to a theater, stage, or hall if one is present. You caravan has a portable stage for performances on the road. Additionally, when in a settlement, your followers collectively make Perform checks using your Diplomacy modifier, earning you the check result in gold pieces each week. This stacks with earnings from other talents.</p>\n<p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may generate Influence capital in place of earning gold, with 15 gp equaling 1 Influence. This stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>\n<p>If using the reputation and fame rules from Ultimate Campaign, any time your followers are in a settlement for at least 1 day, that settlement is considered to be in your Sphere of Influence. Additionally, your followers can suppress negative talk about you, reducing the total penalties to your reputation by your Diplomacy modifier. Any infamous deeds are still known, but they are viewed in the most sympathetic light. Additionally, you gain +1 prestige point every character level.</p>\n",
