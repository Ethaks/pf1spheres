      Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering),
      Knowledge (planes), Use Magic Device</p>

      <p>All professions gain the following starting equipment: Any focus or
      spell components pouch required by casting tradition, a simple melee or
      ranged weapon with 20 pieces ammunition (Combined value less than 100 gp
      total)</p>

      <p>These professions gain a casting tradition in place of their martial
      tradition and have the casting class feature, gaining the 2 bonus talents
      and caster levels equal to 1/2 of their Hit Dice. They gain a spell pool
      equal to their Hit Dice plus their casting ability modifier, with
      additional from their tradition if applicable. They gain magic talents in
      place of combat talents from their Hit Dice. Their base attack bonus is
      reduced to be equal to half their Hit Dice.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Squad talent, you may form a troop, using 1d4 troop
      damage and the following abilities based on feats and spheres
      possessed:</p>

      <p><strong>Channel (requires Spell Attack feat<sup>CotS</sup>):</strong>
      May add the effect of one sphere effect the cohort possesses that is
      compatible with Spell Attack to one creature that takes swarm damage. This
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p><strong>Healing (requires cure):</strong> May spend a spell point as a
      swift action to grant itself fast healing equal to its Hit Dice for 1
      minute. This reflects a few members of the troop healing others without
      otherwise interrupting combat activities.</p>

      <p><strong>Spell Bombardment (requires destructive blast):</strong> May
      deal troop damage using 1d6 damage dice to a 10 foot radius + 5 feet per 5
      ranks in Diplomacy within destructive blast range, modifying the damage
      die and applying the additional effects of one (blast type) talent the
      troop possesses.</p>
