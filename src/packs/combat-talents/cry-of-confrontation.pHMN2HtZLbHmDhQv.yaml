      <p>You may expend your martial focus to use this shout and cause all enemy
      creatures who fail their Will save against this shout to take a -1 penalty
      on all attack rolls that do not include you as a target. Creatures
      incapable of targeting you with their attacks (for example, if you are
      flying out of reach of an enemy whose only available weapons are melee
      attacks) ignore this penalty. For every 4 ranks in Diplomacy you possess,
      this penalty increases by -1.</p>
