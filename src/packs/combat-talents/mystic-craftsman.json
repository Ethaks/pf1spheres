      "value": "<p>Your followers may craft magic items using your skill ranks, feats, and other abilities, even in your absence, allowing 8 hours of progress to be made each day in addition to any time spent by you or your allies. This does not increase the number of magic items that may be crafted at one time nor in one day. An allied PC may share his skills, feats, and abilities in place of yours, but all checks to craft the item take a -2 penalty.</p>\n<p>Any allied PC crafting a magic item automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks made as part of the crafting from the crafters&#8217; aid. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess. If you possess the Merchant&#8217;s talent, treat your followers&#8217; base value as one step higher (if you have 18 ranks or more in Diplomacy, double the base value).</p>\n<p>If you possess the (cohort) package, your cohort&#8217;s starting weapons count as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. If you also possess the Craftsmen talent, the cohort&#8217;s starting weapons and armor become +1 at 7 ranks in Diplomacy and +2 at 14 ranks in Diplomacy. This does not affect any additional weapons and armor you give them.</p>\n<p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may generate Magic capital in place of earning gold, with 50 gp equaling 1 Magic. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>\n",
