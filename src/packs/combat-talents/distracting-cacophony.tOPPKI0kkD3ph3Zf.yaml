      <p>Your disorienting screech echoes in the back of the minds of your foes.
      When you use this shout, all hostile creatures within its radius must
      succeed on a Will save. All creatures who fail their save against this
      shout increase the DC of all concentration checks and Intelligence-based
      skill checks by +2, increasing by +1 for every 4 ranks in Diplomacy you
      possess. This increase to concentration check DCs does not stack with the
      Disruptive feat or other effects which increase the DCs of concentration
      checks. In addition, creatures who take damage while affected by this
      shout suffer 5% spell failure during their next turn, increasing by 5% for
      every 4 ranks of Diplomacy you possess. If a creature is suffering spell
      failure chance from another source (such as spell failure from the Somatic
      Casting general drawback), add this spell failure to the other source to
      get a single spell failure source. This spell failure applies to all
      spells, spell-like, supernatural, and spherecasting abilities that the
      creature possesses. A creature who fails their save against this shout can
      attempt a new save each round as a free action at the end of their
      turn.</p>
