      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere.</p>

      <p>When running, you move ten times your normal speed (if wearing medium,
      light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or 8 times
      your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make
      a jump after a running start you gain a +8 bonus on your Acrobatics
      check.</p>

      <p>You may expend your focus as a swift action to increase your base speed
      by 50 ft. for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier. This
      increase is not limited to only land speed. After these rounds end, you
      are fatigued for 1d4 rounds. You are fatigued even if you are usually
      immune to the fatigued condition. You cannot use this ability if you are
      fatigued or exhausted.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Strong Lungs talent, you can replace its usual bonus
      to rounds you may run to instead be able to run for a number of hours
      equal to your Constitution modifier.</p>
