      <p>You can spur and encourage your mount to fight more ferociously. While
      mounted, as a free action at the start of each turn, you can choose to
      take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to grant
      your mount a +1 competence bonus on all attack rolls with natural weapons.
      This penalty and the bonus granted to your mount end at the start of your
      next turn. For every 4 ranks of Ride you possess, the penalty you take and
      the bonus granted to your mount increase by 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Saddle Shrieker.</p>
