    value: >
      <p>On a successful deadly shot against an object, you can attempt a
      Disable Device check substituting your attack roll for the results,
      although you deal damage equal to your weapon&#8217;s damage die to the
      object being disabled (this can be used with traps, but takes a -5
      penalty). You can also use this check to instead activate a trap upon
      making a successful Disable Device check. You can also jam a lock with
      this talent, requiring a Disable Device check equal to your attack roll to
      open it.</p>
