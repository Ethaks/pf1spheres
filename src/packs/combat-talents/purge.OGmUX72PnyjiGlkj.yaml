      <p>As a move action, you can cause yourself to throw up, granting yourself
      a new save against any ingested poison from which you are currently
      suffering with a circumstance bonus to your Fortitude save equal to your
      practitioner modifier. In addition, select one adjacent square to
      yourself, causing it to be treated as difficult terrain for 1 minute. If a
      creature enters that square, it must make a Reflex saving throw or fall
      prone. For every 5 points of base attack bonus you possess, you can select
      an additional adjacent square to be treated as difficult terrain. Clearing
      a square of difficult terrain is a standard action.</p>
