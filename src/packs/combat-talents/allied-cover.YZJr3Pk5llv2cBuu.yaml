      <p>When you are within your cohort&#8217;s threatened area, you gain a 20%
      miss chance against attacks the cohort is aware of. The benefits from
      multiple cohorts do not stack.</p>

      <p>When you are targeted by an attack or single-target effect and are
      within the threatened area of a cohort, you may expend martial focus to
      redirect the attack or effect to the cohort as a joint immediate
