    value: >
      <p>When any allied creature is with your followers, the allied creature
      counts as having access to an alchemy lab. The followers can craft
      alchemical items with a DC of not greater than 15 + your ranks in
      Diplomacy, requiring that you pay the normal crafting cost. The followers
      makes 10 gp of progress per rank in Diplomacy per day and can craft
      masterwork items.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if a PC is crafting formulae from the Alchemy sphere, the
      followers can assist them, allowing them to craft one additional item per
      rank in Diplomacy in the 15 minute crafting time. This additional
      productivity may be divided among present PCs who are crafting at the same
      time.</p>

      <p>Alchemists can identify alchemical items and potions with a Craft
      (alchemy) check of 15 + your ranks in Diplomacy.</p>

      <p>Any Craft (alchemy) checks made while with the followers automatically
      gain a +2 circumstance bonus from the alchemists&#8217; aid. This bonus
      increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Merchants talent, alchemical items purchased from
      the followers have their cost reduced by half.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Magic capital in place of earning gold, with 50 gp equaling 1
      Magic. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This
      stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>
