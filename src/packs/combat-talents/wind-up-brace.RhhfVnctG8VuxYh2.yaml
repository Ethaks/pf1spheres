    value: >
      <p>As long as you move no more than half your base speed, when you succeed
      at an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from an
      opponent when you move through its threatened area or its space, any
      damage the next attack that creature makes against you until the beginning
      of your next turn deals nonlethal damage. If you are damaged by the
      attack, you may immediately spend an attack of opportunity to move 5 feet
      without provoking an attack of opportunity using a movement mode
      associated with any Athletics package you possess. This talent cannot be
      used with the 5-foot step action, and you do not convert lethal damage to
      nonlethal damage with this talent if you are immune to nonlethal
      damage.</p>

      <p>For every 6 ranks in a skill granted by an Athletics package you
      possess, you may move an additional 5 feet when spending an attack of
      opportunity to move with this talent.</p>
