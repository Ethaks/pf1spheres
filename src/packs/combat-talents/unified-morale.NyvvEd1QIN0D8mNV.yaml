      <p>Allies who are benefiting from a spell or effect that grants a morale
      bonus on a particular type of roll may also grant that morale bonus with
      other allies within range of this tactic. Once during that effect&#8217;s
      duration, each ally can apply that morale bonus on a roll they attempt of
      that type. For instance, if an ally benefiting from this tactic is also
      benefiting from heroism, once during the duration of the spell another
      ally could gain a +2 morale bonus on one saving throw, attack roll, or
      skill check. An individual ally can borrow someone&#8217;s morale bonus
      once per round, and only once per spell or effect. Changing in and out of
      this tactic does not allow for a bonus from the same spell or effect to be
      used additional times.</p>
