      <p>You may ready an action to move up to your speed using a movement mode
      corresponding to a package you possess as a move action. If used to avoid
      an attack or area effect, this movement grants you evasion and a dodge
      bonus to AC and Reflex saves equal to half your ranks in the skill
      associated with the movement type you use to perform the move action
      (minimum 1). Creatures that already have evasion instead gain improved
      evasion. You may expend focus to instead ready the move action as a swift
      action, but doing so makes you staggered on your next turn even if you
      would normally be immune to the staggered condition. This ability does not
      allow you to maintain multiple readied actions at the same time. This
      readied action does not change your initiative count. For every 4 ranks in
      a skill associated with a movement type, you may assign an additional
      trigger to your readied action.</p>
