      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Berserker sphere.</p>

      <p>You are not subject to fatigue or exhaustion that is the result of
      taking damage from environmental heat. In addition, while berserking or
      using the rage class feature, your body puts off an aura of heat affecting
      all creatures and objects within reach (including yourself). Each round
      that you continue berserking or raging, the heat severity level in the
      affected area increases by 1 step (maximum heat severity 4 + 1 step per 7
      points of base attack bonus). Any round that you are not berserking or
      raging, the heat severity level in the affected area decreases by 1 step,
      until it has reached normal heat levels. For the purpose of control
      weather, you are considered to have a magic skill bonus equal to your base
      attack bonus.</p>
