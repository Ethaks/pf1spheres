      <p>Whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature, you may cause them to
      take a penalty on all weapon attack rolls equal to the amount of bonus
      bleed damage granted to you by blooded strike for as long as the bleed is
      in effect. Any healing or other ability that ends the bleed also ends this
      penalty.</p>
