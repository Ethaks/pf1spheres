      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Athletics sphere.</p>\n<p>Whenever you move at least 30 feet, you may whip up a gust of wind. This wind affects every square adjacent to you during this movement and triggers at the end of your movement. Creatures in affected squares that are at least 2 sizes smaller than you must succeed at a Reflex save or have their movement speed reduced by half for one round. Creatures in affected squares that are at least 3 sizes smaller than you automatically have their movement speed reduced by half for one round and must succeed at a Reflex save or be pushed 5 feet and knocked prone. Creatures are pushed in a direction relative to your movement when you were adjacent to them, and do not provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement.</p>\n<p>For every 5 ranks in a skill associated with your current movement mode you possess, creatures are pushed 5 feet farther and you treat creatures as being 1 size smaller than they actually are for the purpose of being affected by Windwake.</p>\n",
