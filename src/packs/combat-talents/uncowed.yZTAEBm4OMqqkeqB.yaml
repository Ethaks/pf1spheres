      <p>You gain a morale bonus equal to 1/2 your ranks in Intimidate to the DC
      of any check to demoralize you (minimum 1) and gain a +1 morale bonus on
      all saves against fear effects. For every 5 points of base attack bonus
      you possess, the bonus on saves against fear effects increases by +1.</p>

      <p>When a creature attempts to Intimidate you and fails, or when you
      succeed on a save against a fear effect, you may expend martial focus to
      make a demoralization check against the creature who initiated the
      effect.</p>
