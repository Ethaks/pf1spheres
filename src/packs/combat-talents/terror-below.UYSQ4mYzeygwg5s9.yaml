    value: >
      <p>While beneath the surface of water or another liquid, as an attack
      action, you can move through the water up to 1/4 your base land speed or
      1/2 your swim speed if you possess one and make a melee attack against a
      creature above the surface of the water. If you do, that creature must
      succeed at a Reflex saving throw or fall into the water in a square of
      your choice adjacent to you (even if they are standing on solid ground).
      If you have 10 or more ranks in Swim, when a creature is forced into water
      by this attack, they are unable to hold their breath beforehand, and must
      instantly start attempting checks upon the beginning of their round to
      avoid drowning.</p>
