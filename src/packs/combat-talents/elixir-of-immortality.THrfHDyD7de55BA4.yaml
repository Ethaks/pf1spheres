      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere, Craft (alchemy) 12
      ranks.</p>

      <p>You may create a special elixir that restores a creature to its
      starting age as a young adult. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and
      Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are
      removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result
      from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle
      age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time).
      Unlike a standard formulae, it takes 1 month to brew an elixir of
      immortality, and it costs an additional 50,000 gp in materials to
      create.</p>
