      <p>As a move action, you may issue a challenge to a creature you can see.
      You may expend martial focus to reduce this to a swift action. A creature
      must be able to perceive your challenge to be affected by it. The creature
      takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls that do not include you as a target and
      a +2 bonus on attack rolls targeting only you. Creatures receiving this
      effect are aware of it, though do not gain insight to its duration. This
      penalty (but not bonus) increases by 1 for every 4 points of base attack
      bonus you possess. The challenge lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 +
      1/2 your base attack bonus. When you issue a new challenge, any previous
      challenge you have active ends. Multiple challenges do not stack; if a
      creature is affected by challenges from more than one creature, they
      suffer no penalty against the source of any challenge against them and
      likewise gain the bonus against the sources of all of the challenges.
      Creatures with no Intelligence score (Intelligence score of (-)) cannot be
      targeted by your challenge.</p>

      <h2 id="toc1"><span><span style="color: #993300">Patrol</span></span></h2>

      <p>As long as you have martial focus, as a full-round action you may
      increase your threatened area by 5 ft., +5 ft. for every 4 points of base
      attack bonus you possess. This increased threatened area is applied after
      the effects of the reach weapon special feature. Until the beginning of
      your next turn, you may make attacks of opportunity against any creature
      in this threatened area that provokes attacks of opportunity. You may move
      to bring the creature that provokes the attack of opportunity within your
      reach as part of these attacks, provided your total movement before your
      next turn does not exceed your base speed. Any movement you make provokes
      attacks of opportunity as normal. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Combat
      Patrol.</p>

      <p>Talents with the (zone) tag grant additional effects to this ability.
      Each patrol may only benefit from one (zone) talent.</p>
