    value: >
      <p>If you successfully trip a creature and deal damage to that same
      creature using an unarmed strike during the same round, that creature
      gains the battered condition until the end of your next turn. That
      creature's movement speed is reduced by 10 feet for as long as the target
      has the battered condition. This effect cannot reduce a creature&#8217;s
      movement speed below 5 feet. At +10 base attack bonus, the movement speed
      reduction increases to 15 feet.</p>
