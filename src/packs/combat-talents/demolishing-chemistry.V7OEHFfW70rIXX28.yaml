      <p>Alchemical formulae that would only deal half damage to objects due to
      dealing energy damage or being ranged attacks instead deal full damage,
      and deal an additional 2 damage per rank in Craft (alchemy) to unattended
      objects.</p>

      <p>If the formulae destroys a wall or piece of terrain, it can affect
      creatures or objects on the other side, although damage dealt to the
      barrier is subtracted from any damage done to the creatures or
      objects.</p>
