    value: >
      <p>Any creature serving as your mount counts as tame and an animal ally
      and as having been combat trained per the Handle Animal skill. This does
      not allow you to handle or push a creature of greater than animal
      Intelligence (Intelligence 3 or higher), but does allow them to benefit
      from some talents, such as Lookout or Pack Attack, though not from any
      that grant additional tricks, purposes, or Hit Dice. The creature no
      longer counts as tame or an animal ally once you dismount. Additionally,
      you may add half your base attack bonus (minimum +1) as a competence bonus
      on all checks to stay mounted and never fall off your mount when you
      become unconscious unless you choose to at the time you fall unconscious.
      You never take a penalty on ride checks for lacking a saddle, bit, or
      bridle.</p>
