      <p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever you would bull rush, drag,
      or reposition a creature into a space occupied by a wall, creature, or
      object no more than one size smaller than the creature, the target of the
      maneuver stops its movement in the adjacent space and both the creature
      and the wall, other creature, or object suffer bludgeoning damage. The
      amount of damage dealt is determined by the size of the creature being
      bull rushed, dragged, or repositioned, as indicated on the list below:
      <strong>Fine</strong> 1d2, <strong>Diminutive</strong> 1d3,
      <strong>Tiny</strong> 1d4, <strong>Small</strong> 1d6,
      <strong>Medium</strong> 1d8, <strong>Large</strong> 1d10,
      <strong>Huge</strong> 2d6, <strong>Gargantuan</strong> 2d8,
      <strong>Colossal</strong> 3d6. This damage is increased by the listed
      amount again for every 5-ft. square the creature would have traveled
      beyond the wall, other creature, or object.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a second time. If you do, you no longer
      require martial focus to apply its effects. In addition, all creatures are
      considered to be two sizes larger for the purpose of determining damage
      dealt by this talent, to a maximum of Colossal. [Alienist HB]</p>
