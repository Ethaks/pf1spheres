      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere (Mobile Striker),
      Guardian sphere (Sweeping Defense), base attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>When you use Mobile Striker and Sweeping Defense in the same round,
      instead of attacking multiple adjacent targets, you may instead target
      multiple creatures you threaten with the weapon used for the attack at
      some point during your movement. Resolve the attack action after
      completing the movement from Mobile Striker. At base attack bonus +15, you
      may instead target any number of creatures threatened during movement.</p>
