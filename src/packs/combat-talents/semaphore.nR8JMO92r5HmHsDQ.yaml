      <p>You may use a shout with a visual component, using a form of
      choreography or signaling devices (such as dance or flags) as the medium
      for your shouts; this allows creatures who are deaf, but not blind, to be
      affected by your shouts. In addition, when adding such a visual component,
      the normal radius of effect of the shout increases by 15 feet.</p>
