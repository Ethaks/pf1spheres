      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks, Perception
      6 ranks, Scout sphere (Heightened Awareness, Magehunter&#8217;s
      Vision).</p>

      <p>After spending three rounds using Heightened Awareness to examine a
      magic aura, you may track the creature or object that created the magic
      aura. You gain a circumstance bonus to follow tracks based upon the
      strength of the examined aura (dim +1, faint +2, moderate +4, strong +8,
      overwhelming +16). The bonus lasts until you have traveled a number of
      miles or made a number of Survival checks equal to half your ranks in
      Perception, or until you use Heightened Awareness to examine another magic
      aura.</p>
