      <p>You can use the hand wielding a light shield to also wield a light or
      one-handed weapon, as if it were a buckler, but you take a -2 penalty on
      attack rolls (instead of -1). If the hand wielding the light shield is
      wielding a weapon from the close or light blades fighter weapon group, you
      only take a -1 penalty on attack rolls. Whenever you would attempt a melee
      attack with a shield bash, you may instead attempt a melee attack with a
      light or one-handed weapon from the close or light blades fighter weapon
      groups wielded in your shield hand.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a total of twice. If taken a second time,
      whenever you would attempt a melee attack with a shield bash, you may
      instead attempt a melee attack with any light or one-handed weapon (not
      just those from the close or light blades fighter weapon groups) wielded
      in your shield hand.</p>
