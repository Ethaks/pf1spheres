The only exception to this is special attack actions, such as brutal strikes, barrages, and deadly shots, which are not applied to the off-hand weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This talent is designed to make it viable to use different types of weapons when dual wielding, rather than two copies of the same weapon. It does not allow additional actions, allow you to vital strike with both weapons, etc.</p>\n",
