You may use a Perception check to detect sensors (such as from the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell) as if they were invisible creatures with a Stealth check of 20 + the caster level of the effect. As long as you have martial focus, you also immediately become aware of any attempt to scry on you, such as with a divination (scrying) school spell or the Scrying advanced divination talent. If these spells and effects originate within 30 ft. of you, you also know their location. As soon as you become aware of such an effect, you may force the caster to make a caster level check opposed by your Stealth check. If you succeed, the effect becomes unable to detect any information about yourself or the area or creatures within 30 ft. of you.</p>\n",
