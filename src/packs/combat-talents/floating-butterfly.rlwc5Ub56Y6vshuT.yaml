      <p>While in this stance, whenever you ready a counter punch, you may
      choose to forgo the competence bonus to your counter punch&#8217;s damage
      roll in order to gain a dodge bonus to AC equal to half the bonus damage
      until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, whenever you are
      targeted with a melee attack while benefiting from this dodge bonus, you
      may expend an attack of opportunity to make a 5-foot step immediately
      after the attack resolves.</p>
