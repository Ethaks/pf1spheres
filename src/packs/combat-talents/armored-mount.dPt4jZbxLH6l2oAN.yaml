      <p>Any creature you are mounted on gains a competence bonus to armor class
      and combat maneuver defense equal to 1/2 your ranks in Ride (rounded down,
      minimum +1). In addition, your mount gains a pool of temporary hit points
      that regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute up to a maximum amount equal to
      your ranks in Ride; your mount starts at 1 temporary hit point when you
      mount and these hit points disappear immediately if you begin your turn
      not mounted on that creature.</p>
