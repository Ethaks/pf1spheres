      <p>(This talent utilizes the Tech sphere from The Inventor&#8217;s
      Handbook.)</p>

      <p>When any allied creature is with your followers, the allied creature
      counts as having access to an engineering kit.</p>

      <p>The followers can craft technological items with a DC of not greater
      than 15 + your ranks in Diplomacy, requiring that you pay the normal
      crafting cost. The followers makes 10 gp of progress per rank in Diplomacy
      per day and can craft masterwork items.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if a PC is charging gadgets from the Tech sphere, the
      followers can assist them, allowing them to add one additional charge per
      rank in Diplomacy in the 15 minute crafting time. This additional
      productivity may be divided among present PCs who are crafting at the same
      time.</p>

      <p>Artificers can identify gadgets and technological items with a Craft
      (mechanical) check of 15 + your ranks in Diplomacy.</p>

      <p>Any Craft (mechanical) checks made while with the followers
      automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus from the artificers&#8217; aid.
      This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you
      possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Merchants talent, technological items purchased from
      the followers have their cost reduced by half.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Goods capital in place of earning gold, with 10 gp equaling 1
      Good. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This
      stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>
