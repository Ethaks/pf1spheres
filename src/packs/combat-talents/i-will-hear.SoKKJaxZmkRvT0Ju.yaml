      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Guardian sphere, Defend Other.</p>

      <p>You may form a bond with a creature as a full-round action. A bonded
      creature can call your name as an immediate action; if you are within 1
      mile per base attack bonus, you become immediately aware of the call and
      the direction to the creature. At +5 base attack bonus, this range
      increases to 10 miles per base attack bonus. At +10 base attack bonus, the
      range becomes unlimited as long as you are both on the same plane. At +15
      base attack bonus, you may hear the call across the planes and gain
      knowledge of what plane the calling creature is on. You may maintain a
      number of these bonds equal to your base attack bonus.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> To form a bond, a creature must be
      within your reach + 5 ft. + 5 ft. for every 4 points of base attack bonus
      you possess.</p>
