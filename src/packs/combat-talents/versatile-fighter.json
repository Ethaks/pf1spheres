Additionally, when you successfully damage a creature with an attack action modified by Combat Expertise, increase the dodge bonus to armor class granted by Combat Expertise by 1, +1 per 10 base attack bonus you possess, until the end of your next turn. This increase does not stack with itself. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Combat Expertise.</li>\n<li><strong>Recovery Style:</strong> While in this stance, you gain the benefit of the Heroic Resolve feat. Additionally, when you successfully damage a creature with an attack action while in this stance, your next activation of Heroic Resolve until the end of your next turn does not require expenditure of your martial focus. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Heroic Resolve.</li>\n</ul>\n",
