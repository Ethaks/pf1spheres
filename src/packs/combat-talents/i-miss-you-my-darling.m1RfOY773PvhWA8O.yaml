      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Stealth ranks 10, Scout sphere (Track
      The Scene), Sniper sphere.</p>

      <p>Whenever you miss your target when performing a deadly shot, you may
      expend martial focus as a free action. If you do, you designate that
      target as your prey. While following the tracks of your prey, you may take
      10 on Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty.
      In addition, you receive a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against
      your prey, and automatically confirm the first critical threat you make
      against your prey. This effect ends when you confirm a critical threat
      against your prey, or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first. A creature
      cannot be designated as your prey more than once every 24 hours.</p>

      <p>You may not have more than one creature designated as your prey at any
      time, and may dismiss this effect at any time as a free action.</p>
