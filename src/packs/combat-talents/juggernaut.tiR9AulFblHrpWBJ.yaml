      <p>You barrel across the cluttered battlefield more easily than others.
      You ignore difficult terrain when you charge, run, or withdraw. You can
      also charge through squares that contain allies. When using the charge
      action, you do not take a penalty to your AC and increase the bonus on
      attack rolls and bull rush combat maneuvers at the end of a charge by 1,
      increasing by +1 for every 10 base attack bonus you possess.</p>
