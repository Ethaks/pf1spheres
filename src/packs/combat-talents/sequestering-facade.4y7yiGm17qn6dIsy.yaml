      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bluff 10 ranks, Fencing sphere (Expert
      Feint, Master Of Deception), base attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>You can bend reality with your deceptions. When you successfully feint
      a hostile creature using Master Of Deception, you may have the creature
      become sequestered for 1 round instead of being confused. If you feint
      multiple creatures, choose a single feinted creature to sequester.</p>

      <p>While sequestered, the feinted creature can only see you, as their
      reality becomes warped and shifted to believing you and themselves are the
      only creatures to exist. During this time, the target cannot be interacted
      with in any way by other creatures, (except you) and vice versa.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, when you successfully sequester a creature using this
      talent, you may enter a stance, allowing the creature to remain
      sequestered for as long as you remain within the stance. The creature may
      attempt a Will saving throw at the end of each of their turns as a free
      action to no longer be sequestered, ending the stance and its effects on a
      successful save.</p>

      <p>This is a supernatural mind-affecting effect.</p>
