      <p>You can wield a quarterstaff as a one-handed weapon or as a reach
      weapon. At the start of your turn, you decide whether or not you are going
      to wield the quarterstaff as a one-handed weapon, two-handed weapon,
      double weapon, or two-handed reach weapon. When you wield it as a
      one-handed weapon, your other hand is free. You cannot use a staff as a
      double weapon if you are wielding it as a reach weapon or a one-handed
      weapon. In your hands, a quarterstaff is treated as a trip weapon.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Spear Dancer talent as well, a quarterstaff is
      treated as a finesse weapon in your hand, and you may wield a quarterstaff
      as a one-handed reach weapon. Additionally, spears and polearms gain the
      trip weapon special feature in your hands. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Quarterstaff Master.</p>
