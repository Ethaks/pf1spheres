    value: >
      <p>You may ignore the attack penalty for attacking while carrying a tower
      shield. You can also bash with a tower shield, dealing 1d8 bludgeoning
      damage with it (1d6 Small). You and others modifying or enchanting a
      shield you possess may treat tower shields as heavy shields for the
      purposes of enchantments (such as bashing) and shield spikes.
      Additionally, any tower shield you are wielding has its maximum Dexterity
      bonus increased by 1 and its armor check penalty reduced by 1, +1 for
      every 5 base attack bonus you possess.</p>
