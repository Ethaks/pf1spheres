    value: >
      <p>You gain a familiar as the wizard class feature with an effective
      arcane spellcaster level equal to the highest between your base attack
      bonus or your ranks in Handle Animal. A familiar chosen with this talent
      must have the animal type and retains the animal type rather than becoming
      a magical beast, and does not gain an Intelligence bonus or the deliver
      touch spells, scry on familiar, share spells, speak with animals of its
      kind, or spell resistance special abilities. This familiar always counts
      as an animal ally.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Broad Skills talent, you may instead choose any
      familiar ordinarily available from the wizard class feature (such as
      familiar options with the construct, plant, or vermin type).</p>

      <p>If this familiar is dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week
      later at no cost.</p>

      <p>Abilities that grant talents temporarily can not be used to gain this
      talent, such as taking the Extra Combat Talent feat with martial
      flexibility or gaining it from an armiger&#8217;s customized weapon.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Familiar Bond.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you already possess a familiar, or gain
      one at a later time from another source, you may choose to have your
      effective arcane caster level from this talent stack with those from other
      sources, to a maximum of your character level. If you do, you may choose
      to have your familiar gain all the normal benefits of being a familiar, as
      the wizard&#8217;s arcane bond option (including type, Intelligence bonus,
      and special abilities), but doing so incurs the normal replacement cost
      should your familiar die. If the ability which grants you a familiar loses
      any of the normal benefits of being a familiar, your familiar does not
      gain that ability.</p>
