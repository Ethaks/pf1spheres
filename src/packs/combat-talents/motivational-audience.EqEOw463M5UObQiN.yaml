      <p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever an ally that can see you or
      hear you within 60 ft. would perform an action that would allow you to
      boast (such as confirming a critical hit, reducing an enemy to 0 or fewer
      hit points, etc.), you may expend your martial focus to boast as an
      immediate action, treating it as if you had performed the action.</p>
