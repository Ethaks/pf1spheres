      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Wall Stunt,
      Acrobatics 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (leap) package, you no longer require a solid
      surface to make your swift action jump with the Wall Stunt talent. While
      you have martial focus, the DC for Acrobatics checks to determine jump
      height have their DC reduced to 1 per 1 ft. of height. Additionally, you
      may reduce the effective height of any fall by an additional 10 ft. on a
      successful Acrobatics check.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (run) package, you may run over the air as if it
      were ground. You do not fall when moving, though if you are not supported
      at the end of your turn you fall as normal.</p>

      <p>You may ascend or descend up to 45 degrees as part of this movement,
      though ascending costs 2 squares of movement per 5 ft. of additional
      elevation. Additionally, you may balance on any solid surface, even those
      unable to support your weight, such as a taught string, a narrow tree
      branch, etc.</p>
