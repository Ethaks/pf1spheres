      <p>As part of an attack action, you may roll an Acrobatics check to jump
      against the CMD of any adjacent creature. If your roll exceeds their CMD,
      you may jump to any other square adjacent to that creature that would
      enable flanking with your starting position without provoking an attack of
      opportunity for movement, and you may treat the creature as flanked by you
      for the attack action. If unsuccessful, you instead provoke an attack of
      opportunity from the targeted creature and do not complete your
      movement.</p>
