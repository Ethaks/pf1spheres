    value: >
      <p>Whenever you use the attack action or an attack of opportunity to
      attack or disarm a creature, you deal an additional 1 point of bleed
      damage to the target on a successful attempt, +1 for every 3 points of
      base attack bonus you possess; this stacks with any other bleed damage you
      are capable of dealing. Practitioners of the Duelist sphere never provoke
      attacks of opportunity when attempting combat maneuvers against a target
      currently taking bleed damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Bleed:</strong> Some talents have the (bleed) descriptor; these
      talents are triggered when you deal bleed damage to a creature using your
      blooded strike. You may only apply the effects of a single (bleed) talent
      to a given attack. A target that is immune to bleed damage is also immune
      to all other effects of talents with this descriptor. For the purpose of
      these talents, only bleed damage you deal with your blooded strike is
      considered when determining their effects.</p>

      <p><strong>Disarm:</strong> Some talents have the (disarm) descriptor;
      these talents trigger whenever you succeed at a disarm attempt against a
      creature. You may only apply the effects of a single (disarm) talent to a
      given disarm attempt. (Disarm) talents cannot be applied to maneuvers
      performed as a free action.</p>
