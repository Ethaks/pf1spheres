      <p>You may choose for your poison to not cause fatigue, but instead to
      enhance the mental aptitude of those subjected to it (this talent cannot
      be used with a contact or inhaled poison). Those who are under the effects
      of this poison gain a +2 alchemical bonus to either their Intelligence,
      Wisdom, or Charisma (chosen upon creation) and a -2 penalty to one of the
      creature&#8217;s physical scores for 1 minute. If this enhances the
      creature&#8217;s Intelligence, it applies a penalty to their Strength. If
      it enhances the creature&#8217;s Wisdom, it applies a penalty to their
      Dexterity. If it enhances the creature&#8217;s Charisma, it applies a
      penalty to their Constitution. At the end of this talent&#8217;s duration,
      the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened for 10
      minutes. If you possess at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy), this bonus
      increases by +2. A creature cannot benefit from an Academic Enhancer more
      than once per hour.</p>
