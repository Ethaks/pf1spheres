      <p>Some of your followers are well-versed in lore and arcane studies. Any
      allied creature may treat the followers as an extensive library for the
      purpose of researching knowledge checks (normally requiring 1d4
      hours).</p>

      <p>Scholars can identify magic items with a Spellcraft check of 15 + your
      ranks in Diplomacy.</p>

      <p>Any Knowledge, Linguistics, Spellcraft, or Use Magic Device checks made
      while with the followers automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus from
      the scholars&#8217; aid. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in
      Diplomacy that you possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Merchants talent, you gain a 25% discount on scrolls
      purchased from the caravan.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Magic capital in place of earning gold, with 50 gp equaling 1
      Magic. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This
      stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>
