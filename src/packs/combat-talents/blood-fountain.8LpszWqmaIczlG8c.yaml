      <p>Blood you spill tends to splatter. Creatures suffering from your bleed
      damage spill blood into any squares they occupy at the beginning of their
      turns, causing it to become slick and slippery. Moving into a square with
      slippery terrain requires a Reflex save to move at more than half speed
      for that action. Failure causes the creature to become flat-footed until
      the end of their turn, and stops their movement for that action. Failure
      by 5 or more causes the creature to fall prone and be considered
      flat-footed until the start of their next turn. Slippery terrain created
      by this talent dries up and becomes normal terrain after 10 minutes.</p>
