    value: >
      <p>You may make an attack action at the end of a charge in place of the
      normally granted attack. You may not combine this attack with the pounce
      ability. Abilities that multiply damage dealt on a charge, such as the
      Spirited Charge feat or wielding a lance while making a mounted charge,
      may not be used with this talent.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you can use the charge rules to make a thrown weapon
      attack. All the parameters of a charge apply, except that you must only
      move closer to the creature, and you must end your movement within 30 ft.
      of that creature. If you do, you can make an attack action using a thrown
      weapon attack against that creature, gaining the +2 bonus on the attack
      roll and taking a &#8211;2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next
      turn. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Charging Hurler.</p>
