      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you can sense nearby alcohol or
      creatures with the drunk condition within 30 feet. This effect functions
      as blindsense.</p>

      <p>In addition, as long as you have the drunk status, whenever you attempt
      a Perception or Survival check, you gain a +2 competence bonus on that
      check. This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 base attack bonus you
      have.</p>
