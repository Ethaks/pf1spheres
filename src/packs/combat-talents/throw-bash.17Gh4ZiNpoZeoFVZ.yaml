      <p>You gain proficiency with throwing shields. Ranged attacks made with a
      throwing shield incorporate shield spikes into their damage calculation as
      normal. Additionally, if you have the Cover Ally talent, you may treat any
      ally within your shield&#8217;s first range increment as being within your
      shield&#8217;s reach by throwing it as part of the active defense action.
      You may apply a (deflect) talent to this active defense as normal,
      performing any additional actions by ricocheting the shield off of the
      attack. If your shield has the returning property, or you have the
      Throwing Mastery talent, it returns after using Cover Ally as if you made
      an attack with it.</p>
