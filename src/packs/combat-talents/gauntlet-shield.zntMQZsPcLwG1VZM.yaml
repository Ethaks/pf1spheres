    value: >
      <p>You may treat a cestus, gauntlet, or spiked gauntlet as a buckler,
      gaining the +1 shield bonus to AC as normal for a buckler. The
      weapon&#8217;s enhancement bonus to attack and damage also applies to the
      shield bonus granted by the weapon. You lose this bonus if you attack with
      the weapon or wield another weapon in the same hand unless you possess an
      ability to retain your shield bonus when making a shield bash attack, such
      as the Bashing Shield talent of the Shield sphere or the Improved Shield
      Bash feat. Making an attack with this weapon may count as making a shield
      bash if beneficial.</p>
