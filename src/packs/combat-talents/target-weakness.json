      "value": "<p>If you have successfully used the scout ability to identify a target&#8217;s weaknesses, you may use scavenged materials collected as you travel to improvise a weapon targeting one of those weaknesses as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity; you may expend your martial focus to instead use this ability as a free action. The next attack you make against the target with a manufactured or natural weapon attack, including traps, is treated as though half the total damage it deals (rounded down) were of an energy type the target has vulnerability to (for example, if you fire an arrow at a red dragon, who has vulnerability to cold damage, and would normally deal 14 points of piercing damage, you instead deal 7 points of piercing damage and 10 points of cold damage); if this attack is not made before the end of your next turn, this effect is wasted.</p>\n<p>Additional energy damage dealt by the attack, such as from the flaming or frost weapon special abilities, is calculated separately from this effect. Alternatively, your weapons are treated as having one type listed in the target&#8217;s damage reduction (for example, if an enemy has DR 5/cold iron or good, you may treat your attacks as either good or cold iron for 1 round).</p>\n",
