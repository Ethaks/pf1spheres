    value: >
      <p>You may choose for your poison to not cause fatigue instantly, but
      instead to enhance the concentration of those subjected to it (this talent
      cannot be used with a contact or inhaled poison). Those who are under the
      effects of this poison gain a +3 alchemical bonus to their concentration
      checks, but suffer an equivalent penalty to Perception checks for 1
      minute. At the end of this talent&#8217;s duration, the creature must
      succeed at a Fortitude save or be fatigued for 10 minutes. If you possess
      at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy), this bonus increases by +2. A
      creature cannot benefit from a concentration aid more than once per
      hour.</p>
