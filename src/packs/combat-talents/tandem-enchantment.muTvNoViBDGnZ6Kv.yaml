      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dual Wielding sphere (Tandem
      Offensive), base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>As long as you have martial focus, your off-hand weapon gains all of
      the special weapon abilities and the enhancement bonus your main-hand
      possesses, replacing any enhancement bonuses or special weapon abilities
      your off-hand weapon may possess at the time. This does not allow your
      off-hand weapon to benefit from abilities that are not applicable to that
      weapon, and does not grant any other effects that your main-hand weapon
      possesses, such as the unique benefits of a holy avenger.</p>
