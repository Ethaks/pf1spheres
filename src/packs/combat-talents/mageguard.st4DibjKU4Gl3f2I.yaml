    value: >
      <p>When a hostile creature within your threatened area attempts to cast a
      spell defensively, they take a penalty to their concentration check equal
      to 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1). The creature is aware of this
      penalty. This ability stacks with the Disruptive feat and similar
      effects.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (challenge) package, if the creature is under the
      effects of your challenge, they provoke an attack of opportunity from you
      whenever they fail a concentration check to cast a spell defensively.</p>
