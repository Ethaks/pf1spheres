      "value": "<p>Whenever you make a melee attack using the attack action, you may choose to take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made that round. If your attack hits, you may make an additional attack as a free action against a creature that is adjacent to the first and also within your reach. If this additional attack hits, you may make another additional attack against a new target adjacent to the struck target. You may continue attacking targets adjacent to your most recent struck target as long as you still have a valid target for this ability, but you cannot attack the same creature twice. The number of additional attacks made with this ability cannot exceed 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1).</p>\n<p>You can take this talent a second time, allowing you to take a single 5-ft. step as a free action after making an attack when using this ability. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional attack(s) as long as it meets all the other prerequisites. Your movement with this talent cannot exceed your move speed. <strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Cleave, Great Cleave, Cleave Through when taken twice.</p>\n",
