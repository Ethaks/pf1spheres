      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, Alchemy sphere
      (Witchbane).</p>

      <p>You may choose for your poison to induce a -1 caster level penalty to
      the creature instead of causing fatigue. Creatures who fail two
      consecutive saving throws against this increase this penalty by 1, and
      creatures who fail three consecutive saving throws, and every failed
      consecutive saving throw thereafter increase this penalty by 2. Casters
      with a penalty to their caster level that exceeds their base caster level
      cannot cast spells.</p>
