      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>

      <p>An improved fuse grenade may be lit and thrown into an unoccupied
      square capable of supporting an object within 60 ft. as a standard action.
      1d3 rounds after being lit, the grenade explodes, dealing 2d6 points of
      bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage in a 20-foot-radius burst
      (Reflex halves). For every 3 ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess, both
      the bludgeoning and fire damage from this item increase by an additional
      1d6. You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; each
      time you do so, the radius increases by 10 ft. and the Reflex save DC
      increases by +1.</p>
