      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Intimidate ranks 4, Gladiator
      sphere.</p>

      <p>While in this stance, whenever an ally that you can see would be
      reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, you can perform a boast once per round
      as a free action that can be taken outside of your normal turn.
      Additionally, allies who are unconscious can benefit from your boasts; a
      dying ally who is affected by your boast immediately becomes stabilized.
      When stabilized in this way, the ally still attempts stabilization checks;
      if they succeed, they regain 1 hit point, become conscious (if they were
      not already), and stop attempting stabilization checks.</p>
