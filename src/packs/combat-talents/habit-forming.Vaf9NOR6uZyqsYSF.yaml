    value: >
      <p>You can imbue poisons you create with the Alchemy sphere with highly
      addictive qualities. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against your
      Alchemy sphere poison, it must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. On a
      failed saving throw, the creature develops an addiction to that poison.
      Creatures who fail their saving throw gain a minor addiction, which
      increases to moderate and severe with additional subsequent failed saving
      throws against this talent. Penalties from this addiction begin 24 hours
      after first becoming addicted.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>A minor addiction causes the creature to suffer a -2 penalty to
      Constitution.</li>

      <li>A moderate addiction increases this penalty to -4 to Strength and
      Constitution.</li>

      <li>A severe addiction increases this penalty to -6 to Strength,
      Dexterity, and Constitution.These penalties are suppressed for 24 hours
      whenever the creature fails a saving throw against the poison.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>Each day the creature does not fail a saving throw against your Alchemy
      sphere poisons, it may attempt a Fortitude save against your Alchemy
      sphere DC. After succeeding at a save in this fashion, the DC is reduced
      by 2. If it succeeds at 2 consecutive saves, its addiction also reduces by
      one level (or disappears, if it only has a minor addiction).</p>
