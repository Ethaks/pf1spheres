    value: >
      <p>When you have martial focus, when a creature makes a melee attack or
      combat maneuver against you, you may spend an immediate action to make a
      touch attack against that creature, dealing damage equal to your
      practitioner modifier + your base attack bonus. Regardless of if your
      attack is successful or not, you then immediately fall prone (you may not
      use this talent if you are unable to become prone or already prone). At
      +10 base attack bonus, this talent instead deals damage equal to your
      unarmed strike.</p>
