      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Leadership sphere.</p>

      <p>When recruiting for a cohort you can seek more exotic creatures types
      which are determined by form instead of race. In place of a race, the
      cohort is created using the base statistics and body type of a Conjuration
      sphere companion form of Small or Medium size, and has 1 (form) talent
      (excluding the Battle Creature, Boon Companion, Lingering Companion, or
      Staff Wielding Companion/Implement Bearer talent) as if they were a
      summoned companion. You substitute your rank in Diplomacy for any effect
      that depends on caster level. These type of cohorts may possess any kind
      of creature type and subtype appropriate to their concept (although they
      do not gain the immunities or other qualities of its creature type). When
      recruiting for the creature, modifiers based on race are instead based
      upon creature type and subtype. When the GM creates the cohort, they may
      choose to grant the creature an additional Conjuration sphere (form)
      talent in place of a feat.</p>
