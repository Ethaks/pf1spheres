      <p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever a creature attempts to make
      an attack of opportunity against you, they must roll their attack roll
      twice, taking the worse result. Creatures capable of making multiple
      attacks of opportunity per round may instead expend two attacks of
      opportunity instead of one to make an attack of opportunity as normal.</p>
