      <p>As long as you have a readied action to perform a counter punch, you
      may abandon your readied action as a free action (even if it is not your
      turn) and regain martial focus. Abandoning a readied action with this
      talent does not grant you additional actions.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may forgo selecting an additional trigger in favor of
      self defense. For each additional trigger you forgo selecting when
      readying your counter punch, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your
      armor class until the start of your next turn.</p>
