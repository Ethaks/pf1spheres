      <p>Whenever you use a successful grapple check to deal damage, you deal an
      additional +2 damage and the creature takes a -2 penalty on the next
      grapple check they make against you as long as it is made within 1 minute.
      For every 5 points of base attack bonus you possess, this damage and
      penalty increases by +2/-1 respectively.</p>
