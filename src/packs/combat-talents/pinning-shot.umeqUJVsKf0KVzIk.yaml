      <p>On a successful deadly shot, the target of your attack gains the
      grappled condition. A target grappled by a projectile can break free by
      destroying the weapon or ammo used in the attack (hardness 5, hit points
      1, break DC 13 for arrows and bolts) or with an Escape Artist or combat
      maneuver check made as a move action against your CMD -4.</p>
