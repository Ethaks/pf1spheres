      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (followers) package,
      Diplomacy 10 ranks.</p>

      <p>Your caravan is equipped with flying beasts, airships, arcane
      levitation, or other means of reliable overland flight. Terrain and ground
      obstacles do not hinder your caravan&#8217;s speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> The prerequisite ranks in Diplomacy may be
      reduced based on how common flight is in the setting. In the Skybourne
      setting, for example, flight is common and airships are ubiquitous, so the
      Diplomacy prerequisite can be ignored entirely.</p>
