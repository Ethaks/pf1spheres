    value: >
      <p>As a special attack action, you may expend your martial focus to make
      two attacks with your unarmed strike, targeting the creature&#8217;s touch
      AC and dealing 1/2 damage on a successful attack (making more than one
      successful attack with this talent still only counts as a single
      successful attack for the purpose of feats and class features which grant
      bonuses upon landing multiple successful attacks); each attack after the
      first is made as a free action. The creature may choose to automatically
      block all of these attacks, in which case your unarmed strikes
      automatically miss, but that creature then takes a -2 penalty to all
      attack and damage rolls until they take a Total Defense action or until
      they are not subject to any hostile actions for one round. For every 4
      points of base attack bonus you possess, you may make an additional
      unarmed strike as part of this attack action, and the penalty that
      creature takes for blocking your Suppressive Rush increases by -2.</p>
