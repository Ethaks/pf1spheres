    value: >
      <p>When targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, you may delay the onset
      of its effects until the end of your next turn as if it were damage. Each
      effect is treated as if it were an amount of hit point damage equal to its
      caster level for the purpose of your delayed damage pool. If you do not
      have enough space remaining in the delayed damage pool, you may not delay
      the effect.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (patrol) package and the Defend Other talent, when
      an ally within the area of your patrol is the target of a spell or
      spell-like ability, you may spend an attack of opportunity to move to put
      that ally within reach (with the normal limits for moving as part of your
      patrol) and redirect the effect to yourself.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (challenge) package, any time a creature under the
      effects of your challenge casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability that
      does not include you in its effect, it suffers a -2 penalty to the
      spell&#8217;s save DC. This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 points of
      base attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Per discussion with the author, this
      is intended to permit characters to cure effects caused by things this
      ability can delay before they take effect.</sup></p>
