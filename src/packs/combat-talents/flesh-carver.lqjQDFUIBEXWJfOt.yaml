    value: >
      <p>Your weapons rend through flesh, sinew, and bone alike. The creature
      damaged by your brutal strike has their damage reduction reduced by an
      amount equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1). This reduction
      lasts for as long as the target has the battered condition. This reduction
      does not stack with itself.</p>

      <p>The benefits of this talent are halved (minimum 1) when applied to
      damage reduction that cannot be overcome or is overcome only by epic
      weapons (such as DR 3/&#8211; or DR 20/epic).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess mythic ranks, the benefits of
      this talent are no longer halved against DR/epic.</p>
