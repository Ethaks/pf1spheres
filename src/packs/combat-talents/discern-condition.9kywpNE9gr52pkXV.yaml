      <p>You may use the scout ability to determine the relative health and
      condition of a creature within line of sight and effect in addition to the
      normal information provided by your scout ability. You determine the
      creature&#8217;s condition based on the list below:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Has at least 90% of full normal hit points,
      free of disease.</li>

      <li><strong>Fair:</strong> 30% to 90% of full normal hit points
      remaining.</li>

      <li><strong>Poor:</strong> Less than 30% of full normal hit points
      remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating
      injury.</li>

      <li><strong>Weak:</strong> 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with
      a disease that has reduced an ability score to 5 or less, or
      crippled.</li>

      </ul>
