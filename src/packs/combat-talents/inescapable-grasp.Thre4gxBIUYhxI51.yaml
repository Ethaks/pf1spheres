      <p>Whenever a creature attempts to magically escape a grapple with a
      teleportation or Warp effect, you may make a special combat maneuver check
      against their CMD as an immediate action. If successful, the escape fails
      and they provoke an attack of opportunity from you. At +10 base attack
      bonus, if you make a grapple attempt against a creature under the effect
      of a freedom of movement spell or similar effect, that effect is
      suppressed for the duration of the grapple.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This talent only applies against
      teleportation effects originating from the grappled target, not from any
      source. At 10+ base attack bonus, this talent can suppress freedom of
      movement and other similar effects (like the Fate sphere's Freedom
      (word)), regardless of their source.</p>
