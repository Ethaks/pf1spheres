    value: >
      <p>You ceremoniously swing the creature&#8217;s body up over your back
      before dropping them onto their back.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wrestling sphere, base attack bonus
      +10.</p>

      <p>The creature suffers 1 negative level and must succeed at a Reflex save
      or fall prone. Negative levels caused by this talent last for a number of
      hours equal to your base attack bonus. This is a supernatural effect;
      using this slam immediately ends your grapple on the creature. If you
      expend martial focus when using this talent, a creature who fails their
      Reflex saving throw suffers 1 additional negative level for every 10
      points of base attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p>In addition, the first time each round a creature suffering from
      negative levels attacks you, that creature provokes an attack of
      opportunity from you. You can use this attack of opportunity to grapple
      the creature even if you could not normally grapple on an attack of
      opportunity.</p>
