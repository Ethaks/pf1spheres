      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 15</p>

      <p>Cherry bombs are alchemical bombs that make up for their lack of power
      with volume and easy maintenance. Crafting a cluster of cherry bombs
      counts as crafting a single alchemical formulae when determining the total
      number of formulae you can craft at a time and the total number you may
      have crafted at once. A cluster of cherry bombs has a number of bombs in
      it equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 3). Cherry bombs are a
      splash weapon you can use as a ranged touch attack with a range increment
      of 10 feet, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage + 1d4 per 3 Craft (alchemy)
      ranks you possess to the target of a direct hit, and 1 point of
      bludgeoning splash damage per die of damage this weapon deals on a direct
      hit to targets 5 feet away from the point of contact (to a maximum of half
      the damage dealt to the primary target).</p>

      <p>An individual cherry bomb cannot be split apart from its cluster for
      more than 1 round without becoming inert. An individual cherry bomb may be
      modified (such as by being placed into a vial arrow) without being split
      from its cluster. An entire cluster of cherry bombs is required to make a
      coating if used with the Chemical Coating talent.</p>

      <p>If you can create formulae that inflict different types of damage (such
      as an alchemist&#8217;s fire dealing fire damage) when you create the
      cherry bombs you may have it deal that kind of damage instead. The damage
      can only be of one damage type at a time, but each separate bomb can deal
      a different type of damage. You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon
      in increments of 10; each time you do so, the Reflex save DC to avoid the
      splash damage increases by +1.</p>
