    value: >
      <p>While mounted on a creature of your size or larger, you may take cover
      behind your mount as a move action. You may expend martial focus to reduce
      this to an immediate action. Your mount provides total cover from one
      direction. When using a mount in this way, you must choose one edge of
      your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you
      only. You gain total cover for attacks that pass through this edge. Your
      mount may still be targeted as usual. Should this ability be used in
      reaction to being targeted by an attack roll, the attacking creature may
      choose a new target. You may end this effect by using the same action
      required to mount a willing mount (normally a move action, a free action
      with a DC20 Ride check).</p>
