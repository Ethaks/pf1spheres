      <p>You can use your total Perform (dance) bonus in place of your
      Acrobatics or Intimidate bonuses. Any creature which watches you make a
      Perform (dance) check outside of combat must make a Will save (using the
      result of your Perform (dance) check to determine the save DC) or be
      fascinated for up to 1 minute. Once a creature has been affected by this
      talent, they cannot be affected by it again for 1 day.</p>
