      <p>Whenever you or an ally benefiting from this tactic successfully deal
      damage to an enemy with an attack made using the attack action, the
      individual who made the attack may attempt a bull rush or reposition
      combat maneuver against the target of the attack as a free action that
      does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you possess 10 or more ranks
      in Diplomacy, the forced movement caused by the maneuver provokes an
      attack of opportunity from threatening allies other than the one
      initiating the movement.</p>
