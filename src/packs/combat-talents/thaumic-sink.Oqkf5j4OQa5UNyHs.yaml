      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Trap sphere, Craft (traps) 15
      ranks.</p>

      <p>When used with a dart trap, a creature that is struck by your dart
      becomes affected as if he were inside of an antimagic field, as per the
      spell. This effect persists for 1 round per rank in Craft (traps) you
      possess or until a full-round action is spent removing the dart. A dart
      may be removed as a standard action, but doing so inflicts damage equal to
      the dart&#8217;s minimum damage. When used with a snare trap, a 10-ft.
      radius around the triggering square is covered in an antimagic field per
      the spell. This effect persists for 1 round per rank in Craft (traps) you
      possess.</p>

      <p>An antimagic field suppresses any spell or magical effect used within,
      brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent
      within an antimagic field counts against the suppressed spell&#8217;s
      duration. Summoned creatures of any type wink out if they enter an
      antimagic field. They reappear in the same spot once the field goes
      away.</p>

      <p>This trap is a spell-like ability, using your ranks in Craft (trap) as
      your caster level.</p>
