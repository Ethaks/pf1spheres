      <p>While in this stance, whenever a creature within reach misses you with
      a melee attack, you may expend an attack of opportunity to perform a feint
      against that creature as a free action that can be taken outside of your
      normal turn. You may not use this talent in conjunction with (deflect)
      talents or any other ability that would grant you an attack or combat
      maneuver due to a missed attack against you.</p>
