      <p>You gain a bonus equal to 1 + 1 per 4 ranks you possess in the Craft
      (alchemy) skill on saving throws against any alchemical item you use or
      create. In addition, whenever you and an adjacent creature would both be
      affected by one of your alchemical items, you can forego the normal bonus
      granted by this ability and apply it as a penalty to the creature&#8217;s
      AC or saving throws against the item&#8217;s effects or attacks made with
      the item.</p>
