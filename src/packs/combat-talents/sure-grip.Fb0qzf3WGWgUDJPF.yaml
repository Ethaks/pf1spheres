    value: >
      <p>Once per round when a creature attempts a disarm or steal combat
      maneuver against you, or uses a similar ability that would remove a weapon
      or item from your grasp, you may attempt a Climb check as a free action
      that can be taken even when it&#8217;s not your turn, using the result in
      place of your CMD for the triggering maneuver. In addition, you never drop
      held items when subject to the panicked, unconscious, or stunned
      conditions and gain a +10 competence bonus on Climb checks to catch
      yourself or another creature when falling (or when ending your movement
      when using the Rope Swinger or Wall Stunt talents).</p>
