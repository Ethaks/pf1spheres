      <p>While in this stance, whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature in
      the same round that you draw the weapon used to deal that damage, the
      first melee attack a creature damaged this way makes against you within
      your reach provokes an attack of opportunity from you until the beginning
      of your next turn. You may not use this talent in conjunction with
      (deflect) talents or any other ability that would grant you an attack or
      combat maneuver due to a missed attack against you.</p>
