      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Blood sphere or Duelist sphere (Ooze
      Ichor); base attack bonus +1 or caster level 1st.</p>

      <p>You can manipulate a creature&#8217;s essence as though it were blood.
      You may affect any creature with your Blood sphere abilities which use or
      target their blood (such as initiating blood control, using a (quicken) or
      (still), or using a blood art), bypassing any immunity to bleed damage or
      immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save a creature may possess.
      This talent does not bypass other immunities a creature may possess.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may cause creatures to bleed even when they normally
      could not. Whenever you would inflict bleed damage to a creature, you
      ignore any immunity to bleed damage that creature may possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> Essence Manipulation may be selected as a
      legendary Duelist talent, and is a supernatural effect.</p>
