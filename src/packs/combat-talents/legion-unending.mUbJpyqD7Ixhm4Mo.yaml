      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere, Rousing Claxon,
      Diplomacy 10 ranks.</p>

      <p>Whenever an ally affected by this tactic would be reduced to 0 or fewer
      hit points, you may spend an immediate action to grant them a number of
      temporary hit points equal to twice your ranks in Diplomacy. These
      temporary hit points are applied directly to the damage dealt first, with
      any remaining temporary hit points applied after the attack is resolved.
      This ability may be used as a free action that can be taken even when
      it&#8217;s not your turn, though doing so expends your martial focus and
      ends the tactic.</p>
