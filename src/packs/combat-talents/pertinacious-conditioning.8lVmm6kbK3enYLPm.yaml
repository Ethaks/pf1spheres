    value: >
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brute sphere, base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>The creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or be unable to
      willingly move from their square for 1 round for every 5 points of base
      attack bonus you possess. This is a supernatural mind-affecting fear
      effect. A creature may attempt a new saving throw against this effect once
      per round as a move action. If your combat maneuver exceeds the
      creature&#8217;s CMD by 5 or more, you may attempt an Intimidate check to
      demoralize that creature as an immediate action.</p>
