      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere, Shatter Earth,
      Wrestling sphere, Earth-Shattering Slam, base attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>Whenever you successfully use Earth-Shattering Slam against a target,
      you may choose to bury them underground.</p>

      <p>The target travels 5 ft. through the ground for every 5 base attack
      bonus you possess. If this would put the target completely through the
      ground (such as dropping them through the roof of a building) they fall to
      the ground below, taking falling damage as normal. If the new ground is
      still within 5 ft. per 5 base attack bonus, they may also travel through
      into or through that surface to reach this talent&#8217;s limit.</p>

      <p>So long as the target is entangled from your Earth-Shattering Slam,
      they also cannot breath and must hold their breath or begin suffocating.
      Even if they escape the entanglement, they must still climb, fly, or
      otherwise exit the hole they are in.</p>
