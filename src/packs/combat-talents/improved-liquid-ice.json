      "value": "<p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>\n<p>You create a flask of liquid that when opened begins to hiss and evaporate. You can open this flask and pour out the contents in order to freeze a liquid (one 5-foot cube per 2 ranks of Craft (alchemy)) or coat an area of liquid, 20 feet in diameter, in a layer of ice strong enough to support Medium-sized creatures.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can throw the flask as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet, dealing 1d6 cold damage + 1d6 per 3 ranks of Craft (alchemy) you possess to the target of a direct hit and half that damage to targets 5 feet from the point of contact, (to a maximum of half the damage dealt to the primary target) and 1 point of cold splash damage per die of damage this weapon deals to targets 10 feet away. Targets directly hit by this alchemical weapon must make a Fortitude save or be staggered and have their movement speed reduced by half for one round.</p>\n<p>You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each time you do so, the range for each damage increment increase by 5 feet (for example, if you increase the Craft DC to 35, you deal full damage to all targets within 5 feet of the point of contact, half damage to all targets 10 feet away from the point of contact, and 1 point of damage to all creatures within 15 feet.) and the number of frozen cubes of liquid doubles. This also doubles the diameter of a layer of ice, and the maximum size of the creatures it can support increases by 1 size category.</p>\n",
