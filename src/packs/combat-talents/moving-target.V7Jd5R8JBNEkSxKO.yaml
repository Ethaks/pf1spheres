      <p>When moving more than 5 ft. during your turn using the movement mode
      corresponding to a package you possess, you gain a 20% miss chance against
      ranged attacks until the start of your next turn. If you move more than 20
      ft., you may expend your martial focus as a free action to increase this
      miss chance to 50%. If you take this talent a second time, the miss chance
      applies to all attacks made against you. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong>
      Wind Stance.</p>
