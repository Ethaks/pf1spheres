      <p>Whenever you succeed on a trip attempt against a grappled creature, you
      may immediately move both yourself and the grappled creature up to 10 ft.
      in any direction except up as a free action. This movement provokes
      attacks of opportunity for both you and the grappled target. For every 5
      points of base attack bonus you possess, you may move yourself and the
      target an additional 10 ft.</p>
