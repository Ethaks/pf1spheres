      <p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever you would successfully make
      an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from an
      enemy when you move through its threatened area or its space, the enemy
      must succeed on a Will save or become battered for 1 round. If you move
      more than half your base speed, the battered condition lasts for 1
      additional round for every 5 ranks in the skill associated with the
      package you possess.</p>
