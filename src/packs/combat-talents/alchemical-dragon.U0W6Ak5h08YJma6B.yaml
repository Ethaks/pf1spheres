      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere, Barroom sphere.</p>

      <p>You may choose to imbibe any liquid alchemical weapon you are currently
      holding (such as alchemist&#8217;s fire or liquid ice), treating it as
      though it was an alcoholic beverage. When you do, you may spit it out in a
      10-ft. cone as a standard action as long as you do so within a number of
      rounds equal to your practitioner modifier (if you do not, the alchemical
      weapon is wasted), forcing all creatures within that cone to make a
      successful Reflex save or take damage as though they were directly hit by
      the alchemical item, taking 1/2 damage on a successful save. If you imbibe
      a new liquid alchemical weapon before spitting a previously imbibed one,
      the previously imbibed liquid alchemical weapon is wasted. For every 5
      base attack bonus you possess, the area of this cone increases by 5
      ft.</p>
