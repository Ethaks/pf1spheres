      <p>You can use counter punch with ranged attacks, except that instead of
      readying an action to make an attack against the next enemy who makes a
      melee attack roll against you before the beginning of your next round, you
      ready an action to make an attack against the next enemy who makes an
      attack roll within your first range increment before the beginning of your
      next round. You may select additional triggers for counter punch as
      normal, except that they must be within your first range increment in
      order to trigger your counter punch.</p>
