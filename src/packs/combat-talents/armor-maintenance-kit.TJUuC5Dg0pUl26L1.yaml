      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 20</p>

      <p>When you create this formulae you may choose to create it as a polish
      kit or a lubrication kit.</p>

      <p><strong>Polish Kit:</strong> You create a specialized polish that can
      be applied to armor to give it an immaculate shine. Armor polish may only
      be applied to a single piece of armor once every 24 hours. A ray striking
      a creature wearing polished armor has a 20% chance to be deflected,
      causing no effect. Once a single ray has been deflected in this way the
      armor loses its shine and can no longer deflect rays. You may not apply a
      polish kit to a suit of armor affected by the polish blacksmith
      maintenance. The Craft DC may be increased in increments of 10 to allow
      the armor to deflect an additional ray for each increment.</p>

      <p><strong>Lubrication Kit:</strong> You create special lubricant that can
      be applied to the joints of a suit of armor. This lubricant reduces the
      armor check penalty of a suit of armor by 1 + 1 per 10 ranks in Craft
      (alchemy) you possess. Lubricated armor can also be donned and doffed
      twice as fast. The lubricant lasts for 2 hours before being rendered
      useless. You may not apply a lubrication kit to suit of armor affected by
      the armor maintenance blacksmith maintenance. You can increase the Craft
      DC in increments of 10 to also have the lubricant increase the maximum
      Dexterity bonus of the armor by 1 and increase the duration by 2
      hours.</p>
