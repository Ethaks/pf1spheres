      <p>You may recruit adventurers, mercenaries, and sellswords to actively
      assist you. Recruiting requires spending 8 hours in a settlement and
      making a Diplomacy check. You may select the profession and martial
      tradition you are looking for, and may also specify a particular race from
      those available. Not all races, professions, and traditions will be
      available in all locations; the available pool is determined by the GM.
      The base DC of this check is 10 + the Hit Dice of the person you are
      looking to recruit, modified per Settlement Size Modifier and
      Miscellaneous Modifier tables. Modifiers are cumulative. You may take 10
      on this check.</p>

      <p>You may not recruit a creature with more Hit Dice than the maximum
      shown on Table: Cohort. The exact feats and talents the cohort possesses
      are up to the GM, though you may reject a given cohort and attempt to
      recruit another with the normal action. Recruits are usually humanoids
      with no racial Hit Dice, and are of races available in the region you are
      recruiting. Creatures with racial Hit Dice, templates, or abilities
      unsuitable to player races are not suitable to be cohorts.</p>

      <p>You may have multiple recruited creatures under your control, but their
      total Hit Dice cannot exceed your ranks in Diplomacy. If you attempt to
      recruit a creature that would exceed your Hit Dice cap, you must choose
      which other creatures to release from your service.</p>

      <p>A cohort serves you loyally and will follow you into and aid you during
      combat, but will not obey obviously suicidal orders nor subject itself to
      harm for no obvious purpose. Cohorts are usually within 1 alignment step
      of you, though some exceptions may occur at the GM&#8217;s discretion.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Effects that increase effective BAB or
      skill ranks in a sphere do not accelerate the strength of leadership
      cohorts or similar partners, just as increasing your caster level does not
      accelerate the hit dice of Conjuration sphere companions. Only effects
      that actually raise your effective level, such as the Spherebound mythic
      quality or a Conscript sphere specialization, can increase the hit dice of
      cohorts and similar companions.</sup></p>

      <p>Cohorts gain abilities based on their Hit Dice and race. The listed
      statistics are modified by the cohort&#8217;s race as normal. Cohorts are
      considered to have a CR equal to their Hit Dice - 2 for purposes that
      require it. Cohorts have class skills according to their creature type
      (Climb, Craft, Handle Animal, Heal, Profession, Ride, and Survival for
      humanoids), plus the ones listed in their profession. Select from the
      following professions to determine the cohort&#8217;s base statistics:</p>

      checks.; <strong>Budding Academic:</strong> Students gain an additional 4
      skill points per Hit Die that must be spent on Intelligence-based skills.
      <strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> Alchemy kit, simple melee or ranged
      weapon with 20 pieces ammunition</p>

      Appraise, Disguise, Disable Device, Perception, Sleight of Hand, Stealth;
      <strong>Rogue Training:</strong> Thieves may take rogue talents in place
      of feats and gain the following ability: <em>Trapfinding:</em> A thief
      cohort adds 1/2 her level to Perception skill checks made to locate traps
      and to Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A thief cohort can use
      Disable Device to disarm magic traps. <strong>Starting Equipment:</strong>
      Studded leather armor, thieves tools, One of: 1. Simple or martial melee
      weapon and simple or martial ranged weapon with 20 pieces ammunition, or

      gain a bonus equal to half their Hit Dice on all Climb and Swim skill
      checks as well as on Constitution-based ability checks. <strong>Starting
      Equipment:</strong> scale mail or studded leather armor, One of: 1. Simple
      or martial melee weapon and simple or martial ranged weapon with 20 pieces
      ammunition 2. Simple or martial melee weapon and shield</p>

      <p><strong>Woodsman</strong><br>

      <strong>Hit Dice</strong> d10; <strong>Saves</strong> Fort (good), Ref

      <strong>Starting Equipment</strong> Studded leather armor, a simple or
      martial melee weapon and simple or martial ranged weapon with 20 pieces
      ammunition</p>

      <p>When a cohort gains variable starting equipment (for example, a choice
      of weapons or shields) the total cost of the combined weapons, ammunition,
      and/or shield cannot exceed 100 gp.</p>

      <p>All cohorts are proficient with simple weapons, light armor, and
      bucklers. Cohorts begin play with leather armor and a dagger in addition
      to any equipment listed in their descriptions; further equipment must be
      supplied to them. A cohort&#8217;s starting gear may not be used to
      increase PC wealth; it cannot normally be sold and if extreme
      circumstances occur where the PCs benefit from its loss, it must be
      replaced (or wealth sufficient to pay for replacements given) at the
      earliest possible time. If the cohort is deceased, this payment must be
      made to their next of kin or other designee (it is assumed that such a
      person always exists as part of normal recruitment). If a cohort is
      equipped with additional items, the cohort will not keep them if leaving
      your service.</p>

      <p>When you gain a level and your ranks in Diplomacy increase, you may
      assign an additional Hit Die to current cohorts, up to the maximum they
      may possess and not causing the total Hit Dice you have recruited to
      exceed your limit.</p>

      <p><strong>Feats:</strong> A cohort begins with one feat, and gains
      another feat at every odd Hit Die. A cohort may gain any PC feat for which
      it qualifies. Cohorts may not gain magic item crafting feats.</p>

      <p><strong>Combat Talents:</strong> Cohorts gains talents with the
      proficient progression.</p>

      <p><strong>Martial Tradition:</strong> Your cohort gains a martial
      tradition, using the practitioner modifier given by their profession.</p>

      <p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Just like PCs and Monsters, a
      cohort gains a permanent +1 bonus to an ability score of your choice for
      every 4 Hit Dice possessed.</p>

      <p><strong>Enhancement:</strong> At 5 Hit Dice, a cohort gains a +2
      enhancement bonus to one ability score. At 9th level, they increase this
      bonus to +4 and gain a +2 bonus to an additional ability score. At 13th
      level, the first bonus increases to +6, the second to +4, and they gain a
      +2 bonus to an additional ability score. These bonuses may be retrained as
      if they were a single feat.</p>

      <p>Talents marked (cohort) grant additional options for your cohorts. Some
      abilities call out joint actions. These actions require both the user and
      his cohort to pay the requisite action cost.</p>

      <h3 id="toc5"><span>Re-Recruiting Cohorts</span></h3>

      <p>A cohort that leaves your service on good terms is easier to recruit.
      You may maintain a network of such former cohorts, called contacts, equal
      to twice your practitioner ability modifier (minimum 2). Such contacts do
      not normally travel with you beyond reaching the nearest settlement. Each
      contact will have a place of residence, usually in a settlement but
      sometimes a wilderness area, ship, or other abode. You may send messages
      to a contact by whatever means you have available, requesting that they
      meet you at a particular time and place, allowing you to recruit them.
      Talents such a Messenger, and legendary talents such as Air Travel,
      Planisphere, and Teleportation can facilitate getting messages to the
      contact and their traveling to meet you. Contacts are able to travel to
      your caravan at the same rate as your Messengers.</p>

      <p>Contacts have lives apart from following you and may on occasion send
      requests for aid or show up in unexpected places. Unlike a cohort, there
      is no penalty for the death of a contact. Mindless cohorts may not become
      contacts.</p>

      <h3 id="toc6"><span>Roleplaying Cohorts</span></h3>

      <p>Cohorts are generally under the player's control regarding their
      mechanical actions, especially during adventures, but they are not
      mindless automatons. Cohorts that are abused or mistreated will abandon
      the player when able to do so. Normally, the GM will speak for cohorts.
      Another option is to allow other players to control some cohorts,
      investing them in the cohort's development and well-being. The other
      players could be allowed a degree of latitude to portray a unique
      personality for the cohort, emphasizing that it is a unique person rather
      than simply a class ability. This should obviously only be done after
      consulting with the other players and may not work in all groups. Be aware
      that this invites the others players' input on how the cohort is used,
      which may be unwelcome to some players.</p>

      <h2 id="toc7"><span>Follower Package</span></h2>

      <p>You gain a group of followers. These followers will not accompany you
      into dangerous locations, but can lend assistance in various ways.
      Followers can supply unskilled labor for simple tasks, such as clearing a
      road obstructed by falling rocks. Count the followers as supplying a
      number of Medium-sized unskilled laborers equal to half the number of
      followers in the settlement (or caravan). While doing so, the followers
      cannot provide their other benefits. If attacked, followers will attempt
      to flee to a safe place to the best of their ability. You normally have
      about 5 followers per rank in Diplomacy. If statistics are needed for a
      particular follower, treat them as level 1 commoners.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Alchemists, Craftsmen, Entertainers, Healers,
      Merchants, Rangers, or Scholars talents, then there is a 10% chance per
      talent that a randomly selected follower will be a level 1 expert. When
      you gain this package, choose a settlement with which you are well
      acquainted. Your initial followers are drawn from there. When first
      gaining this package, it is assumed that you have spent time in the past
      making contacts, deals, and promises and that you are well known enough in
      the community to attract a group of followers.</p>

      <p>Should the number of followers available be reduced for any reason, the
      effectiveness of (followers) talents is reduced, treating your ranks in
      Diplomacy as equal to the number of available followers/4. You normally
      regain 1 follower per rank in Diplomacy each day you spend in a settlement
      where your followers are dispersed, but you can double this number with 8
      hours of active effort each day. If you have lost all of your followers or
      do not disperse your followers in the settlement, the recruitment rate is
      halved (minimum 1 follower per day).</p>

      <p>If using the downtime rules found in Ultimate Campaign, having your
      followers present in a settlement increases the effect of Influence or
      Labor you spend by 50%, to a maximum of 1 additional Influence or Labor
      for every 2 followers in the settlement where the downtime activity takes
      place. Any talents that enable followers to make checks to generate
      capital receive any benefits from rooms and teams you have access to. If a
      talent allows followers to generate capital, the entire group of followers
      makes this check collectively. Any results that are not sufficient to
      generate capital on a given day may be carried over to the next day; this
      carrying-over may be continued until the result is sufficient to generate
      capital or your followers leave the settlement.</p>

      <p>If using the kingdom building rules found in Ultimate Campaign,
      possessing this package grants a +1 bonus to all kingdom attributes you
      affect.</p>
