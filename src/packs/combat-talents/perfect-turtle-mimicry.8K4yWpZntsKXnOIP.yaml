      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Shield sphere (Flexible Cover), base
      attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>While in this stance, choose one edge of your space. That edge is
      treated as cover as though using the Flexible Cover talent. This cover
      applies along the edge of your space even while moving, but the cover is
      always along the edge of your space you chose when assuming this stance.
      You must be wielding a shield to benefit from this stance.</p>

      <p>While in this stance, you may expend martial focus as an immediate
      action to gain improved cover against attacks from every direction until
      the start of your next turn (improved cover provides a +8 AC bonus and +4
      Reflex save bonus as well as improved evasion against attacks which this
      Reflex save bonus applies). When you lose the benefits of improved cover
      granted by this talent, you immediately exit this stance.</p>
