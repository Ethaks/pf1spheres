      "value": "<p>Your followers can disperse into a settlement, talking, listening, and influencing. Your followers can perform the following actions:</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Crowd:</strong> Your followers can spend 1d4 hours gathering a crowd. Make a Diplomacy skill check; the number of intelligent creatures in the crowd is equal to 10 times the result of the check. This multiplier increases by 10 at 5 ranks of Diplomacy and again every 5 ranks after (so times 20 at 5 ranks, times 30 and 10 ranks, etc.).</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Your followers spend 1d4 hours making a Gather Information check, using your modifiers. They may make an additional check simultaneously for every 5 ranks in Diplomacy you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Influence Crowd:</strong> Your followers encourage a crowd to be swayed by your words. When you make a skill check to influence a crowd, you automatically gain a +2 bonus from your follower&#8217;s use of the aid another action. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess.</p>\n<p><strong>Publicity:</strong> Your followers may spread good words about you, making a settlement more positively disposed toward you and your allies. The disposition of the average member of the settlement toward you increases by one step, to a maximum of friendly. This requires 1 day for a settlement of village size; double the time required for every size larger than village. For every 5 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess, the number of days required is reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1 day.</p>\n<p><strong>Whispers:</strong> If using the Rumors<sup>UI</sup> rules, you may have your followers participate in spreading a rumor, reducing the time required to start a rumor by 1 day, plus 1 day per 4 ranks in Diplomacy (to a minimum of 1 day). You automatically gain a +2 bonus from your follower&#8217;s use of the aid another action for all checks to start, spread, influence, or squash a rumor in a settlement where they are present.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you possess the (cohort) package, your followers may aid in recruitment, reducing the time required to recruit a cohort to 1d4 hours, -1 hour for every 6 ranks of Diplomacy you possess (minimum 1 hour required).</p>\n<p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers reduce the influence cost of promoting your business or recruiting for an organization in a settlement that they are present in by 1, +1 per 4 ranks in Diplomacy.</p>\n",
