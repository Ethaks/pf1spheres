      <p>The first time you make a successful disarm or sunder attempt in a
      round using an attack action with an unarmed strike, you can make an
      additional disarm or sunder attempt as a free action which does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity. Also as long as you have martial focus,
      your unarmed strikes gain the sunder and disarm weapon special
      properties.</p>
