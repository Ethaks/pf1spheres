      <p>While in this stance, you may occupy the same square(s) as your animal
      allies at no penalty. Whenever you occupy the same square as an animal
      ally during this stance, you may expend an attack of opportunity to change
      the target of an attack targeting that animal ally to you as a free action
      that can be taken even outside your normal turn. Additionally, animal
      allies who occupy the same square as you in this manner may substitute
      your base attack bonus for their own, up to their number of Hit Dice, as
      long as the stance lasts.</p>
