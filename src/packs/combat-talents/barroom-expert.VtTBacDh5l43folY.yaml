      <p>You may treat an improvised weapon as though it had one of the
      following special features (chosen upon first picking up an improvised
      weapon and may be changed once per round as a free action): blocking,
      brace, deadly, disarm, distracting, double (this may not be applied to
      improvised light weapons), grapple, nonlethal, performance, reach (this
      may only be applied to two handed improvised weapons), sunder, or trip. If
      the GM chooses, he may pose reasonable limitations on which items can gain
      which special features (for example, a sack of flour wouldn&#8217;t have
      reach, while a sandwich wouldn&#8217;t have deadly).</p>

      <p>In addition, the improvised weapon has its damage increased by 1 size
      category and has its critical threat range increased to 19&#8211;20, with
      a critical multiplier of &#215;2. At +10 base attack bonus, improvised
      weapons have their critical threat range increased to 18-20 and you may
      apply two of the listed special features to improvised weapons.
