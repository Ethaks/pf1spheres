      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Equipment sphere.</p>

      <p>While wearing heavy armor you may treat your gauntlets and any armor
      spikes as though they had an enhancement bonus equal to the armor&#8217;s
      enhancement bonus to AC. Gauntlets and armor spikes benefiting from this
      talent do not gain the benefits of any enhancement bonus or special
      properties they would normally possess.</p>
