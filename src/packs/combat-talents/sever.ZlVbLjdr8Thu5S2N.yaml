      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere, base attack bonus
      +11.</p>

      <p>When your natural dice roll for a disarm attempt falls within your
      weapon&#8217;s natural critical threat range (for example, when you roll a
      natural 18, 19, or 20 while attempting to disarm a creature with a
      rapier), you can choose to expend your martial focus as an immediate
      action; the target must pass a Reflex save or have one hand used to wield
      the weapon severed. Abilities such as the keen weapon enhancement or the
      Improved Critical feat do not modify the threat range for this ability.
      The target takes 1d6 points of bleed damage from the wound, +1d6 for every
      4 points of base attack bonus you possess; this stacks with bleed damage
      granted by the Duelist sphere&#8217;s blooded strike.</p>

      <p>With the exception of the bleed damage (which may be stopped as
      normal), there are many permanent penalties associated with losing a hand
      that can only be removed by a spell capable of restoring the severed limb,
      such as a regeneration or restoration spell, natural regeneration, or the
      Regeneration advanced talent from the Life sphere. These include:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>-5 penalty on Climb, Craft, Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, and Use
      Magic Device skill checks;</li>

      <li>-4 penalty on grapple checks;</li>

      <li>Must make a caster level check to cast spells with somatic
      components;</li>

      <li>Unable to wield two-handed weapons, make two-weapon attacks, or wield
      a tool in the missing hand, but may still wear a shield on the affected
      arm;</li>

      <li>Carrying capacity is not reduced. However, the maximum weight a
      character can lift over head or off the ground is reduced by one
      third.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A character who has lost both hands, or one hand and one arm, cannot
      use any of the listed skills, make attacks, cast spells with somatic
      components, or handle objects, without the aid of prosthetics or magic. A
      severed hand counts as an object three size categories smaller than the
      creature it came from.</p>
