      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dual Wielding sphere, Three-Sword
      Style, base attack bonus +16.</p>

      <p>When making a dual attack, you may expend your martial focus and forego
      any extra attacks that you might otherwise be able to make during your
      turn to treat each attack as an attack action. This means that each of the
      three attacks may be modified by feats such as Vital Strike, but cannot
      trigger any additional attacks, such as combat maneuvers added by talents
      when making an attack action normally.</p>
