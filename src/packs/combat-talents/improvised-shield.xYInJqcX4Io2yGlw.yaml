      <p>As a free action, you may wield an improvised weapon as an improvised
      shield for a round. When wielded as an improvised shield, the
      weapon&#8217;s damage die is decreased by 2 sizes, and the weapon grants a
      shield bonus: light weapons grant +1 shield bonus, one-handed weapons
      grant a +2 shield bonus, and two-handed weapons grant a +4 shield bonus.
      Just as with all shields, you lose this shield bonus to AC if you use the
      improvised shield to attack, unless you possess the ability to make shield
      bashes without sacrificing shield bonus. An improvised shield counts as a
      regular shield for the Shield sphere.</p>

      <p>Whenever you are wielding a shield with the fragile special feature and
      a target scores a critical hit against you, you may break your shield to
      change the critical hit into a normal hit.</p>
