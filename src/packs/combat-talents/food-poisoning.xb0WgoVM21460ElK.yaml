      <p>The effects of your ingested poisons last for 24 hours in addition to
      its normal duration (this extra duration is still doubled by the Potent
      Poison talent). For every 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess, your
      ingested poisons last for another 24 hours (also doubled by the Potent
      Poison talent). In addition, if a target is affected by an ingested poison
      with further effects on consecutive failed saves, it must attempt an
      additional save against that poison at the beginning of each 24 hour
      period in which its affected by the poison: A successful save does not end
      the poison&#8217;s effect, but a failed save causes a new effect as normal
      for that poison which lasts for the remaining duration of this poison. The
      first of these additional saves happens after the unmodified duration of
      the poison (normally 1 minute).</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This talent increases the duration of a
      (toxin)'s negative effects, not any effect of a (toxin).</p>
