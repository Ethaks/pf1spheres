    value: >
      <p>A creature that fails its Reflex save to avoid a noose snare may not
      move from its current location and is unable to breathe unless it succeeds
      on a Strength or Escape Artist check against the trap&#8217;s DC or
      destroys the trap via damage. For every 4 ranks in Craft (traps) you
      possess, an affected creature is treated as though an additional round
      passed each round it remains in the snare for the purposes of how long
      they can hold their breath. Additionally, any spell the creature attempts
      to cast suffers a 50% spell failure chance if it requires verbal
      components.</p>
