      <p>You can fluidly mount and dismount, transitioning from mounted to
      unmounted combat with ease.</p>

      <p>You gain the following abilities:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Leaping Charge:</strong> You may use the leaping dismount
      ability granted by this talent during a mounted charge attack. If you move
      at least 10 feet towards the target of your charge attack using leaping
      dismount, the bonus on attack rolls made at the end of a charge and the
      penalty to your AC after performing a charge attack both increase by +1 +
      1 per 5 ranks of Ride you possess. You are still considered mounted for
      this charge attack for the purposes of lance damage, mounted combat feats,
      and other abilities or effects. You may use leaping dismount to move into
      any unoccupied space within reach of the target of your charge, even if it
      would not be the closest square for a charge.</li>

      <li><strong>Leaping Dismount:</strong> Whenever you dismount your mount
      (normally a move action, or as a free action with a successful fast
      dismount), instead of dismounting into a square adjacent to your mount,
      you may spend an immediate action to jump, moving in any direction up to
      10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 ranks in Ride you possess (without needing to
      attempt an Acrobatics check to jump). Leaping dismount&#8217;s movement
      provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</li>

      <li><strong>Skilled Mount and Dismount:</strong> You can attempt Ride
      checks to fast mount or fast dismount your mount even if your mount is
      more than one size category larger than you. You may take 10 on Ride
      checks to fast mount or fast dismount, even if rushed or threatened.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The leaping charge ability granted by this
      talent allows you to perform a charge attack against a target further than
      your mount&#8217;s movement provided you move into an empty space within
      reach of your target with leaping dismount.</p>
