      "value": "<p>Your followers includes crafters who can repair broken weapons, armor, and other non-magical items while you rest. The followers can remove the broken condition from and restore to full hit points to one non-magic weapon, shield, suit of armor, or other object of no greater than large size during an eight-hour rest. If repairing an object larger than this maximum size, the amount of hit points restored is halved for every size category the object is above the maximum. The followers can repair an additional item for every 3 ranks in Diplomacy you possess. You may choose to count a Huge object as two Large objects, a Gargantuan object as two Huge objects, etc.</p>\n<p>At 5 ranks of Diplomacy, the followers can repair magical items with a caster level no greater than your ranks in Diplomacy; each such item counts as two items for determining the number of items that may be repaired at one time. A Huge magic item would count as 4 items, a Gargantuan magic item as 8 items, etc.</p>\n<p>In place of repairing an item, the followers can craft a non-magical item, requiring that you pay the normal crafting cost. The caravan makes 10 gp of progress per rank in Diplomacy per day and can craft masterwork items.</p>\n<p>If you possess the Merchants talent, non-magical weapons, armor, and ammunition purchased from the followers have their cost reduced by half.</p>\n<p>Any Craft checks made to craft non-magical, non-alchemical items (such as, but not limited to weapons, armor, shields, and ammunition) made while with the followers automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus from the crafters&#8217; aid. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess.</p>\n<p>If you possess the (cohort) package, your cohorts possess masterwork weapons and armor.</p>\n<p>If using the downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may generate Goods capital in place of earning gold, with 10 gp equaling 1 Good. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>\n",
