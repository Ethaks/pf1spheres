      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (cohort) package.</p>\n<p>You may recruit cohorts with the undead type, finding and reanimating dead bodies with arcane rituals. Such cohorts are built normally, including racial selection, but have the undead type, and gain +1 natural armor and either DR 5/bludgeoning or DR 5/slashing. Such cohorts are mindless, gaining no skill points, and must have the warrior or woodsman profession. Mindless cohorts still gain skill ranks from spheres that grant them and may use these skills normally. They do not gain feats, but may take a combat talent any time they would have gained a feat. As undead, the cohort have no Constitution score (Con (-)) and determine their hit points using their Charisma score. Any creature or a race normally suitable to be a cohort may be recruited when using this ability and you may choose the number of Hit Dice the reanimated creature has. Mindless cohorts of the undead type will obey harmful and even suicidal orders. You take no penalties to your recruit checks for the destruction of undead cohorts. No Diplomacy check is required to recruit creatures in this way.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent a second time; doing so allows you to create undead cohorts with their normal Intelligence scores, gaining feats and skills normally. These cohorts may be of any profession.</p>\n",
