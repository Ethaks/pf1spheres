    value: >
      <p>Your attack cuts into the target&#8217;s face, impeding their ability
      to see and hear. The target treats all targets as if they had partial
      concealment (a 20% miss chance) for 1 round, and suffers a -2 Penalty to
      all Perception checks. For every 5 points of base attack bonus you
      possess, this penalty lasts an additional round.</p>
