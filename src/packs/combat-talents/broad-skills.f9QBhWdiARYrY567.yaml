      <p>You may tame creatures of animal intelligence (Intelligence scores of 1
      or 2) of any type, though you take a -4 penalty on the check on creatures
      not of the animal type. Only permanent Intelligence counts for determining
      if a creature can be affected; ability drain, damage, or other penalties
      or effects that reduce Intelligence to not allow a creature to be
      affected. You may also tame mindless creatures of the ooze, plant, or
      vermin type, bypassing any immunity to mind-affecting effects granted by
      the their type. Mindless creatures serving you as a mount count as animal
      allies. Creatures not of the animal type count as twice their Hit Dice
      against the total amount you may have tame at once. This increase does not
      stack with the increase for creatures with the swarm subtype from the
      Beekeeper talent.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Animal Empathy talent, it is likewise expanded with
      the same penalty.</p>
