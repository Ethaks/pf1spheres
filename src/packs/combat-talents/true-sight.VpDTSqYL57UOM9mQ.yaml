      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scout sphere, Discern Illusions,
      Piercing Eye, Perception 15 ranks.</p>

      <p>So long as you have martial focus, your razor sharp senses can no
      longer be fooled by illusions and misdirections, granting you the ability
      to see all things as they actually are. This functions as the true seeing
      spell but is a personal, extraordinary effect that allows you to see
      through normal and magical darkness, notice secret doors hidden by magic,
      see the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or displacement
      effects, see invisible creatures or objects normally, see through
      illusions, and see the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted
      things. Further, you can focus your vision to see into the Ethereal Plane
      (but not into extradimensional spaces). The range of this effect is 120
      feet.</p>

      <p>This ability does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers
      x-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including
      that caused by fog and the like. True Sight does not help you see through
      mundane disguises, spot creatures who are simply hiding, or notice secret
      doors hidden by mundane means. In addition, this effect cannot be further
      enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use this ability through a
      crystal ball or in conjunction with clairaudience/clairvoyance.</p>
