    value: >
      <p>A creature that fails its Reflex save to avoid this snare is treated as
      if it was successfully affected by a feint. This counts as you performing
      the feint for the purposes of Fencing sphere talents that depend on
      feinting a target. Non-humanoids with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 get
      a +4 bonus to Reflex saves against this trap and mindless creatures are
      still immune. If you possess the Unlikely Feint Fencing sphere talent,
      reduce the bonus to saves non-humanoids with an Intelligence score of 1 or
      2 get to their saves to +2 and mindless creatures are vulnerable to this
      trap but gain a +4 bonus to their Reflex save.</p>
