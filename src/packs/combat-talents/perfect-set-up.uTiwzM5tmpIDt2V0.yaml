      <p>As long as you have martial focus, as part of an attack action you may
      make a touch attack with your main-hand weapon which deals only the
      weapon&#8217;s damage die. If this attack is successful, the next attack
      you make with your off-hand weapon gains a +2 bonus to its damage roll and
      targets the creature&#8217;s flat-footed AC (the target is not actually
      flat-footed for this attack), ignoring cover or concealment as long as
      that attack is made before the end of your next round. For every 4 points
      of base attack bonus you possess, this bonus damage increases by +2.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Perfect Set-Up replaces the main-hand
      attack action with an attack which deals only your weapon's base damage
      dice. This attack is no longer treated as an attack action and cannot be
      modified by other effects such as Vital Strike or various attack action
      modifiers from other spheres (Duelist's blooded strike, Fencing's fatal
      thrust, etc.).</p>
