      <p>Your acute senses have been trained to their peak, making you difficult
      to catch unaware even while sleeping. You no longer increase the DC of
      Perception checks made while you are sleeping, and falling unconscious or
      going to sleep no longer causes you to lose martial focus. In addition,
      you are no longer considered helpless while sleeping as your heightened
      senses allow you to react to threats your conscious mind is unaware of.
      You may take this talent a second time; the second time you take this
      talent, you no longer suffer most negative limitations of being asleep;
      this is functionally similar to immunity to sleep, though rather than
      staying awake when targeted by a sleep affect your subconscious mind and
      instincts simply take over, allowing you to continue fighting unimpeded,
      though you still cannot perform any Charisma, Dexterity, or
      Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride)
      or any ability that requires patience or concentration.</p>
