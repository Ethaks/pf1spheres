      <p>When used with a dart trap, a creature that is struck by your dart must
      make a Reflex save or become entangled. You may forgo damage to resolve
      this attack against touch AC. This condition lasts until the creature
      succeeds on a Strength or Escape Artist check against the trap&#8217;s DC
      or destroys the trap via damage.</p>

      <p>When used with a snare trap, the target is entangled and unable to move
      from the triggering square until it succeeds on a Strength or Escape
      Artist check against the trap&#8217;s DC or destroys the trap via
      damage.</p>
