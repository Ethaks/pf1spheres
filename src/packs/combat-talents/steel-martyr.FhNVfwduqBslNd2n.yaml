      <p>Whenever a critical hit is scored against you, as an immediate action
      you may divert the additional damage from the critical hit to your armor.
      This action is taken after the result of the attack roll is known but
      before the damage is revealed. You suffer any damage in excess of your
      armor&#8217;s hit points.</p>
