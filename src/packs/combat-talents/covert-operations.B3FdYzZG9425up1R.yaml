      <p>Allies within range of this tactic are granted a +3 competence bonus on
      Acrobatics, Escape Artist, and Stealth checks, increasing by +1 for every
      4 ranks in Diplomacy you possess. Allies benefiting from this tactic may
      use the Acrobatics skill to move through threatened squares at full speed
      without penalty. Allies can benefit from your Covert Operations tactic
      even if they cannot see you.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice. If taken a second time, allies
      benefiting from this tactic may, when using the Stealth skill, move up to
      their normal speed without the usual penalty. Additionally, attacks
      against allies with nonmagical concealment (such as dim light or terrain)
      benefiting from this tactic have a 30% miss chance instead of the normal
      20%, increasing by 5% for every 4 ranks in Diplomacy you possess, to a
      maximum of 50% miss chance. This tactic does not grant total concealment;
      it just increases the miss chance.</p>
