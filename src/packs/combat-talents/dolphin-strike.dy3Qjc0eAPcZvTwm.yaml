      <p>If you have the (leap) package, whenever you perform an Acrobatics
      check to attempt a high jump as part of a move action and the movement
      from this jump would allow you to threaten a creature at a higher
      elevation with a melee weapon, you may perform an attack action with that
      weapon as a standard action against the creature. This attack deals an
      extra 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of maximum vertical height allowed
      by the Acrobatics check, up to a maximum of 1d6 per rank in Acrobatics you
      possess. A creature damaged this way cannot perform attacks of opportunity
      against you for leaving threatened squares until the end of your turn.</p>

      <p>If you have the (swim) package, as part of a move action underwater you
      may perform a high jump to break the surface of the water by using your
      Swim ranks and modifier instead of your Acrobatics ranks and modifier.
      Otherwise it is the same as above.</p>
