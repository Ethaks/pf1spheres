      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 15</p>

      <p>You create a flask of acid that functions as a splash weapon you can
      use as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 ft., dealing 1d6
      acid damage +1d6 per two Craft (alchemy) ranks you possess to the target
      of a direct hit, half that damage to targets 5 ft. away from the point of
      contact, and 1 point of acid splash damage per die of damage this weapon
      deals on a direct hit to targets 10 ft. away from the point of contact (to
      a maximum of half the damage dealt to the primary target). Targets who
      take at least 2 points of acid damage from the initial attack take half
      the total damage again on the following round.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each
      time you do so, the range for each damage increment increases by 5 ft.
      (for example, if you increase the Craft DC to 25, you would deal full
      damage to all targets within 5 ft. of the point of contact, half damage to
      all targets 10 ft. away from the point of contact, and 1 point of damage
      to all creatures within 15 ft.).</p>
