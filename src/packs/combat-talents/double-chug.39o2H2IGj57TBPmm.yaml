    value: >
      <p>As a move action, you can draw and drink two non-magical alcoholic
      drinks or one magical drink and one non-magical drink; doing so doubles
      the duration of the drunk status and grants you a +1 circumstance bonus on
      all saving throws while drunk. You must have two open hands in order to
      perform a double chug. At +10 base attack bonus, performing a double chug
      lets you expend your drunk status twice before actually losing it.</p>
