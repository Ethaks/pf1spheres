      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you can catch thrown or falling
      rocks (or projectiles of similar shape) that are no larger than your
      current size. Once per round, when you would normally be hit by a rock,
      you can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 25 for
      a rock of your current size, -5 for each size category it is smaller than
      you. If the projectile has a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC
      increases by that amount. You must be aware of the attack in order to make
      a rock catching attempt.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you are considered proficient with thrown rocks. You can
      hurl rocks of up to two size categories smaller than you. A
      &#8220;rock&#8221; is any large, bulky, and relatively regularly shaped
      object made of any material with a hardness of at least 5.</p>

      <p>You can hurl the rock as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10
      ft. +10 per size category it is smaller than you. Tiny rocks deal 1d6
      bludgeoning damage, Small 1d8, Medium 2d6, and Large 3d6. As long as you
      have martial focus and a suitable rock is within your reach, you may pick
      them up as part of your attack. At +7 and +14 base attack bonus, increase
      the maximum size rock you may throw by one size category, to a maximum
      equal to your current size.</p>
