      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Leadership sphere.</p>

      <p>You can recruit cohorts from the outer planes themselves. Such cohorts
      are built like a normal cohort, but are Small or Medium creatures with the
      outsider (extraplanar) type, and benefits from the Conjuration sphere
      Planar Creature (type) talent as if it were a Conjuration companion. As
      you recruit by calling on creatures from other planes, you don&#8217;t
      actually have to be at a settlement in order to recruit cohorts this way.
      You treat this as if recruiting from a metropolis and the population is
      always at least 50% of the particular race you are seeking.</p>
