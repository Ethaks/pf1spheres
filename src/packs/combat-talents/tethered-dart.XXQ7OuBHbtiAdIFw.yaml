    value: >
      <p>A creature that is struck by your dart must succeed at a Reflex save or
      be tethered to the corner chosen when placing a dart, and is subject to a
      drag combat maneuver, using your practitioner modifier and Craft (traps)
      ranks instead of your Strength and base attack bonus respectively,
      dragging them towards the corner&#8217;s square. Each round the target
      remains tethered, they are subjected to the same drag combat maneuver
      (attempting a new roll every time). The tether has 10 hit points plus 2
      hit points per rank in Craft (traps) you possess, an AC of 5, hardness
      equal to 1/2 your ranks in Craft (ranks), and a Break DC equal to your
      Trap sphere DC. The target cannot move further away from the trap without
      first breaking the tether or succeeding at a drag or reposition combat
      maneuver against your Trap sphere DC + 5, pulling the trap along with
      them. If you possess the Trap Wielder talent, you can instead have the
      tether applied to yourself instead of a designated corner.</p>
