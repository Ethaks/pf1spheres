      <p>Whenever an improvised weapon you wield would be destroyed, you may
      instead break it evenly into two new improvised weapons, each 1 size
      smaller than the original improvised weapon which was destroyed. This
      talent fails if the new improvised weapons would be Tiny or smaller. You
      may still allow a weapon to be destroyed normally.</p>
