    value: >
      <p>Whenever you use an attack action and successfully strike a single
      creature with both your main-hand and off-hand weapons before the start of
      your next turn, that creature gains the battered condition and takes a -2
      penalty on all attacks of opportunity they make until the end of your next
      turn. At +10 base attack bonus, this talent&#8217;s effects last for an
      additional round and the penalty on attacks of opportunity increases to
      -3.</p>
