    value: >
      <p>Whenever you make an attack action or an attack of opportunity against
      a target that is within 30 ft. and that you are flanking, that is
      flat-footed, or that has lost its Dexterity bonus to AC (such as through a
      successful feint), you deal an additional +1d6 precision damage to the
      target. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. This damage
      increases by an additional 1d6 precision damage for every 5 points of base
      attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p>A fencer may apply the effects of a single (exploit) talent to any
      fatal thrust.</p>
