      <p>You channel the basilisk, wrapping yourself in virulent toxins.</p>

      <p>As part of entering this stance, you must expend one Alchemy sphere
      poison. If you expend your martial focus as part of activating this stance
      to extend this stance&#8217;s duration, you may create one Alchemy sphere
      poison as part of the same action used to activate this stance (expending
      the poison for the stance&#8217;s normal effects). A poison expended to
      enter this stance lasts for the stance&#8217;s duration.</p>

      <p>While in this stance, any other creature that begins its turn within
      your natural reach or attacks you with a melee attack must attempt a
      saving throw against the expended poison used to enter this stance. In
      addition, whenever you successfully attack a creature you have poisoned
      with the Alchemy sphere, that creature takes a -2 penalty on their next
      saving throw against your Alchemy sphere poisons made within the next
      minute.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The penalty from this talent does not
      stack with itself, as it is a penalty from the same source.</p>
