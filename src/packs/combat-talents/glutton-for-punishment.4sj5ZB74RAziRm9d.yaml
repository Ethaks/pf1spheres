      <p>As long as your delayed damage pool is at maximum capacity, you gain
      DR/&#8211; equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus.</p>

      <p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever you redirect damage dealt
      by another creature to your delayed damage pool, you may scream out in
      pain and attempt an Intimidate check against that creature to demoralize
      them as an immediate action.</p>
