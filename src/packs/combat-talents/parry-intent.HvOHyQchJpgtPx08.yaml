      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Bluff ranks 10, Fencing sphere (Parry
      And Riposte), base attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>Whenever you would use your Parry And Riposte talent against an
      appropriate attack (including the expanded options granted by Parry
      Anything, except area-based effects), you may attempt a Bluff check
      instead of an attack roll. If your Bluff check is greater than the attack,
      the creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (using your ranks in
      Bluff instead of your base attack bonus) or change the target of the
      relevant attack from you to another creature of your choice, even if it is
      one of their allies. On a successful save, the attack targets you as
      normal. This is a supernatural mind-affecting compulsion effect.</p>
