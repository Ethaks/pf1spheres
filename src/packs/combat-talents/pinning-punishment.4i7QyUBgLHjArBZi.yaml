    value: >
      <p>When striking a target twice with the same barrage, that creature must
      make a successful Reflex save or have all movement speeds they possess
      reduced to 0. This only works when using arrows, bolts, or other similar
      ammunition, and does not affect creatures that are not adjacent to the
      floor, a wall, or another solid object which they could be pinned to. The
      creature cannot move while affected in this way, unless they spend a
      standard action to remove the arrows first, or else break them through
      sundering or in some other fashion. The creature may attempt to simply rip
      themselves free as part of a move action made to move by passing a
      Strength or Escape Artist check with a DC equal to your Barrage DC, and
      the target gains 1d6 bleed.</p>
