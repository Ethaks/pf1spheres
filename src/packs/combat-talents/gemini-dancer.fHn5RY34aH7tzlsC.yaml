      <p>At the start of your turn, you can spend a swift action to use this
      talent. When you do, until the beginning of your next turn whenever you
      use the dual attack ability, if your attacks with your main hand or off
      hand weapon miss due to not hitting the creature&#8217;s armor class, as
      long as your attack was within 5 points of the creature&#8217;s armor
      class (if the creature&#8217;s AC was 25, this talent would trigger if
      your attack roll was 24 to 20), you still deal damage as though you had
      rolled the minimum result for the attack (if you miss with your off-hand
      attack which would normally deal 1d6+2 damage, you would still deal 3
      damage); this talent is treated as dealing damage for abilities which rely
      on doing so, such as sneak attack. At +10 base attack bonus, you instead
      roll damage normally for this talent, dealing half of the damage it would
      have dealt. If you expend your martial focus while activating this talent,
      it instead lasts a number of rounds equal to your practitioner
      modifier.</p>
