      <p>While wielding a firearm, you can still make unarmed strikes with the
      hands used to wield it (these attacks do not provoke attacks of
      opportunity if you are not proficient with unarmed strikes); if you do,
      your unarmed strikes made with any hand wielding a firearm gain any
      enhancement bonuses to attack or damage rolls your firearm possesses (this
      bonus cannot exceed +5). When using the attack action to make a successful
      attack with your unarmed strike against a creature, or when you succeed at
      a melee attack with a double weapon that is part melee weapon and part
      firearm (such as the axe musket or dagger pistol) using the attack action,
      as a swift action you can make a ranged attack with a -2 penalty against
      the same creature with your firearm or the firearm portion of your weapon;
      this attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
