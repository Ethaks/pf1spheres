    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully use the attack action to strike a creature
      with your main-hand weapon, the critical threat range of your off-hand
      weapon increases by 1 (this stacks with other effects which would increase
      your critical threat range, but is applied last) until the beginning of
      your next turn. When your base attack bonus is +10 or higher, your
      off-hand weapon&#8217;s critical threat range instead increases by 2.</p>
