      "value": "<p>You gain a familiar as the wizard class feature with an effective arcane spellcaster level equal to the highest between your base attack bonus or your ranks in Handle Animal. A familiar chosen with this talent must have the animal type and retains the animal type rather than becoming a magical beast, and does not gain an Intelligence bonus or the deliver touch spells, scry on familiar, share spells, speak with animals of its kind, or spell resistance special abilities. This familiar always counts as an animal ally.</p>\n<p>If you possess the Broad Skills talent, you may instead choose any familiar ordinarily available from the wizard class feature (such as familiar options with the construct, plant, or vermin type).</p>\n<p>If this familiar is dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later at no cost.</p>\n<p>Abilities that grant talents temporarily can not be used to gain this talent, such as taking the Extra Combat Talent feat with martial flexibility or gaining it from an armiger&#8217;s customized weapon.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Familiar Bond.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you already possess a familiar, or gain one at a later time from another source, you may choose to have your effective arcane caster level from this talent stack with those from other sources, to a maximum of your character level. If you do, you may choose to have your familiar gain all the normal benefits of being a familiar, as the wizard&#8217;s arcane bond option (including type, Intelligence bonus, and special abilities), but doing so incurs the normal replacement cost should your familiar die. If the ability which grants you a familiar loses any of the normal benefits of being a familiar, your familiar does not gain that ability.</p>\n",
