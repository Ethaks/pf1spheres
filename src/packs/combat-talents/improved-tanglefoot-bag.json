      "value": "<p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>\n<p>You create a single use bag that can be thrown at a creature as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 ft.; on a successful attack, the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a &#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls and a &#8211;4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. Improved tanglefoot bags do not function underwater.</p>\n<p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a Strength check or by dealing 20 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell with a somatic component, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell&#8217;s level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 3d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness; any penalties imposed by this effect end at that time as well. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</p>\n<p>You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; the first time you do so, all creatures within 5 ft. of the original target must make a Reflex save or suffer the effects of having been hit by an improved tanglefoot bag. For every additional 10 by which you increase the DC, the radius of this effect increases by an additional 5 ft.</p>\n",
