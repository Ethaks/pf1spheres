      <p>As a swift action, you may attempt to snag a target as a melee touch
      attack, latching onto part of their clothing, armor, or flesh and making
      them battered. If you are already holding a target, such as via the Scale
      Foe Athletics talent or via a successful grapple, they are also considered
      battered as long as the hold persists. If you do not grapple an opponent
      or perform a similar technique such as Scale Foe by the end of your turn,
      the snag automatically ends.</p>

      <p><strong>Slam:</strong> Any time you initiate or maintain a grapple, you
      may apply 1 (slam) talent as an immediate action in addition to the normal
      benefits of initiating or maintaining a grapple.</p>
