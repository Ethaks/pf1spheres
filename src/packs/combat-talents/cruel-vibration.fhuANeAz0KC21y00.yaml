    value: >
      <p>Whenever you use an attack action to deal damage to a creature with the
      weapon currently being used to impale them, your damage is treated as
      though you rolled the maximum possible amount on your weapon&#8217;s
      damage dice (additional damage dice from critical hits and special
      abilities such as the flaming enchantment are not affected by this
      ability). At +10 base attack bonus, whenever you deal damage with a weapon
      currently impaling a creature, that creature must make a successful
      Fortitude save or be unable to take a move action for 1 round.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Cruel Vibration does not affect
      additional damage dice from Vital Strike.</sup></p>
