      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Shield sphere (Cover Ally), base attack
      bonus +5.</p>

      <p>As a swift action, you may choose a creature or 5-foot square that you
      can see within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 points of base attack
      bonus you possess), guarding the location with an aspect of yourself until
      the beginning of your next turn; if you choose a creature, the aspect
      moves with them.</p>

      <p>You are treated as if you were standing in the same square as your
      aspect when determining the effects of your Shield sphere talents,
      including when using active defense.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Extensive Defense talent, you may expend your
      martial focus when creating an aspect to allow the aspect to last for a
      number of rounds equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 2
      rounds).</p>

      <p>This talent is a supernatural effect.</p>
