    value: >
      <p>You gain a competence bonus to Survival checks made to find and follow
      tracks equal to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum +1). When
      successfully following a set of tracks no older than 1 hour per rank in
      Stealth you possess (minimum 1 hour), you learn not only what direction
      they headed but what actions the tracked targets took before leaving the
      area and during their movement as long as you successfully continue to
      follow their trail; information gained in this manner is typically quite
      general, such as whether the targets paused and ate, split up, had an
      altercation, etc. Detailed information such as what spells they may have
      cast or items they may have used is typically unavailable, unless the
      targets left some tangible indication of the act behind, such as an empty
      potion bottle.</p>
