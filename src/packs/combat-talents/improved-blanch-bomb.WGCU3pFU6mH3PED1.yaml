      <p>You create a single use bag of fine metallic powder you can throw as a
      ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet that drastically
      deteriorates the defenses&#8212;both manufactured and natural&#8212;of
      those affected. Anyone standing on the square of impact or in adjacent
      squares must attempt a Fortitude save; targets 10 feet away must also
      succeed a Fortitude save but gain a +5 circumstance bonus. Creatures who
      are immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (such as
      constructs and undead) are not immune to the effects of this formulae.</p>

      <p>Creatures that fail the save have a specific form of damage reduction
      reduced by 2 + 1 per 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy) for 1 minute, or until
      they wash the powder off (which ends the effect). While a creature may
      have multiple types of damage resistance reduced with different blanch
      bombs, multiple applications of this formulae (even from multiple sources)
      to reduce a specific type of damage reduction do not stack, only the most
      potent applies. You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments
      of 10; each time you do so, the area of effect increases by 5 ft., and all
      saving throw DCs increase by +2.</p>

      <p>The types of damage reduction that may be reduced are determined by the
      Craft DC used for its creation:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>DC 20:</strong> damage reduction/magic</li>

      <li><strong>DC 25:</strong> damage reduction/cold iron or damage
      reduction/silver (chosen at the time of creation)</li>

      <li><strong>DC 30:</strong> damage reduction/adamantine</li>

      <li><strong>DC 35:</strong> damage reduction/alignment-based (chosen at
      the time of creation)</li>

      </ul>
