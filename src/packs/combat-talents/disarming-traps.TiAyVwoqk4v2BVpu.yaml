      <p>A creature that fails its Reflex save to avoid this snare is subject to
      a disarm maneuver as if the trap successfully beat their CMD. This counts
      as you performing the disarm maneuver for the purposes of Duelist sphere
      abilities that depend on you triggering the disarm. Creatures targeted by
      this trap get a +1 circumstance bonus on their saving throw for each size
      category they are larger than Medium.</p>
