      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere (formulae) package,
      Craft (alchemy) 20 ranks</p>

      <p>Once per month with one day of work, you may create a
      philosopher&#8217;s stone.</p>

      <p>A philosopher&#8217;s stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of
      blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is
      revealed at the stone&#8217;s heart. This cavity is lined with a magical
      type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in
      Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and
      gold. A single philosopher&#8217;s stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of
      iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into
      gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the
      stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all
      transmutations must take place within that period.</p>

      <p>The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to
      another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still
      potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection
      spell or Greater Resurrection sphere effect (if using Spheres of Power)
      for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.</p>
