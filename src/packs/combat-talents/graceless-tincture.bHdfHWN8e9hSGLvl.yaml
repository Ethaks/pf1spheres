      <p>Instead of becoming fatigued, the target suffers a -5 penalty on Sense
      Motive checks, and reduces the DC to influence its attitude with Diplomacy
      or Intimidate checks by 5. When creating a graceless tincture, the
      duration is increased from 1 minute to 1 day. For every 4 ranks in Craft
      (alchemy) you possess, the penalty to Sense Motive checks increases by 3
      and the DC to influence the creature is reduced by 1.</p>
