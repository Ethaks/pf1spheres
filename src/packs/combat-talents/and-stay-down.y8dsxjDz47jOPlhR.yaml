    value: >
      <p>Whenever a creature lands prone in a square you threaten, you may make
      an attack of opportunity against them, dealing 1 additional point of bleed
      damage (this stacks with other bleed damage granted by the base ability of
      the Duelist sphere); this attack of opportunity considers &#8220;whenever
      a creature lands prone&#8221; and &#8220;whenever you succeed on a trip
      combat maneuver&#8221; to be part of the same trigger, and you cannot take
      more than one attack of opportunity due to this circumstance. If
      successful, the target of this attack must make a successful Acrobatics
      check to stand up as their blood slicks the ground beneath them. If the
      target is suffering from your blooded strike&#8217;s bleed damage, they
      suffer a penalty to their Acrobatics check equal to the bleed damage.
      Targets immune to bleed damage do not need to make an Acrobatics
      check.</p>
