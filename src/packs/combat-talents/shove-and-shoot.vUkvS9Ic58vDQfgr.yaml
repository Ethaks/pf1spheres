      <p>When you make a barrage special attack action, you may forgo making
      your first ranged attack and instead make a Bull Rush combat maneuver as a
      free action against a creature within your natural reach. This does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity. Your barrage penalty to attack rolls
      also applies to your CMB with this combat maneuver. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Stabbing Shot.</p>
