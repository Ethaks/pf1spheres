      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Boxing sphere, counter punch ability,
      Diplomacy or Intimidate or Bluff 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>Your comebacks are so potent they can literally cause targets pain. You
      may ready the demoralization action from the Intimidate skill, a shout
      from the Warleader sphere that affects enemies, or (if you possess Verbal
      Feint from the Fencing sphere) a feint, as if they were counter punches.
      If successful, one afflicted target of your choice within 30 ft. of you
      suffers twice the bonus damage from your counter punch as nonlethal damage
      in addition to the effects of the readied action itself. This is a
      language-based, mind-altering effect.</p>
