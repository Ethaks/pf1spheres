      "value": "<p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 15<br>\nYou gain the knowledge of two types of war paint when you gain this talent; you may create any one type of war paint you know, chosen at the time the formulae is crafted.</p>\n<p>There are eleven common variations of war paint, each providing a specific benefit to aid their hunters, warriors, and heroes in a variety of tasks. War paint can be applied to any visible part of the body &#8212; typically the face, shoulders, legs, or arms. While normally applied to the skin, it can be applied to armor or clothing. Applying a dose of war paint is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. War paint does not take up an item slot, but you can only benefit from one color of war paint at a time&#8212;applying a dose of a different color replaces the effects of the previous application. Once applied, the effects granted by the war paint last for 2 hours. You may select this talent multiple times; each time you gain knowledge of two more types of war paint. War paint have the following effects based on their color:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Black:</strong> You gain a +5 competence bonus to Stealth checks, +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Blue:</strong> You gain a 5-foot enhancement bonus to your base land move speed. The bonus to speed increases by 5 feet per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Green:</strong> Increase the duration of all morale bonuses received by 1 round, +1 round per 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Indigo:</strong> You gain electricity resistance 5, +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Olive:</strong> You gain acid resistance 5, +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Orange:</strong> You gain damage reduction 1/&#8212;, this damage reduction increases by 1 per 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy). This effect stacks with similar forms of damage reduction (such as that granted by the barbarian class).</li>\n<li><strong>Red:</strong> You gain fire resistance 5, +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Silver:</strong> You gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC, +1 per 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>Turquoise:</strong> You gain cold resistance 5, +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n<li><strong>White:</strong> You gain a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws against level drain, negative energy, Death sphere and other magical death effects. The resistance bonus increases by +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy). As soon as you would fail a saving throw from such an effect, you may end the white war paint&#8217;s effect as an immediate action to reroll the saving throw.</li>\n<li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Grants a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks, +1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can increase the Craft DC for this formulae in increments of 5 to increase the duration of the war paint&#8217;s effects by 2 additional hours.</p>\n",
