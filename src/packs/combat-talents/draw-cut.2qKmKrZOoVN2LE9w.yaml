      <p>You may ready an attack action to attack a creature with a sheathed
      weapon, drawing the weapon as part of the triggered action. If the attack
      is successful, in addition to its normal effects you may perform a single
      disarm, sunder, or feint attempt against the target as an attack of
      opportunity.</p>
