      <p>You can make a impale attempt against a creature who is currently
      impaled; if you do so, they take a -1 penalty to attack rolls and armor
      class for each weapon currently impaling them. As long as no other
      creatures are holding any weapons currently impaling the creature, you may
      choose to remove all weapons currently impaling it as an attack action by
      making a single combat maneuver check against the creature&#8217;s CMD,
      dealing damage equal to the weapon&#8217;s base damage die for each weapon
      removed with this talent. If you do not have enough hands to carry all of
      these weapons you may choose which ones to hold, with any remaining
      weapons falling to your feet.</p>
