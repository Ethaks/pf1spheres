      <p>When triggered, this trap erects a distracting, scratchable pole which
      occupies the nearest unoccupied square to the triggering square. The
      scratching post is an object which remains in that square for 1 minute per
      rank of Craft (traps) you possess and the square it occupies is treated as
      difficult terrain. The creature which triggered this trap must immediately
      attempt a saving throw or suffer the scratching post&#8217;s
      penalties.</p>

      <p>Whenever an enemy within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 ranks of
      Craft (traps) you possess) who can see the scratching post makes an attack
      roll that does not include the scratching post, that creature must succeed
      at a Will saving throw or take a penalty on all attack rolls they make
      until the start of their next turn equal to -2 - 1 per 5 ranks in Craft
      (traps). If the creature successfully saves against the scratching
      post&#8217;s effect, they are immune until the start of their next turn.
      If there are multiple scratching posts, a creature only needs to succeed
      at a single saving throw to resist their allure (against the highest
      DC).</p>

      <p><strong>Scratching Post</strong><br>

      The scratching post is a wooden object approximately 3 to 5 feet tall with
      the following statistics:<br>

      <strong>Hit Points</strong> 5 + 3 per rank in Craft (traps)<br>

      <strong>AC</strong> 5 + 1 per rank in Craft (traps)<br>

      <strong>CMD</strong> 15 + 1 per rank in Craft (traps)<br>

      <strong>Hardness</strong> 5<br>

      As an object, the scratching post cannot succeed at saving throws and can
      otherwise be interacted with as a normal object. However, the scratching
      post is firmly grounded and difficult to move. The materials it is
      constructed from are scavenged and temporary, and cannot be salvaged from
      a broken trap or after the trap&#8217;s duration expires.</p>
