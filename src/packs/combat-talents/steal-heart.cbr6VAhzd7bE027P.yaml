      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere, Sleight of Hand 7
      ranks.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus to perform a steal combat maneuver as
      a full-round action. Rather than steal an object, you may force the target
      to make a successful Will saving throw or have their attitude towards you
      improved to friendly for a number of minutes equal to your ranks in
      Sleight of Hand. If the target is in combat, is already hostile to you, or
      is aware you are using this ability, they gain a +5 bonus to this saving
      throw. This is a spell-like, mind-altering (charm) effect.</p>

      <p>You may only have a number of creatures charmed at a time equal to your
      practitioner modifier; if you attempt to charm another, the creature you
      have had charmed for the longest is no longer charmed. Once a creature has
      been affected by or made a saving throw against this talent, they cannot
      be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>You may only affect creatures who share your creature type with this
      talent. When you possess 10 or more ranks in Sleight of Hand, you may
      target any creature regardless of creature type (except for those immune
      to such abilities).</p>
