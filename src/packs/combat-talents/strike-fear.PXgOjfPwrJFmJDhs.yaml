      <p>As a full-round action, you may expend martial focus to make an
      Intimidate check to demoralize all targets within 30 ft. of you who can
      both see and hear you. You may choose to take a -10 penalty on the check;
      if you do so you do not have to expend martial focus. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Dazzling Display.</p>
