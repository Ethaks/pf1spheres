      <p>The bleeding wounds you inflict are more difficult to close; it takes
      at least 5 points of healing at one time or a DC 20 Heal check to end
      bleed effects you cause. At base attack bonus +5 and every 5 points of
      base attack bonus thereafter, the amount of healing required and the Heal
      DC to stop bleeding from your effects increase by 5.</p>
