      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere.</p>

      <p>When performing a steal combat maneuver, rather than steal an item, you
      may expend your martial focus to steal their Charisma. If successful, the
      creature suffers a -4 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks for 10
      minutes. They are unaware of this penalty. For every 4 ranks in Sleight of
      Hand you possess, this penalty increases by -2. When you have at least 10
      ranks in Sleight of Hand, this penalty lasts for one hour. This is a
      supernatural effect.</p>
