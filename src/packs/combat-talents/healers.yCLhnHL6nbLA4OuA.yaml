      <p>Your followers include healers. They can supply you with one complete
      healer&#8217;s kit each day, increasing by 1 additional kit for every 5
      ranks in Diplomacy that you possess. These healers kits cannot be sold or
      stockpiled. These healers can treat wounds as you rest, restoring 10 hit
      points per rank in Diplomacy to a number of creatures equal to your
      practitioner modifier (minimum 1) over 8 hours of rest.</p>

      <p>Any Heal checks made while with the followers automatically gain a +2
      circumstance bonus from the healers&#8217; aid. This bonus increases by +1
      for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Messengers talent, your messengers can carry wounded
      allies to your followers or caravan or can administer limited healing.
      This limited healing requires 10 minutes and restores up to 2 hit points
      per rank in Diplomacy. A creature may only benefit from this healing a
      number of times per day equal to your practitioner modifier.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (cohort) package, your cohorts begin each day with a
      complete healer&#8217;s kit. These kits cannot be sold or stockpiled.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Influence or Magic capital in place of earning gold, with 15 gp
      equalling 1 Influence or 50 gp equaling 1 Magic. Use your Diplomacy
      modifier for making the earnings checks. This stacks with capital gains
      from other talents.</p>
