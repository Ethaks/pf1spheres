    value: >
      <p>When an ally within your threatened area is the target of an attack
      roll, you may spend an immediate action to grant them a competence bonus
      to their armor class equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus (rounded down,
      minimum +1) against that attack. If this attack would still hit, you may
      choose to take the damage in your ally&#8217;s place.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (patrol) package, when using this talent you may
      move to put the ally within your reach (with the normal limits for moving
      as part of your patrol) as part of activating this talent.</p>
