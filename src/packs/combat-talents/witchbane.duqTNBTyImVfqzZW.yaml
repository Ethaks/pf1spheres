      <p>You may choose for your poison to make the creature suffer 10% spell
      failure instead of fatigue. Creatures who fail two consecutive saving
      throws against this poison instead suffer 20% spell failure, and creatures
      who fail three consecutive saving throws suffer 50% spell failure. If a
      creature is suffering spell failure chance from another source (such as
      spell failure from the Somatic Casting general drawback), add this spell
      failure to the other source to get a single spell failure source. This
      spell failure applies to all spells, spell-like, supernatural, and
      spherecasting abilities that the creature possesses.</p>
