      <p>While in this stance, whenever you successfully use a dirty trick or
      steal combat maneuver against a creature, you also deal damage equal to
      1/2 your ranks in Sleight of Hand + your practitioner modifier. At 10
      ranks in Sleight of Hand, whenever you deal damage with this stance, you
      can move up to half your speed (this movement does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity from creatures damaged by this talent).</p>
