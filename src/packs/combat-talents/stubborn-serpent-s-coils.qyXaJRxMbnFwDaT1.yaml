      <p>You channel the serpent, improving your tenacity and grip.</p>

      <p>You gain the following abilities which can be used while grappling:</p>

      <p><strong>When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From
      You:</strong> While you are grappling another creature, any effect which
      would move your grappled target out of your reach must also succeed
      against you and your relevant statistic (CMD, saving throw, ability check,
      etc.) or fail to move the grappled target.</p>

      <p><strong>When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled
      Target:</strong> If an effect would move you away from your grappled
      target, you may attempt a grapple combat maneuver against your grappled
      target&#8217;s CMD as an immediate action. If the target is battered, you
      may spend an attack of opportunity in place of an immediate action
      instead. If you are successful, the grappled target is moved into the
      nearest unoccupied and safe space within your reach and remains grappled.
      A grappled target being moved this way does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity.</p>

      <p>If there is no unoccupied, safe space within your reach when attempting
      to move your grappled target with you, the target is moved into the
      nearest unoccupied, safe space near your new location, is released from
      your grapple, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your
      practitioner modifier (minimum 1 round).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> The abilities granted by Stubborn
      Serpent&#8217;s Coils do not function against Warp sphere effects or other
      teleportation effects. If you possess the Inescapable Grasp talent, you
      may use the abilities granted by this talent against teleportation or Warp
      effects originating from a source other than your grappled target which
      would move your grappled target out of your grapple.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From
      You:</strong> You are granted a saving throw or other appropriate check to
      negate a teleportation effect which would move your grappled target out of
      your grapple, as described in this ability.</li>

      <li><strong>When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled
      Target:</strong> You may include your grappled target in a teleport effect
      that would move you. If your grappled target is unwilling, the
      teleportation effect must be able to target an unwilling creature and the
      creature receives a saving throw against the effect, otherwise the
      grappled target is not moved with you and your grapple ends.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Grappling is a complex and often confusing
      combat maneuver. Two examples are included with this talent to help better
      demonstrate how this talent is used.</p>

      <p><em>If your grappled target is being moved away from you:</em> A
      creature which uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push your grappled
      target away from you must also succeed against your CMD while grappling. A
      Wind severity effect would fail to push your grappled target if the Wind
      severity effect fails to push you. If a Telekinesis sphere effect would
      attempt to lift and move your grappled target out of your reach, the
      Telekinesis sphere caster would treat this as contested control over an
      item.</p>

      <p><em>If you are being moved away from your grappled target:</em> If a
      creature uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push you away from your
      grappled target, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver as an immediate
      action (or as an attack of opportunity if the target is battered) against
      your grappled target. If you are successful, the grappled target also
      moves into an unoccupied, safe space within your reach and your grapple
      would not end.</p>
