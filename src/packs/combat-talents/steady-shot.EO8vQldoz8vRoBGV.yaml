      <p>When performing a deadly shot, you may ignore the cover bonus to AC
      granted to targets by anything less than total cover, and the miss chance
      granted to targets by anything less than total concealment. Total cover
      and total concealment provide their normal benefits against your ranged
      attacks. At +10 base attack bonus, you also ignore total concealment.</p>
