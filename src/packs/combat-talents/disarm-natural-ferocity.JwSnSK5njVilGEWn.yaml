      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere.</p>

      <p>You may perform disarm combat maneuvers against creatures who are not
      holding a weapon or object.</p>

      <p>Whenever you succeed at a disarm combat maneuver check against a
      creature, instead of disarming a weapon or object held by the target, you
      may choose to disarm that target&#8217;s ability to use one natural attack
      of your choice or the target&#8217;s ability to make unarmed strikes. The
      target gains the battered condition until the end of your next turn. As
      long as the target has the battered condition, the target is treated as
      though they do not possess the disarmed natural attack or the ability to
      make unarmed strikes and cannot make attacks or threaten with the chosen
      weapon.</p>

      <p>For the purposes of this ability, unarmed strikes are considered a
      single weapon, and a creature disarmed of their unarmed strike is unable
      to make unarmed strikes for as long as they are battered.</p>
