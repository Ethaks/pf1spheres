      <p>While in this stance, demoralized hostile creatures treat squares
      adjacent to you as difficult terrain, and they provoke attacks of
      opportunity for 5-foot steps made to leave those squares. If you have 10
      or more ranks in Intimidate, this stance instead applies to all squares
      within your reach.</p>
