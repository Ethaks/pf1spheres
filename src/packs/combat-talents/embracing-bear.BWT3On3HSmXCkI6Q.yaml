    value: >
      <p>While in this stance and a creature within reach targets you with a
      melee attack, before the attack roll is made you may allow the attack to
      automatically strike you (although the roll is still made to determine if
      the attack threatens a critical hit). After the damage is determined, you
      may spend an attack of opportunity to attempt to initiate a grapple
      against that creature as a free action that may be taken even when it is
      not your turn, if it is in range. You may not use this talent in
      conjunction with (deflect) talents or any other ability that would grant
      you an attack or combat maneuver due to a missed attack against you.</p>
