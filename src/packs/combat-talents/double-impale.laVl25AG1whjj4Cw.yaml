    value: >
      <p>If you successfully impale a creature with a weapon wielded with two
      hands, you can expend your martial focus to make an additional attack roll
      against a creature adjacent to that creature with the same penalty. If
      this attack is successful, that creature takes damage and is also impaled.
      While they are impaled, both creatures are forced to act on the same
      initiative count (whichever is lower between the two) until they are no
      longer impaled, and both can only move if both agree to move using both of
      their move actions, using the slower of their speeds to determine movement
      between the two using a movement type both share. The creature who was
      impaled first cannot remove the weapon impaling them as long as it is
      still impaling the creature who was impaled second, but both can make a
      combat maneuver check to remove it, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on
      this check. The creature who was impaled second can choose to attempt to
      free only themselves from the impaling weapon.</p>
