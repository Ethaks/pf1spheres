    value: >
      <p>When affected by an area attack, you may spend your martial focus as an
      immediate action to use your shield to cushion the blow, granting you the
      benefits of the evasion ability (regardless of armor worn), and adding
      your shield bonus (but not your active defense bonus) to your Reflex
      saving throw against the triggering effect. If you already possesses
      evasion, you instead gain improved evasion.</p>

      <p>All allied creatures in a cone originating from your space and facing
      away from the effect&#8217;s point of origin gain the benefits of this
      ability. Medium creatures create a 15-ft. cone. For every 4 points of base
      attack bonus and for every size category you are larger than Medium, the
      size of the cone increases by 5 ft. The size of the cone decreases by 5
      ft. (minimum 5 ft.) for every size category you are smaller than
      Medium.</p>
