      <p>When you use this shout, your opponents&#8217; attention is drawn to
      you for its duration, making it hard for them to focus on your allies.
      Allies within the shout&#8217;s affected area may make a Stealth check to
      hide even if they do not have cover or concealment for the duration of the
      shout, but you automatically fail any Stealth checks for the shout&#8217;s
      duration.</p>
