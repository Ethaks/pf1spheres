      <p>If you are adjacent to a willing ally, you may make an Intimidate check
      as a full-round action against all hostile creatures watching you to
      influence their attitude, using dangerous looking moves against your ally
      while not dealing any actual damage to them. You gain a +2 to this
      Intimidate check for every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess.
      Creatures who have their attitude shifted by this talent have their
      attitude reverted to neutral rather than unfriendly, and any creature
      whose attitude is shifted by this talent takes a -2 penalty to saving
      throws against fear effects which originate from you for 1 day.</p>

      <p>You can also use a grapple check with a willing ally as a Perform check
      for the purposes of making money gaining a +2 bonus for every 4 points of
      base attack bonus you possess (this is treated as a performance check for
      bonuses that would apply to making performance checks).</p>

      <p>Each willing ally who participates in this talent for either use of it
      gives you an additional +2 bonus on this check (up to 5 additional
      allies), allowing you to further demonstrate your grappling prowess.</p>

      <p>Those observing you using this talent can make a Perception check with
      a DC of 10 + your grapple check to see that it is fake, which shifts their
      attitude 1 step closer towards hostile towards you and any ally who
      participated in this talent.</p>
