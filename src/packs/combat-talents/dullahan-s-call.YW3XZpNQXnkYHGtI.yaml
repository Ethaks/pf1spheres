    value: >
      <p>You may expend your martial focus as a swift action and designate one
      creature suffering from a fear effect who can see and hear you, declaring
      their imminent doom. That creature must succeed at a Will save or become
      staggered for 1 round plus 1 round for every 4 ranks in Intimidate you
      possess.</p>

      <p>You gain a circumstance bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical
      hits equal to your practitioner modifier against creatures staggered by
      this effect. You may perform a boast even if you do not have martial focus
      after confirming a critical hit against a target staggered by this effect.
      <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Critical Focus.</p>
