      <p>Your followers includes crafters who can repair broken weapons, armor,
      and other non-magical items while you rest. The followers can remove the
      broken condition from and restore to full hit points to one non-magic
      weapon, shield, suit of armor, or other object of no greater than large
      size during an eight-hour rest. If repairing an object larger than this
      maximum size, the amount of hit points restored is halved for every size
      category the object is above the maximum. The followers can repair an
      additional item for every 3 ranks in Diplomacy you possess. You may choose
      to count a Huge object as two Large objects, a Gargantuan object as two
      Huge objects, etc.</p>

      <p>At 5 ranks of Diplomacy, the followers can repair magical items with a
      caster level no greater than your ranks in Diplomacy; each such item
      counts as two items for determining the number of items that may be
      repaired at one time. A Huge magic item would count as 4 items, a
      Gargantuan magic item as 8 items, etc.</p>

      <p>In place of repairing an item, the followers can craft a non-magical
      item, requiring that you pay the normal crafting cost. The caravan makes
      10 gp of progress per rank in Diplomacy per day and can craft masterwork
      items.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Merchants talent, non-magical weapons, armor, and
      ammunition purchased from the followers have their cost reduced by
      half.</p>

      <p>Any Craft checks made to craft non-magical, non-alchemical items (such
      as, but not limited to weapons, armor, shields, and ammunition) made while
      with the followers automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus from the
      crafters&#8217; aid. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in
      Diplomacy that you possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (cohort) package, your cohorts possess masterwork
      weapons and armor.</p>

      <p>If using the downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Goods capital in place of earning gold, with 10 gp equaling 1
      Good. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This
      stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>
