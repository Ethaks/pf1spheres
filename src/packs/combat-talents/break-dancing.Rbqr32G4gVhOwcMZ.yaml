      <p>After making a sunder attempt, you may attempt an Acrobatics or Perform
      (dance) check as a swift action with a DC equal to the target of your
      sunder&#8217;s CMD. If you succeed, you may move up to half your speed.
      This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you succeed at
      this check by 10 or more, your sweet moves restore your martial focus.</p>
