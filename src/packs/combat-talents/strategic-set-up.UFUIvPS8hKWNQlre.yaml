      <p>Whenever you use dual attack and successfully damage a creature with
      your main-hand weapon, if you attempt a combat maneuver check against that
      same creature in place of your offhand attack, treat yourself as if you
      were 1 size category larger than you are when calculating your combat
      maneuver bonus and your ability to affected that target. For every 5
      points of base attack bonus you possess, you are treated as an additional
      size larger.</p>
