      <p>You may make melee attacks with a loaded sling, threatening an area as
      appropriate. Making attacks in this fashion does not use up ammunition.
      Also, when making attacks in this fashion, your sling gains the trip and
      disarm weapon special features. Treat a loaded double sling as a double
      weapon. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Sling Flail.</p>
