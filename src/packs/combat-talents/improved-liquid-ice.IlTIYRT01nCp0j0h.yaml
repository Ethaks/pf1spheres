      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>

      <p>You create a flask of liquid that when opened begins to hiss and
      evaporate. You can open this flask and pour out the contents in order to
      freeze a liquid (one 5-foot cube per 2 ranks of Craft (alchemy)) or coat
      an area of liquid, 20 feet in diameter, in a layer of ice strong enough to
      support Medium-sized creatures.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can throw the flask as a splash weapon with a range
      increment of 10 feet, dealing 1d6 cold damage + 1d6 per 3 ranks of Craft
      (alchemy) you possess to the target of a direct hit and half that damage
      to targets 5 feet from the point of contact, (to a maximum of half the
      damage dealt to the primary target) and 1 point of cold splash damage per
      die of damage this weapon deals to targets 10 feet away. Targets directly
      hit by this alchemical weapon must make a Fortitude save or be staggered
      and have their movement speed reduced by half for one round.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each
      time you do so, the range for each damage increment increase by 5 feet
      (for example, if you increase the Craft DC to 35, you deal full damage to
      all targets within 5 feet of the point of contact, half damage to all
      targets 10 feet away from the point of contact, and 1 point of damage to
      all creatures within 15 feet.) and the number of frozen cubes of liquid
      doubles. This also doubles the diameter of a layer of ice, and the maximum
      size of the creatures it can support increases by 1 size category.</p>
