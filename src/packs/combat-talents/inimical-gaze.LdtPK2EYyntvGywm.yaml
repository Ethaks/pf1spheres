      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scout sphere, Perception 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>The scout ability granted by the Scout sphere is now a gaze attack that
      can affect any creature within 60 ft. You may activate this gaze as a free
      action and it stays active until the end of your next turn. Any creature
      subject to the gaze that fails a Will save is automatically scouted by
      you.</p>
