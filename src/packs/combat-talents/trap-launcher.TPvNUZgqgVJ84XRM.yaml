      <p>You&#8217;re capable of setting traps at a distance. When placing a
      trap with a creation time of a standard action or less, you may increase
      the DC to create the trap by 10 in order to place the trap within the
      first range increment of a ranged weapon you are wielding. This is
      considered a ranged attack and as such provokes attacks of opportunity and
      is subject to conditions that affect ranged attacks (such as wind).</p>

      <p>If you possess the Sniper sphere, you may treat this talent as a
      (snipe) talent that allows you to shoot your traps directly at creatures.
      As part of a deadly shot, you create a snare trap that requires a standard
      action or less to create and fire it (this ignores the limitation of
      placing traps only within the first range increment of the weapon). A
      creature hit by the attack makes a Reflex save as normal to prevent
      triggering the snare, as if the snare trap originated from their square.
      As the trap is never set, creatures do not gain any bonus to AC or saves
      for seeing you set the trap. If a trap would usually activate multiple
      times, it only activates once. If the attack misses, the trap is
      destroyed.</p>
