    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver, the
      target of your dirty trick takes a -5 penalty to Diplomacy checks and a -2
      penalty to damage rolls for 1 minute, although the penalty to damage rolls
      can be removed in the same action required to remove the effects of the
      dirty trick. In addition, if that creature fails a Diplomacy check, they
      are treated as though they had failed by 10 or more. When you have at
      least 10 ranks in Sleight of Hand, these penalties are doubled and its
      duration is increased to 10 minutes.</p>
