    value: >
      <p>As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against a
      creature, dealing damage equal to your Strength modifier (or whichever
      attribute was used to make the check). The next successful attack action,
      attack of opportunity, or additional attack granted by a class feature or
      talent an ally makes against that creature before the start of your next
      turn has its base critical threat range doubled; this does not stack with
      other abilities which would increase critical threat range, such as
      Improved Critical. A critical hit scored while a creature is affected by
      this ability has its critical multiplier reduced to x2 if it would
      normally be higher. For every 5 base attack bonus you possess, Lotus Touch
      applies to one more eligible attack made before the start of your next
      turn. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Butterfly&#8217;s Sting.</p>
