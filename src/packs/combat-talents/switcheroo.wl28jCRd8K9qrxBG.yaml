      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a steal combat maneuver, you may
      replace what you stole with a different item, placing it in either an
      empty hand or pocket of the creature. If the item you placed on their
      person is somehow volatile (such as a vial of alchemist&#8217;s fire, a
      thunderstone, or an alchemist&#8217;s bomb), you can rig that item to
      explode as an immediate action (you must choose when to make the item
      explode within a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Sleight of Hand);
      you are immune to any damage or effects of explosions triggered in this
      manner. When you have at least 10 ranks in Sleight of Hand, you may choose
      when to make the item explode within a number of minutes equal to your
      ranks in Sleight of Hand.</p>
