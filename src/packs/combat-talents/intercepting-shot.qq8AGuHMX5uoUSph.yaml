      <p>As a readied action, you may attempt to shoot down a ranged attack.
      This does not work against unusually massive ranged weapons (such as
      boulders or ballista bolts, unless you are also using a massive
      projectile, such as a boulder or siege weapon ammunition of no more than 1
      size smaller), natural attacks, or ranged attacks generated by spell
      effects. Make a ranged attack. If your attack roll is higher than the
      attack roll of the ranged attack you are intercepting, their attack is
      negated. You suffer a -4 penalty to this attack roll for every size
      category larger than you the attacker is.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Vigilant Sharpshooter talent, you may use an attack
      of opportunity to make an intercepting shot against a ranged attack that
      crosses through your threatened area.</p>
