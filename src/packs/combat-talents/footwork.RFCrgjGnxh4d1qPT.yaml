      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you may make a 5-foot step as an
      immediate action. If this movement is done in response to an attack made
      against you, you gain an extra +2 dodge bonus to your AC and CMD against
      that attack. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during
      your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn,
      subtract 5 ft. from your total movement.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice. If taken twice, you may move up to 10
      ft. when you take this immediate action. You may still take a 5-foot step
      during your next turn, and any movement you make using this talent does
      not subtract any distance from your movement during your next turn.
      <strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Step Up, Following Step if taken
      twice.</p>
