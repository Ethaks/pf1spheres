      <p>As a special attack action, you may make an attack with a ranged
      weapon. You may add any one (snipe) talent you know to this attack.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may expend your martial focus to increase the damage
      dealt by the attack by 1d10, or 1d6 if the attack targets touch AC or is
      made with a scatter weapon. You must choose whether or not to use this
      ability before making your attack roll. These extra damage dice are not
      multiplied on a critical hit, but are added to the total. For every 4
      points of base attack bonus you possess, you deal an additional 1d10
      damage, or an additional 1d6 if the attack targets touch AC or is made
      with a scatter weapon.</p>

      <p>Some talents are marked (snipe). These talents add additional effects
      when you perform a deadly shot. You may only apply the effects of one
      (snipe) talent to each deadly shot.</p>
