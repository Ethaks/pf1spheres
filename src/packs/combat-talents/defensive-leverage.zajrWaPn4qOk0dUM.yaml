      <p>While in this stance, as long as you are impaling an adjacent creature
      and controlling the weapon used to impale them, you gain a 20% miss chance
      against all attack rolls made against you. If this talent causes an attack
      made against you to miss, you may spend an attack of opportunity to
      redirect the attack against an adjacent creature you are currently
      impaling this way as a free action that can be taken even outside of your
      turn.</p>
