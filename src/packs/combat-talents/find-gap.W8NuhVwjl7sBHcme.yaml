      <p>Whenever you successfully use the scout ability against a creature, you
      treat their AC as 1 lower than it actually is for a number of rounds equal
      to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum 1). For every 4 ranks you
      possess, treat their AC as an additional 1 point lower.</p>
