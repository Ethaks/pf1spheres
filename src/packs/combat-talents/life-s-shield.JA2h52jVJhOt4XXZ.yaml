      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Shield sphere, Sacrificial Shield, base
      attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>Whenever an attack would reduce you to 0 or fewer hit points you may
      activate your Sacrificial Shield talent as a free action that may be taken
      even when it is not your turn. If your shield would be broken or destroyed
      by this effect, you retain your shield&#8217;s enhancement bonus (if any)
      to your AC for a number of rounds equal to your base attack bonus. If you
      possess the Soul&#8217;s Shield talent, you also retain your resistance
      bonus to saving throws for a number of rounds equal to your base attack
      bonus.</p>
