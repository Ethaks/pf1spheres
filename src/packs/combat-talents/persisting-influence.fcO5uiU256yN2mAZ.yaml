      <p>Your leadership in battle clings to allies and enemies alike. Whenever
      the benefits of a shout or tactic you initiated would end, their benefits
      persist for +1 round, increasing by +1 for every 7 ranks in Diplomacy you
      possess. Instantaneous effects are not affected by this talent, nor are
      tactics that end because you used a swift action to activate a different
      tactic.</p>
