      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere, Steal Skill, Sleight
      of Hand 7 ranks.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use the Steal Skill talent, you may choose to steal a feat
      or talent (magic or combat) instead of a skill. Associated feats and
      talents count as each other for this purpose, as do skill ranks and
      talents that provide skill ranks. The target&#8217;s CMD is increased by 2
      for every feat or talent the target possesses that has the targeted feat
      or talent as a prerequisite. Likewise, the target&#8217;s CMD is also
      increased by 2 for every talent the target possesses in a sphere if you
      are trying to steal the base sphere. This is a supernatural effect.</p>
