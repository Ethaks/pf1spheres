      <p>While in this stance, whenever you miss a creature with a melee attack
      made as part of a dual attack, the first melee attack that creature makes
      against you until the beginning of your next turn provokes an attack of
      opportunity from you. You must make the attack of opportunity with a melee
      weapon you missed the creature with during your dual attack, and the
      attack suffers the same penalties as it did during the dual attack. You
      may not use this talent in conjunction with (deflect) talents or any other
      ability that would grant you an attack or combat maneuver due to a missed
      attack against you.</p>
