      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Barroom sphere (Barroom Expert), base
      attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>As part of an attack action, you may expend your martial focus and
      break a weapon. Your attack is treated as a critical threat and you must
      roll to confirm the critical hit as normal. A critical hit made this way
      has a critical multiplier of x2, even if it would normally be higher.
      After using this talent, you cannot use this (smash) talent for 1
      minute.</p>
