      <p>You may expend martial focus as an immediate action in order to place a
      Trap sphere trap in a viable square as part of a steal or dirty trick
      combat maneuver. You must be able to create the trap as part of the same
      action required to perform the maneuver in question and must still succeed
      on the check DC to set it up.</p>
