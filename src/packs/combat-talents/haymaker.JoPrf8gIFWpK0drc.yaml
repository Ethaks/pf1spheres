      <p>Whenever you attack with a counter punch, you may aim for the
      target&#8217;s mouth or equivalent orifice impeding their ability to
      speak. If your attack is successful the target must succeed on a
      concentration check to cast any spell with a verbal or equivalent
      component, adding 1/4 your base attack bonus (minimum 1) to the DC of the
      check. This effect can be ended as a standard action by a Heal check with
      a DC equal to the concentration DC, or when the target receives at least 1
      point of magical healing.</p>
