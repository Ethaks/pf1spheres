      <p>No doubt stops your onslaught. You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws
      against mind-affecting effects and the DC to Intimidate you, increasing by
      +1 for every 6 base attack bonus you possess. Whenever you would attempt a
      save against a mind-affecting effect, you may roll twice, taking the
      better result.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may expend martial focus as an immediate action to
      attempt a save against a mind-affecting effect (using the effect&#8217;s
      original DC) or reduce your current level of fear by 1 step (panicked to
      frightened, frightened to shaken, shaken to not affected by a fear
      effect). You may only attempt a new save against a specific mind-affecting
      effect (for example, a specific instance of charm) once per day.</p>
