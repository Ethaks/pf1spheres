    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a bull rush, drag, overrun, or
      reposition maneuver against a creature (other than with maneuvers
      performed as a free action), that creature suffers damage equal to your
      unarmed strike or a light weapon you are wielding. This qualifies your
      bull rush, drag, overrun, and reposition maneuvers for feats and talents
      such as Power Attack, suffering a penalty to your CMB in exchange for
      increased damage.</p>

      <p>You may use your unarmed strike or a light weapon you are holding to
      make these maneuvers, meaning you may add their enhancement bonus, as well
      as spells or feats which increase their attack bonus such as Weapon Focus,
      to your CMB when performing a bull rush, drag, overrun, or reposition
      maneuver.</p>
