    value: >
      <p>You must expend an existing non-Alchemy sphere poison in your
      possession as part of creating this poison, and the type of poison created
      must be of the same type (inhaled, injury, etc.) as the poison expended.
      Instead of causing fatigue, your poison makes the target suffer the
      effects of the expended poison. Creatures who fail consecutive saving
      throws against this poison are subject to the secondary and tertiary
      effects of this poison (if any). The poison is still treated as an Alchemy
      sphere poison; using your Alchemy sphere DCs, and benefiting from your
      Alchemy sphere talents, and its effects (excluding damage) lasting as long
      as an Alchemy sphere poison.</p>
