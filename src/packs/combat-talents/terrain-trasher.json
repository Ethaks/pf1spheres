      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Brute sphere, base attack bonus +5.</p>\n<p>You may make a Strength check to break a solid surface such as a wall, door, or floor within your reach as a move action rather than a standard action. If successful, not only do you break the object, but you also rip out a large chunk of up to your size or smaller, chosen by you. If you so choose, you may use this chunk as a rock for the Rock Toss Equipment talent, or as an improvised weapon. Unsolid surfaces such as loose dirt cannot be broken in this fashion.</p>\n<p>When using this talent against a large surface such as a stone wall or floor, you rip out a 1 ft. thick slab off of the surface in question. If the surface is thicker (for example, ripping apart 3 ft. thick walls or the ground) this leaves a 1 ft. hole deep hole in the surface. Calculate the break DC as if the material were 1 ft. thick. Ripping a Medium-sized chunk leaves a 5 ft. square hole, while the hole is half as large for each size category smaller, and twice as large for each size category larger.</p>\n<p>If you rip a hole in the floor, the pit is deep enough that it can potentially trip creatures. Any creature occupying the square when you first create the hole, or who is shoved into the hole such as through a bull rush, drag, or reposition maneuver, must make a Reflex saving throw to avoid falling prone in an adjacent square. If the hole is smaller than a 5 ft. square, the creature gains a +2 bonus to this saving throw per size category smaller the hole is. A creature that makes its saving throw still treats the space as difficult terrain.</p>\n",
