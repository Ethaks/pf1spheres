      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Beastmastery sphere, Handle Animal 5
      ranks.</p>

      <p>You may speak with animals. You can ask questions of and receive
      answers from animals, but this ability doesn&#8217;t make them any more
      friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and
      evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is
      friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.</p>
