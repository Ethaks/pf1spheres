      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you do not take a -4 penalty to
      Dexterity or a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks
      and are treated as though both of your hands were free while grappling a
      creature. In addition, as long as you are the one who initiated the
      grapple, the creature grants you soft cover against all attacks while you
      are grappling them except attacks made by the grappled foe.</p>
