      <p>As part of performing an attack action, you may break a weapon. If your
      attack is successful, you may move into any square the target threatens
      (to a maximum of half your movement speed). This movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity from that creature, but otherwise provokes attacks
      of opportunity as normal. If you were not within the creature&#8217;s
      threatened area (such as by breaking and throwing an improvised thrown
      weapon at range or because the creature does not threaten the square you
      made the attack from), you may instead take a 5-foot step and subtract 5
      feet from your total movement during your next turn.</p>

      <p>In addition, whenever you move, you can pick up an unattended item as
      part of that movement. You must have a free hand to pick up an item this
      way. Picking up an item this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
      Whenever you would use this ability, you may attempt to instead pick up
      multiple, smaller and closely gathered items that could be held in one
      hand (such as a stack of plates or a fistful of nails) this way equal to
      your practitioner modifier (minimum 1). Smaller items are generally two
      sizes smaller (or smaller) than the practitioner. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Grab and Go.</p>
