    value: >
      <p>You can choose for your poison to not cause fatigue, instead causing it
      to alter the thought process of those subjected to it (this talent cannot
      be used with a contact or inhaled poison). Those who are under the effects
      of this poison can select a single Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma-based
      skill, gaining a +2 alchemical bonus to the next check they make with that
      skill within 1 minute. Those under the effects of this poison suffer a -5
      penalty to Initiative checks for 1 minute. For every 5 ranks in Craft
      (alchemy) you possess, this bonus increases by +2. A creature cannot
      benefit from a Psychotropic Hallucinogen more than once per hour.</p>
