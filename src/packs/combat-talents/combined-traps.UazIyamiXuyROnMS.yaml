      <p>You may increase the time required to place a trap by 2 steps (a move
      becomes a full-round, a standard becomes 1 round, and a full-round becomes
      1 minute) and increase the DC of placing the trap by 5. Doing so allows
      you to apply a second (dart) talent to a dart trap or a second (snare)
      talent to a snare trap. Alternatively, you may place a dart and snare trap
      in the same space to be triggered simultaneously. If you possess the Trap
      Wielder talent and combine it with this ability, resolve each trap
      separately.</p>
