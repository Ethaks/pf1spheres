      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere (Rift Strike
      (legendary)), base attack bonus +17.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus whenever you use your Berserker
      sphere Rift Strike talent. If you do, your Rift Strike&#8217;s maximum
      range becomes unlimited, allowing you to even teleport between planets,
      and may be used for interplanar travel, allowing you to teleport to
      alternate dimensions or planes. You must know the plane or planet you are
      trying to reach, as well as where within or on that planet you would like
      to appear.</p>

      <p>If you do not know a specific location to appear on that plane or
      planet, you may still use Rift Strike to travel there, but you may appear
      anywhere on that plane.</p>

      <p>You may not use this talent to travel between a plane or planet if you
      are fatigued or exhausted.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> A private or secret plane or demiplane may not
      be traveled to using this talent unless you possess permission from the
      plane&#8217;s creator or owner, an appropriate tuning fork or key, or
      other object which anchors or strongly originates from that plane (subject
      to GM discretion).</p>
