      ft. of yourself with your ranged or thrown weapon. When making an attack
      of opportunity with a ranged weapon, you do not provoke an attack of
      opportunity with your ranged attack.</p>

      increase the distance that you threaten by +5 ft. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Snap Shot, Improved Snap Shot if taken twice.</p>
