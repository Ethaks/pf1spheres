    value: >
      <p>You may spend a move action to provoke an attack of opportunity from a
      creature that threatens you that is your size or larger. You may roll an
      Acrobatics check to jump and use the result in place of your AC when
      resolving this attack. If the attack of opportunity misses, you may use
      the creature&#8217;s weapon, limb, and motion to give you a boost. Use the
      result of the Acrobatics check to determine the distance of the jump,
      adding the creature&#8217;s Strength score (not Strength modifier) as a
      circumstance bonus to the check. This circumstance bonus only applies to
      the distance of the jump, not determining if the attack of opportunity
      hits. You may choose to use this ability on an ally; if so, the ally may
      choose to automatically miss on the attack of opportunity. Should the
      creature choose not to make the attack of opportunity provoked with this
      talent, you may choose to make an Acrobatics check to jump as part of the
      move action, but do not gain any additional bonus on the check. You may
      expend martial focus to use this ability whenever a creature misses you
      with an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement.</p>
