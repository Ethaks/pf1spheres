      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>

      <p>Improved bottled lightning unleashes a small bolt of lightning toward
      an enemy within 20 ft. of you. This is a ranged touch attack that deals
      1d8 points of electricity damage, plus 1d8 per 2 Craft (alchemy) ranks you
      possess. Any creature in a line between you and the target (including the
      target) takes 1 point of sonic damage plus 1 point per rank in Craft
      (alchemy) you possess from the terrific clap of thunder the bolt
      generates.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each
      time you do so, the range increases by 10 ft. and the sonic damage dealt
      to creatures in the line of effect increases by 1d6.</p>
