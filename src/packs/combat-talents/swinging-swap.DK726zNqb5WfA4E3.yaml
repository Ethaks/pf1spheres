    value: >
      <p>Whenever you make a successful unarmed strike against a creature using
      the attack action, you can swap positions with that creature (creatures
      larger than you must end this talent&#8217;s movement occupying at least
      one space that you did, allowing them to choose their exact position). If
      you successfully use this talent on the same creature during two
      consecutive rounds, that creature must make a successful Will saving throw
      or be confused for 1 round.</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, the duration of this confusion increases to a
      number of rounds equal to your practitioner modifier, although the
      creature can make an additional save at the beginning of each of its turns
      with a -2 penalty; this penalty increases by -2 each time you successfully
      use this talent against it while it is suffering the effects of this
      talent.</p>
