    value: >
      <p>Whenever you make an attack action with a light or one-handed weapon,
      you can make an additional attack with a light or one-handed weapon held
      in your off-hand, though both attacks take a -2 penalty on their attack
      rolls when doing so; only your initial main hand attack qualifies as an
      attack action, and the additional attack cannot be made with the same
      weapon as your initial main hand attack. Your off-hand attack only applies
      1/2 your Strength modifier, and if your off-hand attack is made with
      anything other than a light weapon, both attacks take an additional -2
      penalty. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Two-Weapon Fighting</p>
