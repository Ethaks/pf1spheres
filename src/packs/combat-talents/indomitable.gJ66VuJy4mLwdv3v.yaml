      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Guardian sphere, delayed damage pool,
      base attack bonus +6.</p>

      <p>When you would die, you may expend your martial focus to delay the
      onset of the dead condition until the end of your next turn. If you are
      not unconscious, you do not fall unconscious from hit point loss during
      this time. Any healing you receive during that turn that would bring you
      above your death threshold can prevent you from dying. Such healing has no
      affect on death from anything other than hit point damage. You may only
      delay death in this manner once per time that you would die.</p>
