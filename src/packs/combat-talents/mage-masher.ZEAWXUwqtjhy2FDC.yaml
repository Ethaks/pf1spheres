    value: >
      <p>Whenever you destroy a magic wand, staff, rod, scroll, or similar magic
      item held by an enemy with a sunder attempt as part of a brutal strike, if
      the item is destroyed, any excess damage is applied to the item&#8217;s
      wielder. No damage is transferred if you decide to leave the item with 1
      hit point. When targeting a battered creature, you may roll the sunder
      check twice and take the best result. In addition, you gain a competence
      bonus equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus on any Reflex saving throws made
      as a result of the item&#8217;s destruction (such as when destroying a
      staff of power).</p>
