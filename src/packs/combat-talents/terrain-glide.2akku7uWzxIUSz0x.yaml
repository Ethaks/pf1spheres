      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Swim 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>Your skills and muscles honed by swimming allow you to cleave through
      soil and snow with ease. You gain a 10 ft. burrow speed. If you already
      possess a burrow speed, it increases by 5 ft.</p>

      <p>This talent does not grant the ability to see through earth nor to
      breath without a source of air, so creatures without tremorsense or
      another similar ability are blind while underground and creatures that
      need to breathe must hold their breath.</p>
