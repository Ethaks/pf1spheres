    value: >
      <p>When you succeed at a disarm combat maneuver check against a creature,
      instead of disarming their weapon you may choose to bind their weapon to
      yours. This attempt may be made against creatures even if they are
      wielding nothing but natural attacks or unarmed strikes. As long as the
      creature&#8217;s weapon is bound, they cannot move from the square they
      currently occupy. A creature whose weapon is bound may release the weapon
      as a free action or attempt to break the bind as a standard action by
      making a successful combat maneuver check against your disarm CMD. If the
      bound weapon is a natural attack or unarmed strike, the creature must
      succeed at a successful combat maneuver check to break the bind. You
      cannot attack with the weapon or limb used to bind a creature as long as
      the bind is in effect, but may end the bind at any time as a free action.
      Binding a creature&#8217;s weapon counts as a disarm for talents and
      abilities that require a disarm check or attempt.</p>
