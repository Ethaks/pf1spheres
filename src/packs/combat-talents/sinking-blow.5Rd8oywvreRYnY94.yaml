    value: >
      <p>If you are flying or swimming, whenever you make a successful attack
      action against a creature employing the same movement mode as you while
      you have martial focus, that creature must succeed at a Reflex saving
      throw or lose 30 feet of distance to the ground. If you have 10 or more
      ranks in the used movement mode, a creature who fails this saving throw
      also has their speed for that movement mode reduced by 1/2 for a number of
      rounds equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1).</p>
