      "value": "<p>You may modify your formulae into an oil, called a coating that can be applied to weapons by increasing Craft (alchemy) DC to create them by 5. The coating&#8217;s effects are added to any attacks you make in which you successfully hit the target. Formulae applied as a coating only affect the target of the attack and lose any splash damage or area of effect they might normally possess. If the formulae does damage on a hit, the damage is reduced to 1d6 + 1/2 your ranks in Craft (alchemy) per successful attack. If a formulae normally deals multiple types of damage (such as fire and bludgeoning), it instead deals one type of damage (chosen at the time of the application).</p>\n<p>You may apply a coating to one weapon (including ranged weapons, which apply the effects to ammunition they fire), one end of a double weapon, or ten thrown weapons as a move action, or as a swift action if you expend your martial focus. Only one coating can be applied to any piece of equipment at a time. Any time that you could apply a poison to a weapon, you may instead apply a coating in its place.</p>\n<p>Once applied, coatings remain active for a number of rounds equal to your Practitioner modifier + 1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy). Additional damage from a coating is never multiplied on a critical hit, but otherwise stacks with effects such as flaming, shock, or corrosive.</p>\n",
