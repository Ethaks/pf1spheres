      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere (Panacea (formulae)),
      Craft (alchemy) 10 ranks.</p>

      <p>You manage to brew the perfect balance of arcane reagents and divine
      ingredients to create a single extract of a purely divine liquid, capable
      of curing almost anything. This extract can be used as a potion, and is
      used to cure a number of maladies and debilitations, determined by the
      Craft DC used for its creation:</p>

      <p><strong>DC 25:</strong> The creature is cured of a single curse effect
      affecting them.</p>

      <p><strong>DC 35:</strong> The creature removes all temporary negative
      levels or one permanent negative level they possess.</p>

      <p><strong>DC 40:</strong> The creature is healed of all broken bones,
      severed body parts, and ruined organs. This includes restoring senses that
      are impaired or lost, such as sight or hearing. This process of healing
      takes 10 minutes.</p>

      <p><strong>DC 50:</strong> The creature removes all temporary and
      permanent negative levels, and the creature is treated as benefiting from
      a miracle or wish spell for abilities and spells that specify they can
      only be removed by the use of these spells (but does not mimic any other
      applications of the spells).</p>

      <p>This ambrosia is often too much to handle for most creatures, with a
      particular creature only being able to benefit from an ambrosia once per
      day. Any additional attempts to drink an ambrosia during this period have
      no effect.</p>
