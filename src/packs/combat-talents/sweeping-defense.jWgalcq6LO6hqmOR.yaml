    value: >
      <p>When making an attack action, you may grant yourself a -2 penalty on
      all attack rolls until the beginning of your next turn to cause your
      attack action to deal damage to multiple targets. Choose one target that
      is adjacent to your primary target and also within your reach, and compare
      your attack roll to the AC of both targets. If your attack roll exceeds
      either target&#8217;s AC (including the primary target), that target
      suffers half damage from your attack. The additional target is not subject
      to non-damage parts of your attack action, such as additional effects
      granted by feats or talents. Additionally, all targets damaged by your
      Sweeping Defence suffer a -2 penalty to all attack rolls until the start
      of your next turn.</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, this penalty increases to -4 and you may
      target up to three adjacent targets with sweeping defense.</p>
