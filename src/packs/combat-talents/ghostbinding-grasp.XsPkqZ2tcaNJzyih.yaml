      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wrestling sphere (Inescapable Grasp),
      base attack bonus +7.</p>

      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you can attempt grapple attempts
      against incorporeal creatures.</p>

      <p>You can expend your martial focus as a free action whenever you
      successfully grapple an incorporeal creature to temporarily bind them to
      the world around you, allowing the creature to be affected normally by
      physical effects, as if they were corporeal, for as long as they remain
      grappled and for 1 round per 5 base attack bonus you possess after the
      grapple ends.</p>
