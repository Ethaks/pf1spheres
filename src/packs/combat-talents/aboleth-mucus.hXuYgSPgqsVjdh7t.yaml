      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere.</p>

      <p>You may choose to have your poison affect the target as per aboleth
      mucus rather than making them fatigued. The target takes a -2 penalty on
      Will saving throws and becomes unable to breathe air but can breathe
      underwater for 1 minute. Renewed contact with this poison and failing
      another save extends the effect by 1 minute and is cumulative. A creature
      unable to breathe air that remains out of water begins to suffocate unless
      they hold their breath.</p>
