      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Gladiator sphere, Intimidate 10
      ranks.</p>

      <p>Whenever you successfully demoralize a target or the target fails a
      Will save against a fear effect originating from you, you may expend your
      focus as a free action that may be taken even when it isn&#8217;t your
      turn to force the target to pass a Will save or become permanently afraid
      of you. While the creature sees you or otherwise becomes aware that you
      are within 60 ft. of it, it becomes shaken until 1d4 rounds after it no
      longer believes you are nearby. This effect is permanent until removed by
      a break enchantment, heal, limited wish, miracle, wish spell, or similar
      effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
