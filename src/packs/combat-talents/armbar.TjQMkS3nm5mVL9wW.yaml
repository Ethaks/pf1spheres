      <p>When you successfully maintain a grapple against a creature you have
      already pinned, you may expend your martial focus as an immediate action
      to attempt to damage one of the creatures limbs; the creature must succeed
      at a Fortitude save or have one of its limbs damaged by you (arms, legs,
      tentacles, or wings), ending the grapple. The penalties for a damaged limb
      are identical to the effects of a removed limb from the Limb Ripper talent
      except as follows:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The creature suffers no bleed damage.</li>

      <li>Any numerical penalties associated with the limb are halved.</li>

      <li>The condition lasts for 1 round plus 1 round per 4 points of base
      attack bonus you possess.</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Undead are not immune to this effect and must
      make the saving throw.</p>
