      <p>You can use brutal strike with thrown weapons. Additionally, throwing
      two-handed weapons no longer takes a full-round action, instead taking the
      same time as any other thrown weapon attack. When you expend your martial
      focus as part of a brutal strike, you can treat any melee weapon wielded
      by you that you&#8217;re proficient with as a thrown weapon with a range
      increment of 10 feet for that action. <strong>Associated Feats:</strong>
