      <p>You may change direction up to 90 degrees once at any point during a
      charge or while taking the run action. For every 7 ranks in Acrobatics you
      possess, the number of times you may change direction during a charge
      increases by 1, to a total maximum of 3 times. You still must be able to
      see the target of your charge when you begin the charge action.</p>
