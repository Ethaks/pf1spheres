      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scout Sphere (Deadly Strike), Stealth
      10 ranks.</p>

      <p>Whenever you attempt an attack action against a creature that is
      unaware of your presence and you have successfully used the scout ability
      against them, you may ignore any immunities to critical hits or precision
      damage they possess (this includes percentage chances to negate such
      effects, such as fortification), and all precision damage you deal to the
      target is maximized if the attack is a critical hit.</p>

      <p>Additionally, if the creature would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points
      due to the attack, it is instantly killed and transformed into fine dust,
      in addition to making no audible noise due to the attack if they are
      killed in this way (Fortitude negates). Regardless of the success of the
      attack, the creature gains immunity against this ability for 24 hours.
      This is a supernatural effect.</p>

      <p>A creature does not need to know your exact location to count as being
      aware of your presence, just to be aware that you are nearby.</p>
