      <p>You are practiced at quickly collecting a deep breath, drawing in more
      air in less time. You gain a circumstance bonus on any save against an
      effect that requires inhalation or causes suffocation equal to your half
      your ranks in Acrobatics or Swim (whichever is higher).</p>

      <p>If you possess the (run) package, you treat your Constitution score as
      being twice what it actually is for the purposes of determining how many
      rounds you can run without resting. This multiplier increases by 1 (x3,
      x4, etc.) for every 4 ranks in either Acrobatics or Swim you possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (swim) package, you treat your Constitution score as
      being twice what it actually is for the purposes of determining how long
      you can hold your breath. This multiplier increases by 1 (x3, x4, etc.)
      for every 4 ranks in Acrobatics or Swim you possess.</p>
