    value: >
      <p>When using an attack action, attack of opportunity, or additional
      attack granted by class features or talents to make a ranged attack
      against a creature with a thrown weapon, you may apply extra spin to the
      throw, causing the weapon to bounce back towards you after the attack
      resolves. As long as you have at least one hand free, you may
      automatically catch a weapon after it rebounds in this manner, otherwise
      the weapon lands in your square (or the nearest legal square beneath you
      if you are flying, levitating, or otherwise not standing on the
      ground).</p>
