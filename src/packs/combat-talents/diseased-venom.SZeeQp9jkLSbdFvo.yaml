    value: >
      <p>You may create a poison that causes the target to contract a disease
      (Fortitude negates). The disease is chosen at the time of creation,
      selected from the following diseases: bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth
      fever, leprosy, mind fire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom. The disease is
      contracted immediately (the onset period does not apply), and uses your
      Alchemy sphere save DC instead of the disease&#8217;s DC. This toxin is
      considered to be a disease instead of a poison.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> With GM discretion, you may select a
      different disease at the time of creation, instead of the diseases
      listed.</p>
