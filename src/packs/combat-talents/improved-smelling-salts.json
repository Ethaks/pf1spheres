      "value": "<p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 20</p>\n<p>You create a bottle of smelling salts that becomes incredible odorous when exposed to open air. This bottle can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. Creatures within a 10-foot radius burst of the point of contact immediately wake up, even if the creature is unconscious due to being below 0 hit points. This means that a dying creature can be made conscious again, although the creature is still dying and disabled, meaning that the creature must still make stabilization checks, and becomes unconscious again if they perform a strenuous action, unless they stabilize themselves. If a creature would be asleep due to magical means, you must succeed a magical skill check (using your ranks in Craft (alchemy) instead of MSB) against the sleep effect&#8217;s MSD for this formulae to have effect. Additionally, creatures within the radius gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against sleep effects for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; each time you do so, the radius increases by 10 feet and the bonus on saving throws against sleep effects increases by 2.</p>\n",
