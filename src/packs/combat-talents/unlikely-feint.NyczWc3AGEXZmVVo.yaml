      <p>You do not suffer a penalty when feinting against non-humanoids, and
      the penalty against feinting a creature with an Intelligence of 1 or 2 is
      reduced to -4. You may attempt to feint mindless creatures, but suffer a
      -8 penalty. For every 5 points of base attack bonus you possess, these
      penalties are reduced by 2 (minimum 0).</p>
