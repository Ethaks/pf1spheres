      <p>Whenever you attempt to attack a creature with your counter punch, you
      may expend your martial focus as a free action that can be taken even when
      it is not your turn to treat the target of your attack as being
      flat-footed until the end of that turn and give the creature the battered
      condition until the end of your next turn on a successful hit.</p>
