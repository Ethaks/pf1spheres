      <p>While in this stance, whenever you damage a creature with an attack
      action, you may remove an amount of damage from your delayed damage pool
      equal to the damage dealt by your attack, up to a maximum of your base
      attack bonus.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> This ability only removes hit point
      damage from your delayed pool. It cannot automatically cure conditions,
      spell effects, ability damage, and other things you may be storing in
      it.</sup></p>
