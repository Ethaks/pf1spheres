      <p>A creature that fails its Reflex save to avoid this snare may not move
      from its current location unless it succeeds on a Strength or Escape
      Artist check against the trap&#8217;s DC or destroys the trap via damage.
      The affected creature also takes 1 bleed damage for every 8 ranks in Craft
      (traps) you possess (minimum 1). Treat this as an attack action performed
      by you for the purposes of Duelist sphere talents, such as dealing extra
      bleed damage, or determining which creatures are affected by this bleed
      (including (bleed) talents when applicable).</p>
