      <p>You can use your trained senses to read the movements of the wind and
      other factors in the environment to improve your accuracy with ranged
      attacks. As long as you have martial focus, you may spend a swift action
      to halve the penalties to ranged attacks inflicted by wind, rain, or other
      weather in regard to your next ranged attack, made before the end of your
      turn.</p>
