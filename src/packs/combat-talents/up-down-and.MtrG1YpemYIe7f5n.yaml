    value: >
      <p>While you have the drunk status, you eliminate the penalties to your
      armor class and melee attacks while prone. Additionally, if you strike an
      enemy while prone, and then attack them again within one round while
      standing (or vice versa), you can expend your martial focus to target
      their flat-footed armor class for the second attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you possess the Capoeira Spin talent from
      the Open Hand sphere, you always eliminate all penalties from being prone
      rather than only when drunk, and you can stand up without provoking
      attacks of opportunity as a free action made as part of an attack action
      while you have the drunk status, rather than an immediate action. At +10
      base attack bonus, you instead gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made while
      prone.</p>
