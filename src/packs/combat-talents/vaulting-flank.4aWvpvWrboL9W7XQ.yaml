    value: >
      <p>When using the attack action to attack, your mount may also attack your
      target with a single natural weapon it possesses as a joint swift action.
      If both you and the mount successfully deal damage with these attacks, you
      may command your mount to buck you into a vaulting dismount over your foe
      and into a flanking position with your mount against that creature. You
      must succeed on a Ride check (DC 15 + 5 per size category larger than your
      mount the creature is), or you instead fall prone adjacent to your mount.
      Your mount will continue to attack that creature as long as they remain
      conscious, or until you remount and give them a new command.</p>
