    value: >
      <p>You may perform the trip combat maneuver against swimming creatures. If
      you succeed, instead of making the target prone you make them
      off-balanced. An off-balance creature loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor
      Class, and opponents gain a +2 bonus on attacks against it as long as it
      remains in water. Treat this as if you had made the creature prone for
      abilities that depend on knocking down or targetting a prone creature. The
      off-balanced creature may right itself as a move action that provokes
      attacks of opportunity. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Sea Hunter.</p>
