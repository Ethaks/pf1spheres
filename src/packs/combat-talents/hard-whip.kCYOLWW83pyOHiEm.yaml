      <p>You may end the grapple to force the grappled creature to move up to 10
      ft. in a direction of your choice except upwards. This movement does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity, although if the creature&#8217;s
      movement would force them to enter one of your ally&#8217;s squares, they
      provoke an attack of opportunity from that ally and their movement is
      stopped before entering that ally&#8217;s square (if two or more of your
      allies share the same square, only a single ally of your choice may make
      an attack of opportunity due to this talent); for every 5 ft. the creature
      was forced to travel, your ally&#8217;s attack of opportunity gains a +2
      circumstance bonus to damage. If this movement would cause a creature to
      collide with a solid object, they take damage equal to 1d6 + the modifier
      of the attribute used to determine your combat maneuver bonus for the
      maneuver. This damage is increased by +1d6 for every 5-ft. square the
      target would have traveled beyond the wall or object.</p>

      <p>You may choose to use this talent on an ally; if you do, that ally may
      make a melee attack any point during this movement, and may choose to end
      this movement whenever they wish. For every 5 ft. your ally travels before
      making this attack, they gain a +2 circumstance bonus to this
      attack&#8217;s damage roll. For every 4 points of base attack bonus you
      possess, the distance you can force a creature to move with this talent
      increases by 5 ft.</p>
