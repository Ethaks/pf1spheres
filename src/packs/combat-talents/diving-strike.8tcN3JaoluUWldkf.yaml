      <p>You may charge an enemy by rapidly descending from above them (such as
      when jumping out of a tree or deliberately entering a fall while flying or
      gliding). You may fly above the target or use the Acrobatics skill to leap
      as part of this charge.</p>

      <p>If the attack at the end of your charge hits, the attack deals damage
      as normal and also adds the appropriate amount of falling damage (1d6
      points for a 10-ft. fall, 2d6 points for a 20-ft. fall, and so on), to
      your damage roll, to a maximum of 1d6 per rank in Acrobatics or Fly
      (whichever is higher) you possess. This falling damage is not multiplied
      on a critical hit. After the attack is resolved, you land in an unoccupied
      square of your choosing adjacent to the target, and you take falling
      damage as if you had fallen 10 fewer ft.</p>

      <p>You can attempt an Acrobatics check as normal to treat the fall as
      being shorter for the purpose of determining the damage you take from the
      fall, and you treat the first 1d6 points of damage you take from the fall
      as nonlethal damage. If your attack misses, you land prone in a random
      square adjacent to the target and automatically take the full amount of
      falling damage. If you are subject to an ability or effect that negates or
      reduces falling damage (other than the normal Acrobatics check to reduce
      fall height), such as the feather fall spell or the boots of the cat, your
      bonus damage dice from this talent are also negated or reduced in a
      similar fashion. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Branch Pounce.</p>
