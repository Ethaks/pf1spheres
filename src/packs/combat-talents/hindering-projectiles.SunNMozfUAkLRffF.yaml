    value: >
      <p>Your successful deadly shot leaves the weapon or ammunition used for
      the attack lodged in the wound, making it difficult for the target to move
      and react. The target takes a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and CMD;
      multiple uses of this ability stack, increasing the penalty by an
      additional -2 per projectile lodged in the target. The target may remove a
      single projectile as a move action, or may remove multiple as a full-round
      action.</p>
