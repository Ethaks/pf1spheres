      <p>Your ranged attacks are launched with devastating accuracy; whenever
      you make a ranged attack using the attack action and a spell or ability
      (such as wind wall or the Deflect Arrows feat) would allow a creature to
      prevent or deflect it, that creature must succeed at a caster level check
      (if the blocking effect is a spell or supernatural ability) or a combat
      maneuver check against your attack roll. Failure on this check means that
      your attack is not impeded by the ability.</p>
