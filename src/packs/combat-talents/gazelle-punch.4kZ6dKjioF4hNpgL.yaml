      <p>Whenever you ready a counter punch, you treat your reach as though it
      was 5 ft. further for the purposes of being able to make a counter punch.
      If the triggering action was taken by a creature that is outside of your
      normal reach, you may move to a square that places the creature within
      your reach (this movement does provoke attacks of opportunity) before
      making the attack. At +10 base attack bonus, your effective reach
      increases by an additional 5 ft. (up to your speed).</p>
