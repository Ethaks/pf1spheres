    value: >
      <p>Whenever a creature within your threatened area misses you with a melee
      attack, you may expend your martial focus to perform a trip attempt
      against that creature as an immediate action that does not provoke an
      attack of opportunity. If the creature&#8217;s attack roll was penalized
      by an ability such as Power Attack, that creature&#8217;s CMD to resist
      this trip attempt suffers an equal penalty.</p>
