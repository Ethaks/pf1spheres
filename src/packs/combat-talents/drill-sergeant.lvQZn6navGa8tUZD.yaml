    value: >
      <p>You may increase the power of a cohort through intense training. You
      may grant a cohort creature 1 bonus Hit Die for every hour you spend
      training it with a Diplomacy check with a DC of 10 + the creature&#8217;s
      new Hit Dice total.</p>

      <p>These additional Hit Dice count against your Hit Dice cap for the
      recruit ability as normal and cannot cause the creature&#8217;s Hit Dice
      to exceed the maximum shown on Table: Cohort. If a cohort is released,
      these bonus Hit Dice are lost at a rate of 1 per week. Additional feats
      and skill points from these Hit Dice are assigned by you.</p>

      <p>You may retrain feats and skill ranks possessed by cohort. You may
      retrain one feat, talent, or a number of skill ranks equal to your ranks
      in Diplomacy with 4 hours of training. The new feats and skills must be
      appropriate for the cohort; cohorts may not gain casting abilities. The GM
      is the final arbiter of what feats and skills are suitable. With 8 hours
      of training, you may instead retrain a number of feats equal to half your
      ranks in Diplomacy (minimum 2 feats).</p>

      <p>You may recruit 1 Hit Die cohorts from your followers. You may recruit
      a number of cohorts not exceeding your practitioner ability modifier
      (minimum 1) this way each week.</p>
