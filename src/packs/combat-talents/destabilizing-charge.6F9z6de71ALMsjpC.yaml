    value: >
      <p>When you perform a charge and successfully hit a creature, the creature
      loses their Dexterity bonus to their AC against the next attack roll made
      against them before the end of your next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Distracting Charge.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This talent only works on the first
      successful attack made as part of a charge. Pounce, or similar abilities,
      do not allow you to affect a creature with this talent multiple times.</p>
