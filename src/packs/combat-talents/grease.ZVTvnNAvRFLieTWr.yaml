      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 20</p>

      <p>You create a flask of alchemical grease that can be applied to yourself
      or a willing creature within your reach as a move action, or thrown as a
      splash weapon. When applied to a willing creature, they gain a +5
      circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks, and to CMB checks to escape a
      grapple. When thrown as a splash weapon, creatures directly hit by the
      attack take a -2 penalty to Acrobatics checks, CMD against disarm and trip
      attempts, and to Reflex saving throws against effects that deal fire
      damage or which cause a creature to catch fire on a failed saving throw;
      creatures within the splash radius of the weapon take the same penalties
      but reduce them by 50% (rounded down). In addition, any creature affected
      by this alchemical grease who falls prone must succeed on an Acrobatics
      check with a DC equal to the practitioner&#8217;s combat talent save DC
      when standing up or immediately fall prone again. A creature may end this
      effect by spending a standard action removing the grease.</p>

      <p>This grease remains for 2 rounds. You can increase the Craft DC of this
      alchemical by 5 to increase the duration of the grease&#8217;s effects for
      2 additional rounds, or to increase the bonuses and penalties granted by
      the alchemical grease by 1. You can apply both modifications to the same
      vial of grease but must apply the DC increases separately for each effect
      (so increasing the grease&#8217;s duration by 2 rounds and increasing the
      bonuses and penalties by 1 requires a total modification to the crafting
      DC of +10).</p>
