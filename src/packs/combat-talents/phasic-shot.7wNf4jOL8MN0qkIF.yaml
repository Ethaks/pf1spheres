      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sniper sphere, Perfect Shot, base
      attack bonus +15.</p>

      <p>Your shot is fired with such force and deadly accuracy that it cuts
      through the very bonds of reality, bypassing any obstacle between it and
      its target. Targets gain no benefit from cover, even total cover, against
      your attacks. If you possess the Star Scraper legendary talent, you may
      attack a target anywhere within its advanced range, even if they are
      completely enclosed by protective surfaces, though you must still have a
      reliable means of ascertaining your target&#8217;s exact location. This is
      a supernatural effect.</p>
