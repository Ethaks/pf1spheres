      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Equipment sphere, Lancer sphere, Ranged
      Impale, proficiency with grappling hook, harpoon, or rope dart.</p>

      <p>Whenever you successfully impale a creature with a ranged attack using
      a grappling hook, harpoon, rope dart, or another weapon attached to a
      rope, you may attempt a drag combat maneuver as a free action which does
      not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

      <p>If this attempt is successful, the creature is dragged into a square
      adjacent to you as long as there is an unobstructed path between yourself
      and the creature (this talent fails if you are not standing on solid
      ground as well as if there is not enough solid ground adjacent to you to
      accommodate the creature you are repositioning, and this movement does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity).</p>
