      <p>When performing a barrage, you may make 2 extra attacks instead of one,
      but must target the same creature with both of these extra attacks.
      However, your shots are wild, and the target can easily duck, causing both
      of your extra attacks to miss. However, doing so causes the target to have
      its movement speed reduced by half and to suffer a -3 penalty to
      Perception checks and to all attack rolls until the end of their next
      round, -1 for each additional extra attack augmented with the suppressing
      fire (blitz) that targets this creature. The target can choose not to
      avoid these attacks, in which case you may roll the attacks as normal, and
      the target doesn&#8217;t suffer the penalties.</p>
