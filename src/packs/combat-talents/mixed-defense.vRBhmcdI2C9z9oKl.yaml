    value: >
      <p>Whenever you wield a melee weapon in one hand and a ranged weapon in
      the other, you may forgo your ranged attack when using the dual attack
      ability. If you do so, until your next turn, you may spend an attack of
      opportunity to make a ranged attack against an opponent attempting to
      attack you in melee. If your ranged attack hits, you gain a +2 dodge bonus
      to AC against that opponent and a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls
      against that opponent until the end of your next turn. Both the melee
      weapon attack and the ranged attack suffer the attack penalty from dual
      attack as normal, and the ranged attack must be made with the same ranged
      weapon wielded during the dual attack.</p>
