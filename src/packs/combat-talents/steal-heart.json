      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere, Sleight of Hand 7 ranks.</p>\n<p>You may expend your martial focus to perform a steal combat maneuver as a full-round action. Rather than steal an object, you may force the target to make a successful Will saving throw or have their attitude towards you improved to friendly for a number of minutes equal to your ranks in Sleight of Hand. If the target is in combat, is already hostile to you, or is aware you are using this ability, they gain a +5 bonus to this saving throw. This is a spell-like, mind-altering (charm) effect.</p>\n<p>You may only have a number of creatures charmed at a time equal to your practitioner modifier; if you attempt to charm another, the creature you have had charmed for the longest is no longer charmed. Once a creature has been affected by or made a saving throw against this talent, they cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>You may only affect creatures who share your creature type with this talent. When you possess 10 or more ranks in Sleight of Hand, you may target any creature regardless of creature type (except for those immune to such abilities).</p>\n",
