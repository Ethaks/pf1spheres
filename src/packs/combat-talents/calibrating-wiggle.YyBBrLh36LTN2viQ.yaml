    value: >
      <p>Whenever you spend a swift action and successfully scout a target, you
      may move up to 1/2 your movement speed, provided that your movement ends
      in a space further away from the scouted target. This movement provokes
      attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use this talent to move further away from a scouted
      target, if you perform a charge action against that scouted target before
      the end of your next turn, your first successful attack deals additional
      precision damage equal to 1/2 your ranks in Perception (minimum 1). This
      additional precision damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>
