    value: >
      <p>You may choose for your poison to not cause fatigue, but instead to
      enhance the physical aptitude of those subjected to it (this talent cannot
      be used with a contact or inhaled poison). Those who are under the effects
      of this poison gain a +2 alchemical bonus to either their Strength,
      Dexterity, or Constitution (chosen upon creation) and a -2 penalty to one
      of the creature&#8217;s mental scores for 1 minute. If this enhances the
      creature&#8217;s Strength, it applies a penalty to their Intelligence. If
      it enhances the creature&#8217;s Dexterity, it applies a penalty to their
      Wisdom. If it enhances the creature&#8217;s Constitution, it applies a
      penalty to their Charisma. At the end of this talent&#8217;s duration, the
      creature must make a successful Fortitude save or be sickened for 10
      minutes. If you possess at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy), this bonus
      increases by +2. A creature cannot benefit from a Performance Enhancer
      more than once per hour.</p>
