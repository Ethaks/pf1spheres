      <p>As a standard action, you may choose an area with a 5-ft. radius. This
      area must be within your first range increment. You threaten this area
      until the beginning of your next turn, and may make attacks of opportunity
      using a ranged weapon that you are wielding against any creature in this
      area that provokes them. If the weapon uses ammunition, it must either be
      loaded or you must be able to load it as a free action and thrown weapons
      must be in hand or able to be drawn as a free action to make these attacks
      of opportunity. For every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess, this
      radius increases by 5 ft.</p>
