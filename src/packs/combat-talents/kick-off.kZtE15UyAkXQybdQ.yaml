      <p>Whenever you make a successful attack with an unarmed strike using an
      attack action, you may spend a swift action to move 10 ft. away from the
      target of your attack. This movement does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity from the target of your attack. For every 5 points of base
      attack bonus you possess, you may move an additional 5 ft. with this
      talent.</p>
