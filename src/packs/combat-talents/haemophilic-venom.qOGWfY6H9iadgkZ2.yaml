    value: >
      <p>Instead of causing fatigue, your poison thins the target&#8217;s blood
      greatly. Creatures under the effects of this poison suffer 1 additional
      point of bleed damage whenever they would take bleed damage. For every 4
      ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess, creatures suffer 1 additional point
      of bleed damage. Additionally, whenever the creature would suffer a
      critical hit, the creature suffers an additional 1d4 points of bleed
      damage.</p>

      <p>A creature under the effects of this poison is also considered to be
      taking bleed damage for the purposes of the blood control sphere ability
      of the Blood sphere.</p>
