    value: >
      <p>You add your practitioner ability modifier to the Survival check your
      caravan makes to subsist in the wilderness. You may increase your overland
      travel speed with your caravan to 6 miles per hour and can travel 64 miles
      a day.</p>

      <p>Instead of increasing your speed, you can have your followers map the
      surrounding area, allowing them to map a 6 mile hex you pass through each
      day. This improves by one additional hex for every 3 ranks in Diplomacy
      you possess.</p>

      <p>Your followers may find and capture animals as well. Your followers can
      supply 1 Hit Die of creatures of the animal type per rank in Diplomacy
      each day, though are limited to animals present in their surroundings.
      They may assist a PC that attempts to tame (as the Beastmastery sphere)
      one of these creatures, reducing the time required to 1 hour.</p>

      <p>Any Handle Animal and Survival checks made while with the followers
      automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus from the rangers&#8217; aid.
      This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you
      possess.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Goods capital in place of earning gold, with 10 gp equaling 1
      Good. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This
      stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>
