      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Acrobatics 5 ranks, Athletics sphere
      (Armored Drop x2).</p>

      <p>Your armor&#8217;s hardness applies to, and is doubled against, the
      damage suffered from the Armored Drop talent.</p>

      <p>In addition, when using the Armored Drop talent you may expend your
      martial focus to increase the damage dealt to the amount of damage that
      would be dealt to your armor before hardness. In addition the damage now
      affects everything in a 5-foot radius + 5 feet per 5 ranks in Acrobatics
      you possess. The damage dealt by this talent is doubled vs. objects, and
      if the damage would be enough to destroy the surface underneath you, you
      continue to fall, subtracting the damage dealt to the surface from the
      damage dealt by this talent to later surfaces.</p>
