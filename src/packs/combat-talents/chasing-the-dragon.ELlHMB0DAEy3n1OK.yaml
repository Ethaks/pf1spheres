      <p>You may consume a drug or stimulant instead of imbibing an alcoholic
      drink to gain the drunk status, but you gain the status for double the
      duration (twice Constitution modifier rounds + 1 per 2 points of base
      attack bonus). When using hard drinker or any other ability that allows
      you to rapidly take a drink, you may consume a drug or stimulant instead
      of a drink (this counts as consuming a stimulant rapidly). You may ignore
      the negative effects of the drug or addiction so long as you retain the
      drunk status.</p>
