      <p>You gain a +2 competence bonus to ranged trip attempts made with bolas
      or brutal bolas. Whenever you use bolas or brutal bolas to make a
      successful ranged trip attack as an attack action, you may also deal
      damage to the target as if the trip attempt had been a standard ranged
      attack with that weapon.</p>
