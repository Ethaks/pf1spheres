      <p>You may call your allies to arms and give them the strength to push
      through exhaustion. For the shout&#8217;s duration, you and your affected
      allies may ignore the penalties associated with the fatigued or exhausted
      conditions. This does not end those conditions nor allow an exhausted
      creature to use the Roaring Reservoir talent, it simply removes the
      penalties associated with those conditions for the time being.</p>
