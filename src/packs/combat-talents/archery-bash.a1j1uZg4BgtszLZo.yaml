      <p>You are considered proficient with using a bow, crossbow, or firearm as
      an improvised melee weapon, and any enhancement bonus to these weapons
      applies to your attack and damage rolls while using them as an improvised
      weapon. You suffer no penalty to attacks with these weapons due to using
      them as an improvised weapon, provoke no attacks of opportunity when using
      them as a melee weapon, and threaten the area around you as you normally
      would when wielding a melee weapon.</p>
