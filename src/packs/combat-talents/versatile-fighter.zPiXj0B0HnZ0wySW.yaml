      <p>This talent gives you access to three stances, listed below. Feats that
      list the associated feats as prerequisites only work while the stances
      that grant the associated feats are active.</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Offensive Style:</strong> While in this stance, you gain the
      benefit of the Deadly Aim and Power Attack feats. Additionally, when you
      successfully damage a creature with an attack action modified by Deadly
      Aim or Power Attack, that creature becomes battered for 1 round.
      <strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Deadly Aim, Power Attack.</li>

      <li><strong>Defensive Style:</strong> While in this stance, you gain the
      benefit of the Combat Expertise feat. Additionally, when you successfully
      damage a creature with an attack action modified by Combat Expertise,
      increase the dodge bonus to armor class granted by Combat Expertise by 1,
      +1 per 10 base attack bonus you possess, until the end of your next turn.
      This increase does not stack with itself. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Combat Expertise.</li>

      <li><strong>Recovery Style:</strong> While in this stance, you gain the
      benefit of the Heroic Resolve feat. Additionally, when you successfully
      damage a creature with an attack action while in this stance, your next
      activation of Heroic Resolve until the end of your next turn does not
      require expenditure of your martial focus. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Heroic Resolve.</li>
