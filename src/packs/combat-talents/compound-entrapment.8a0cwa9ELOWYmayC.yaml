      <p>Whenever you would be allowed a free action grapple attempt against a
      creature you are already grappling (such as when you hit with an attack
      using the grab special attack), you may instead choose to increase the
      target&#8217;s penalties for grappling by 2 for 1 round. This increased
      penalty stacks with itself, to a maximum of half your base attack bonus
      (minimum 2).</p>
