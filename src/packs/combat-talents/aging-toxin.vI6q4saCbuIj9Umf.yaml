      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Craft (alchemy) 10 ranks, Alchemy
      sphere.</p>

      <p>You may choose for your poison to begin to aggressively age the
      creature, increasing their age category by 1 instead of making them
      fatigued. For each time the creature fails a consecutive saving throw
      against this poison, it increases their age by 1 additional category. This
      poison does not add or remove bonuses to mental ability scores. This
      poison cannot cause the target to die of old age. The effects of different
      age categories are cumulative. The effects of this toxin are permanent,
      but can be removed with the Break Enchantment Life talent, or a similar
      effect.</p>
