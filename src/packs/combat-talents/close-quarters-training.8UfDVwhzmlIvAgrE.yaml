    value: >
      <p>You can move into the space of another creature. You may end your
      movement in, and make attacks from, that space. You must succeed at the
      Acrobatics check for moving through an occupied square to move into a
      space occupied by an enemy; if you fail, your movement stops in the
      previous space and you provoke an attack of opportunity. Attacks made
      against a creature sharing your space in this way take a -4 penalty unless
      they are made with light or natural weapons. If two creatures sharing a
      space in this way are of the same size, they grant each other soft cover
      from all attack made by creatures not sharing the space. If one creature
      is larger, the smaller creature gains concealment (20% miss chance)
      against attacks made by creatures not sharing the space. Should this
      concealment cause an attack to miss, resolve the attack against the larger
      creature.</p>
