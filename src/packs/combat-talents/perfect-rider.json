      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Beastmastery sphere ((ride) package), Mounted Athlete.</p>\n<p>While mounted, you may share any effect that allows you to move or alters how you move (such as a talent, feat, class feature, or other effect) with your mount, provided your mount could benefit from the effect normally. If a movement effect requires you to attempt a check (such as a skill check or ability check), you attempt that check for both you and your mount.</p>\n<p>If an effect you share with your mount affects another creature, that creature is only affected once.</p>\n<p>Whenever you use an ability that would allow you to move, you may allow your mount to move using that ability as a joint action. Use your mount&#8217;s movement speed and movement modes when determining any variables, distances, or limitations for that movement (an effect that says &#8220;half your movement speed&#8221; would use your mount&#8217;s movement rather than your own, and an effect which requires you to burrow or fly could not be used by your mount unless it could burrow or fly). Both you and your mount must spend the required action to take advantage of the movement effect as a joint action, if an action is required to benefit from that effect. Both you and your mount are treated as having used that effect for any usage limitations, benefits, or penalties associated with the movement granted by that ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Note and Example:</strong> This legendary talent allows a mounted character to share any and all of their abilities which enhance, rely, or grant additional movement with their mount, subject to GM discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, the following examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Class features (monk&#8217;s fast movement)</li>\n<li>Feats (Fleet, Nimble Moves)</li>\n<li>Sphere abilities (such as Brute sphere shove)</li>\n<li>Combat sphere talents (Fencing sphere Footwork talent, Scoundrel sphere Cut And Run talent, or Scout sphere Unimpeded Positioning talent)</li>\n<li>Magic sphere talents (Destruction sphere Energy Leap talent)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GMs should review the implications of this talent and characters having full and unabridged synergy between non-mounted and mounted movement options.</p>\n<p>This legendary talent does not include teleportation effects as a &#8220;movement effect&#8221; unless the rider possesses the Dimensional Athlete Champion feat or another effect that allows them to treat teleportation effects as a movement mode with the Athletics sphere.</p>\n",
