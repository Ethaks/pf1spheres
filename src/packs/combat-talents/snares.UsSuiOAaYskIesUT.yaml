      <p>A snare trap is constructed from rope, wire, and similar materials. A
      snare targets the first creature to enter one of the squares it occupies.
      A creature may avoid triggering a snare with a successful Reflex save;
      doing so leaves the trap untriggered and makes the creature aware of the
      trap and able to pass through that trap&#8217;s space(s) without further
      risk of triggering it. Some talents grant additional types of snares. Each
      trap may only benefit from one (snare) talent.</p>

      <p>An alchemical item may be rigged to a snare trap. If a creature
      triggers the trap, the alchemical item is activated, targeting a grid
      intersection adjacent to the trap chosen when it is set. If the alchemical
      item is a thrown splash weapon, the triggering creature is affected by the
      item as if it were struck directly by it. Other small items such as dyes,
      dusts, vials of perfume, and other items with GM permission may also be
      attached to a snare trap as well.</p>

      <p>An inhaled poison may be rigged to a snare trap. If a creature triggers
      the trap, the first square entered (the creature&#8217;s choice if there
      is more than one entered simultaneously) becomes the centerpoint for the
      inhaled poison.</p>

      <p>When you first gain the Trap sphere, you gain the following snare:</p>
