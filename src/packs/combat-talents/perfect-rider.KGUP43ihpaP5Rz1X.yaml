      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Beastmastery sphere
      ((ride) package), Mounted Athlete.</p>

      <p>While mounted, you may share any effect that allows you to move or
      alters how you move (such as a talent, feat, class feature, or other
      effect) with your mount, provided your mount could benefit from the effect
      normally. If a movement effect requires you to attempt a check (such as a
      skill check or ability check), you attempt that check for both you and
      your mount.</p>

      <p>If an effect you share with your mount affects another creature, that
      creature is only affected once.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use an ability that would allow you to move, you may allow
      your mount to move using that ability as a joint action. Use your
      mount&#8217;s movement speed and movement modes when determining any
      variables, distances, or limitations for that movement (an effect that
      says &#8220;half your movement speed&#8221; would use your mount&#8217;s
      movement rather than your own, and an effect which requires you to burrow
      or fly could not be used by your mount unless it could burrow or fly).
      Both you and your mount must spend the required action to take advantage
      of the movement effect as a joint action, if an action is required to
      benefit from that effect. Both you and your mount are treated as having
      used that effect for any usage limitations, benefits, or penalties
      associated with the movement granted by that ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Note and Example:</strong> This legendary talent allows a
      mounted character to share any and all of their abilities which enhance,
      rely, or grant additional movement with their mount, subject to GM
      discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, the following
      examples:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Class features (monk&#8217;s fast movement)</li>

      <li>Feats (Fleet, Nimble Moves)</li>

      <li>Sphere abilities (such as Brute sphere shove)</li>

      <li>Combat sphere talents (Fencing sphere Footwork talent, Scoundrel
      sphere Cut And Run talent, or Scout sphere Unimpeded Positioning
      talent)</li>

      <li>Magic sphere talents (Destruction sphere Energy Leap talent)</li>

      </ul>

      <p>GMs should review the implications of this talent and characters having
      full and unabridged synergy between non-mounted and mounted movement
      options.</p>

      <p>This legendary talent does not include teleportation effects as a
      &#8220;movement effect&#8221; unless the rider possesses the Dimensional
      Athlete Champion feat or another effect that allows them to treat
      teleportation effects as a movement mode with the Athletics sphere.</p>
