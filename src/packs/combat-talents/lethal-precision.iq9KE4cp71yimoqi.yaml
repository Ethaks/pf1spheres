      <p>After performing a deadly shot made while hiding, you may use the
      Stealth skill&#8217;s sniping function as a swift action. You may expend
      martial focus to reduce this to a free action. In addition, when making a
      deadly shot, you can deal Fencing sphere precision damage, sneak attack
      damage, or damage from other similar effects and abilities at any
      distance.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Using Stealth immediately after a ranged
      attack is a move action.</p>
