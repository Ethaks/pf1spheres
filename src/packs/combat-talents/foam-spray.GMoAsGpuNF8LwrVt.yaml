    value: >
      <p>When triggered, this trap sprays a fluid that hardens on contact with
      air, filling the space of the trap to a height of 5 ft. with an opaque
      foam. This height increases by 5 ft. for every 5 ranks in Craft (traps)
      you possess. Creatures occupying a space filled with foam are entangled
      until they succeed on a Strength or Escape Artist check with a DC equal to
      the trap&#8217;s DC or the foam is destroyed. Alchemical foam has a
      hardness of 0 and each 5-ft. cube has hit points equal to your ranks in
      Craft (traps) x3.</p>
