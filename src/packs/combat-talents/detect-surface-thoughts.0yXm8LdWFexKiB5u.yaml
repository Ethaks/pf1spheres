      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scout sphere, Perception 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>Once you have scouted a creature, you can attempt to discern their
      surface thoughts. Each round you may spend a standard action concentrating
      to gain more information on what a creature is thinking:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>1st Round:</strong> Presence or absence of thoughts (from
      conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher).</li>

      <li><strong>2nd Round:</strong> The Intelligence score of your scouted
      target. If its Intelligence is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher
      than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round.</li>

      <li><strong>3rd Round:</strong> Surface thoughts of the target. Creatures
      of animal intelligence (Intelligence 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual
      thoughts.</li>

      </ul>
