    value: >
      <p>You push your stature into a more compact space, guarding yourself
      against incoming ranged attacks and giving you more time to react. You do
      not provide soft cover to creatures when ranged attacks pass through your
      square. As long as you have martial focus, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC
      against ranged attacks, increasing by +1 for every 7 base attack bonus you
      possess. In addition, once per round when you would normally be hit with
      an attack from a ranged weapon, you may expend martial focus to evade the
      projectile so you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack
      and not flat-footed.</p>

      <p>Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as a boulder or ballista bolts)
      and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects cannot be
      evaded.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Deflect Arrows, Low Profile.</p>
