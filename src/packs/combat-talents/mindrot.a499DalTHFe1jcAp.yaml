      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere.</p>

      <p>When you create a poison you may have it be resisted by Will saving
      throws instead of Fortitude saving throws (the effect is still treated as
      a Fortitude saving throw for the purposes of racial immunities and
      resistances). This is chosen at the time of its creation.</p>
