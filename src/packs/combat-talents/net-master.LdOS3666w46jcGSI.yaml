      <p>You take no penalties for using a net that has not been folded and
      apply any enhancement bonus to attack rolls that the net possesses to all
      your Strength checks against a creature entangled by the net, and to the
      DC of Strength checks to burst your nets. You add half your base attack
      bonus to the escape artist DC to escape your nets.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you may make drag and reposition attempts against
      creatures entangled by your nets as long as you control the trailing rope.
      You may add any enhancement bonus to attack rolls that the net possesses
      on these combat maneuver checks. This talent applies to any weapon that
      functions as a net, such as the lasso (as applicable) and snag net.</p>
