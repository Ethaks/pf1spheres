      <p>You are accurate enough to follow one shot with another, striking the
      same spot for greater damage. If you strike a target twice during a
      barrage, only apply its damage reduction or hardness once, rather than
      individually to each attack. This stacks with each additional shot given
      this (blitz). In addition, your attacks deal full damage if the target is
      an object, rather than half.</p>
