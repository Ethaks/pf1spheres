    value: >
      <p>You may make a melee touch attack against a creature as a swift action;
      if this attack is successful, the creature is battered and takes a -1
      penalty on Perception checks for 1 round. For every 4 ranks in Sleight of
      Hand you possess, this penalty is increased by 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Trick:</strong> Whenever you perform a steal or dirty trick
      combat maneuver, or make a Sleight of Hand check to take an object from a
      target unnoticed, you may apply one (trick) talent to it. (Trick) talents
      cannot be applied to maneuvers performed as a free action.</p>
