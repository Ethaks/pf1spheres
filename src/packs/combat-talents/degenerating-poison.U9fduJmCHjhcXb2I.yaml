      <p>You may choose for your poison to inflict a penalty of -2 to one
      ability score of the target (except Constitution) instead of making the
      target fatigued. The penalties from multiple applications of Degenerating
      Poison stack. For every 5 Craft (alchemy) ranks you possess, you may
      increase the penalty of this poison by -2. You may apply all of this
      penalty to a single ability score, or divide it in units of -2 between
      multiple ability scores. You choose which ability scores receive
      penalties, and how the penalty is divided, when creating this poison.</p>
