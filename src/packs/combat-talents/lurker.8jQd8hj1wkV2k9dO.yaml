      <p>Creatures using unusual forms of sensory perception such as blindsight,
      greensight, or tremorsense cannot automatically foil your use of Stealth;
      such creatures must make a Perception check as normal to detect you when
      you make use of the Stealth skill.</p>

      <p>Lurker foils divination spells and <a href="/divination">Divination</a>
      sphere sense abilities in the manner described above, but has no effect on
      spell, sphere, spell-like, or supernatural abilities specifically used to
      uncover information about you rather than enhancing the user&#8217;s
      perception, such as when scrying or using the <a
      href="/divination">Divination</a> sphere&#8216;s divine abilities.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The Lurker talent protects against
      forms of perception, such as blindsight, greensight, or tremorsense, or
      other similar forms of vision which would pinpoint a creature and negate
      their use of Stealth. This does not include effects which would negate
      other things that allow you to stealth, such as true seeing or see
      invisibility.</p>

      <p>This extends to the Divination sphere, protecting against (sense)
      talents which provide effects similar to blindsight or blindsense (such as
      greensight, tremorsense, thoughtsense, spiritsense, touchsense, et. al).
      This talent does not protect against all (sense) talents, only those which
      provide forms of perception similar to blindsight or blindsense or would
      otherwise pinpoint a creature using Stealth.</p>
