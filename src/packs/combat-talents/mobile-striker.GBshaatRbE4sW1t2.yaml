    value: >
      <p>Your ability to twist and turn fluidly while moving allows you to take
      an attack action at any point during your movement. As a full-round
      action, you can move up to your speed and make a single attack action
      without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your
      attack for your movement. You can move both before and after the attack,
      but you must move at least 10 ft. using a movement mode associated with a
      package you possess before the attack and the total distance that you move
      cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a
      foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Spring Attack.</p>
