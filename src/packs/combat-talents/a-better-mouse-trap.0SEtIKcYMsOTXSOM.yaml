      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Craft (traps) 5 ranks, Trap sphere.</p>

      <p>When triggered, this trap releases a rat swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary
      pg. 232) in the square it was triggered. The swarm is hostile and attacks
      the creature which triggered the trap or any other nearby creature if
      unable to attack the target. A swarm summoned by this effect remains for 1
      minute per rank of Craft (traps) you possess before mysteriously
      disappearing. For every 10 ranks in Craft (traps) you possess, an
      additional swarm is released in the nearest adjacent square to the
      creature who triggered the trap.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Bee Keeper Beastmastery talent, you may expend
      martial focus when placing this trap to choose an animal or vermin swarm
      with a CR equal to or less than 1/2 your ranks in Craft (traps) to be
      released when the trap triggers. Choosing a swarm is subject to GM
      discretion.</p>
