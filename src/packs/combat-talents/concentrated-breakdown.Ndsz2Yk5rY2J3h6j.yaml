    value: >
      <p>Whenever you deal damage to a creature with two or more weapons in a
      single round, you can select either that creature&#8217;s natural armor
      bonus or damage reduction; reduce it by 2 (to a minimum of 0) for 1 minute
      or until that creature recovers hit points from any source. If you would
      be able to apply the effects of this talent to the same creature 2 or more
      times before its duration is over, you can either choose to reduce
      whichever target (natural armor or damage reduction) that you did not
      select before or increase the reduction by 1 as well as reset the
      duration. At +10 base attack bonus, whenever you apply the effects of this
      talent to a creature, if you select the same target (natural armor or
      damage reduction), the penalty is increased by 2 instead of 1.</p>
