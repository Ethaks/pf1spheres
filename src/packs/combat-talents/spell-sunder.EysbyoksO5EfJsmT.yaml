      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere, base attack bonus
      +6.</p>

      <p>You may attempt to sunder an ongoing spell effect by succeeding at a
      special sunder combat maneuver attempt. For any effect that is not already
      on a creature, you must make a sunder combat maneuver attempt against a
      CMD of 15 plus the effect&#8217;s caster level. To sunder an effect on a
      creature, you must succeed at a normal sunder combat maneuver against the
      creature&#8217;s CMD +5, ignoring any miss chance caused by a spell or
      spell-like ability. If successful, you suppress the effect for 1 round, or
      2 rounds if you exceeded the CMD by 5 to 9. If you exceed the CMD by 10 or
      more, the effect is dispelled.</p>
