      <p>You do not need to make a Fly check to remain flying when moving less
      than half your speed on your turn and count as being one size larger when
      determining the effects of wind on you while flying. This does not give
      you the ability to fly; it simply augments your movement abilities if you
      possess a means of flight. You may gain ranks in the Fly skill even if you
      do not possess a means of flight. <strong>Associated Movement
      Mode:</strong> Flying. <strong>Associated Skill:</strong> Fly.</p>
