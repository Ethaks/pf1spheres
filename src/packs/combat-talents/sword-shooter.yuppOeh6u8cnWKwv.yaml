      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Equipment sphere, base attack bonus
      +6.</p>

      <p>You may treat lances, longswords, and spears as ammunition for
      longbows, shortbows, light crossbows, and heavy crossbows, being able to
      draw and load them as though they were ammunition (although they are not
      destroyed after hitting a target). Using these weapons as ammunition deals
      additional damage equal to the weapon&#8217;s damage die (this additional
      damage is not multiplied on a critical hit) and you take a -2 penalty on
      attack rolls made while using these weapons as ammunition. If you possess
      the Barroom sphere, you may use this talent with improvised weapons (you
      may not use an improvised weapon which would require more than one hand
      for you to wield). The penalty is doubled when making a full attack action
      while using these weapons as ammunition.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Ceaseless Ammo talent, you may use it with the
      listed weapons, although the same limitations apply, and if you possess
      the Ranged Impale talent, you may use it with this talent.</p>
