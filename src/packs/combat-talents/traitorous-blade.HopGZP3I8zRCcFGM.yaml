      <p>Whenever you succeed at a disarm attempt against a creature, as long as
      you have at least one free hand you may immediately catch the disarmed
      weapon and make a single attack with it against any creature within reach
      as an immediate action. If your base attack bonus is +10 or higher, you
      may instead make the granted attack as a free action that can be taken
      once per round, even if it&#8217;s not your turn.</p>
