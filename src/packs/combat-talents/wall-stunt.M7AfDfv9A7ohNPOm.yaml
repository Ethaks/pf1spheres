      <p>If you possess the (leap) package, when jumping or falling, you may
      make an Acrobatics check to jump as a swift action, provided there is a
      solid surface other than a ceiling (wall, floor, etc.) adjacent to you at
      that point. You may treat spaces occupied by creatures of your size or
      larger as containing such an object but your movement provokes attacks of
      opportunity as normal. Any fall damage that would be incurred is
      calculated after removing the height of the swift action jump.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (run) package, as long as there is a wall adjacent
      to you, you may run along the wall for all or part of your movement,
      including vertically. A square of vertical movement costs two squares of
      movement. You may treat spaces occupied by creatures of your size or
      larger as containing a wall, but your movement provokes attacks of
      opportunity as normal. Doing so bypasses any obstacle on the ground. You
      must end your movement on the ground as normal; if there is no ground
      present, you fall.</p>

      <p>If you also possess the (climb) package, you may attempt to cling to
      the wall at the end of your movement. If you possess the (leap) package,
      you may make Acrobatics checks to jump as part of this movement as normal.
      If you possess the Mobile Striker talent, you can kick off of a wall for
      the rest of your movement, gaining a +1 circumstance bonus to your damage
      roll if you make an attack while airborne. For every 5 ranks in Acrobatics
      you possess, this bonus increases by +1.</p>
