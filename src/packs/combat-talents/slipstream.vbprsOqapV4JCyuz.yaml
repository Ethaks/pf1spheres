      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Acrobatics, Fly or Swim 5 ranks,
      Athletics sphere.</p>

      <p>When you have martial focus, while using movement modes associated with
      the packages you possess, the squares that you pass through become easier
      to move through for 1 round, plus 1 round per 5 ranks you possess in the
      skill associated with the movement type. Allies who move through these
      squares only subtract 5 feet of movement for every 2 squares travelled
      within the affected squares. A creature that only moves through one of
      these affected squares in a round subtracts 5 feet of movement as
      normal.</p>
