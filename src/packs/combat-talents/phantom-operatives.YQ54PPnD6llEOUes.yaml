      Walk Unseen, Vanish), Warleader sphere (Covert Operations (tactic)).</p>

      <p>Allies benefiting from your Covert Operations tactic can attempt
      Stealth checks to hide even when observed. When an ally breaks stealth
      (such as by attacking or not stealthing at the end of their turn), they
      gain concealment until the start of their next turn.</p>
