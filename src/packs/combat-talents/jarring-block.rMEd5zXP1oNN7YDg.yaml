    value: >
      <p>Whenever a melee attack misses a creature benefiting from your active
      defense, you may initiate a disarm combat maneuver against the attacking
      creature as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity
      and that can be taken even when it is not your turn. This must target the
      weapon used for the triggering attack, and must be accomplished with your
      shield, rather than a weapon you are wielding. You may add your
      shield&#8217;s enhancement bonus to AC to your disarm check.</p>
