      "value": "<p>Choose up to two settlements with which you are familiar when you gain this talent; you have a group of followers permanently based in that settlement that cannot be dispersed unless the settlement is destroyed, in which case they regroup in a nearby settlement of your choice, regaining 10% of their strength per week. This group is in addition to your normal group of followers; you do not gain any additional benefit from having multiple groups of followers in the same location. This permanent group cannot form a caravan, so remains in the chosen settlement.</p>\n<p>Moving them to a new settlement requires 1d4 months of selling, buying, traveling, and forming new contacts. Severing ties with existing followers and recruiting new followers in a different settlement requires the same amount of time. You do not benefit from these followers during this time. At 5 ranks in Diplomacy and every 5 ranks thereafter, you may have your followers settled in an additional settlement simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Contacts from the (cohort) package will often choose to settle in a settlement where you maintain a presence via this talent. When you release a cohort and maintain them as a contact, unless they are particularly prone to wander or tied to a specific location, they will live in or near one of these locations of your choice.</p>\n",
