      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Guardian sphere, base attack bonus
      +5.</p>

      <p>When you deal damage to a creature while you have damage in your
      delayed damage pool, you may spend an immediate action to expend your
      martial focus and deal damage equal to the damage in your delayed damage
      pool to the target creature. If you possess the Cold Iron Call or Durable
      talents, you may also inflict any effects you are postponing with those
      abilities. If the effect allowed a save, the target may make a save
      immediately at the original DC.</p>

      <p>A successful Fortitude save reduces the amount of damage inflicted by
      this talent by half and negates the infliction of any effects.</p>

      <p><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Adjusted for clarity.</p>
