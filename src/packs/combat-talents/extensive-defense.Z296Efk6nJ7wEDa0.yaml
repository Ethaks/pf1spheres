      <p>You may expend martial focus as a free action that can be taken even
      when it&#8217;s not your turn to apply your active defense against all
      valid triggering attacks until the start of your next turn without
      spending attacks of opportunity. If you possess the Cover Ally talent, you
      may apply this benefit to all allies within reach.</p>
