      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere, Shatter Earth.</p>

      <p>You may choose to break the ground as you move. Whenever you leave a
      square, you may choose to make that square difficult terrain. Your base
      attack bonus must be greater than the hardness of the surface to use this
      ability. This difficult terrain remains until it is cleared as a standard
      action (clearing 1 square within the creature&#8217;s reach, provoking an
      attack of opportunity) or repaired with a spell or effect such as the
      mending spell or the repair ability of the Creation sphere.</p>
