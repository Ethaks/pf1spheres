      <p>Whenever you could throw an inhaled poison, instead of throwing the
      poison as a splash weapon you can have it affect either a cone-shaped
      spread with a length of twice the radius of the poison, or a line-shaped
      spread with a length four times the radius of the poison. As normal for
      cones and lines this spread starts from any corner of your square.</p>
