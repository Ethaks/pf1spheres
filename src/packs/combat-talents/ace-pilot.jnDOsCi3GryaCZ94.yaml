      <p>You gain 5 ranks in the Profession (pilot) skill, plus 5 ranks per
      additional talent spent in the Athletics sphere (maximum ranks equal to
      your total Hit Dice). If you already have ranks in the Profession (pilot)
      skill you may immediately retrain them, but you do not get to retrain when
      only temporarily gaining talents, such as through the armiger&#8217;s
      customized weapons class feature. When piloting a vehicle, you may benefit
      from Athletics sphere abilities you possess, substituting your Profession
      (pilot) skill for any skill checks called for by those abilities. The
      piloted vehicle must still possess movements modes appropriate to the
      packages you possess.</p>
