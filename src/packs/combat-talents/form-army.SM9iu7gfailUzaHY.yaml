      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (follower) package,
      Diplomacy 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>Once per kingdom turn, you may form an army. This army has an ACR equal
      to your ranks in Diplomacy - 2 and has a racial composition similar to
      your followers. Forming this army costs 0 build points and it has a
      consumption of 0. This army gains a +4 bonus on morale checks when your
      are acting as its commander. This talent may only grant you a single army
      at a time; using it again causes any previously raised armies to disperse.
      The army comes equipped with basic melee weapons; other resources may be
      purchased normally.</p>
