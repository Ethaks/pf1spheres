      <p>You can spur your allies into action to react faster to imminent
      threats. For the duration of this shout, you and your allies are immune to
      sleep and fascinated. In addition, when first affected by this shout, any
      sleeping allies immediately wake up, fascinated allies automatically break
      free of the fascinate effect, flat-footed allies no longer count as
      flat-footed even if they have not acted yet, and allies lying prone may
      stand up as an immediate action, provoking attacks of opportunity as
      normal.</p>
