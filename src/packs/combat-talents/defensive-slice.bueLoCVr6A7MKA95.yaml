    value: >
      <p>When a ranged attack is made against you or a creature within your
      reach (except for unusually massive ranged weapons and ranged attacks
      generated by spell effects), you may cut the weapon (or ammunition) out of
      the air, deflecting the attack so the target takes no damage. As an attack
      of opportunity, make a melee attack roll at your highest bonus. If the
      result is greater than the attack roll total of the ranged attack, the
      attack is deflected. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.
      <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Cut from the Air.</p>

      <p><strong>Addendum [Apoc]:</strong> You may take Defensive Slice a second
      time. If you do, whenever you use Defensive Slice, you may instead expend
      two attacks of opportunity when making the attack roll. If you succeed,
      you send the projectile back to the creature that made the attack, using
      your defensive slice&#8217;s attack roll. You may only use this ability
      once per round. <sup><strong>Source:</strong> <a
