    value: >
      <p>Creatures may benefit from your tactics even if they cannot see you, as
      long as they can hear your instructions; this allows creatures who are
      blind, but not deaf, to benefit from your tactics. You must still be able
      to see affected creatures and the area within your tactic&#8217;s radius
      to issue commands, but need not have direct line of sight or line of
      effect; for example, if you are watching an area through a magical viewing
      device and have a method of communicating verbally with affected allies in
      the area each round, you can maintain a tactic and grant its benefits to
      your allies without being physically present.</p>
