    value: >
      <p>As a move action while you are grappling an adjacent creature, you may
      regain your martial focus and treat that creature as granting you partial
      cover until the start of your next turn. If an attack misses your AC by 2
      or less, compare the result to the grappled creature&#8217;s AC; if the
      attack roll would hit the grappled creature&#8217;s AC, resolve the attack
      as though the grappled creature was the original target. You cannot use
      this ability if you do not control the grapple.</p>
