      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere.</p>

      <p>When you create a poison you may create a disease instead. The disease
      functions like the poison (and benefits from Alchemy sphere talents like a
      poison) with the following changes:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>It gains an onset period of 1 hour, but its duration is increased to 1
      week (this duration is still doubled by the Potent Poison talent). If you
      possess the Delayed Poison talent the onset period can be increased by a
      number of days equal to 1/2 your ranks in Craft (alchemy). The increase in
      duration applies only to any penalties of the poisons not the
      benefits.</li>

      <li>Instead of attempting a save to resist the poison every round, the
      save is made every 24 hours. If you possess the Lingering Poison talent
      and expend martial focus as part of creating a contact, ingested or injury
      disease, a creature that attempts a save against it must attempt a new
      save against the disease every 24 hours for a number of days equal to your
      practitioner modifier.</li>

      <li>If you possess the Food Poisoning talent and create an ingested
      disease, for every 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess, your ingested
      poisons last for another week (also doubled by the Potent Poison talent).
      A successful save does not end the disease&#8217;s effect, but a failed
      save causes a new effect as normal for that poison which lasts for the
      remaining duration of this disease.</li>

      <li>If you possess the Catalyzed Poison talent, you expend an existing
      disease in your possession in place of a poison.</li>

      <li>Your diseases can affect that which you selected with Specialized
      Venom.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You cannot be infected by diseases you created.</p>

      <p>If you possess at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy), you may select
      this talent a second time and make your diseases contagious. Creatures
      that remain within 30 feet of the infected for more than 30 minutes
      without protective clothing (any clothing item that grants any sort of
      bonuses against disease counts), become carriers and must attempt a saving
      throw as normal after the onset period. The disease will only spread to
      creatures of the same type (or subtype if the creature is humanoid or is
      an outsider), but for every 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess, you
      may select another creature type (or subtype) from the ranger's list of
      favored enemies to also be susceptible to infection.</p>
