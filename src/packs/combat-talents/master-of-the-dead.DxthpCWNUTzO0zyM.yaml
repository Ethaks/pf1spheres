      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (cohort)
      package.</p>

      <p>You may recruit cohorts with the undead type, finding and reanimating
      dead bodies with arcane rituals. Such cohorts are built normally,
      including racial selection, but have the undead type, and gain +1 natural
      armor and either DR 5/bludgeoning or DR 5/slashing. Such cohorts are
      mindless, gaining no skill points, and must have the warrior or woodsman
      profession. Mindless cohorts still gain skill ranks from spheres that
      grant them and may use these skills normally. They do not gain feats, but
      may take a combat talent any time they would have gained a feat. As
      undead, the cohort have no Constitution score (Con (-)) and determine
      their hit points using their Charisma score. Any creature or a race
      normally suitable to be a cohort may be recruited when using this ability
      and you may choose the number of Hit Dice the reanimated creature has.
      Mindless cohorts of the undead type will obey harmful and even suicidal
      orders. You take no penalties to your recruit checks for the destruction
      of undead cohorts. No Diplomacy check is required to recruit creatures in
      this way.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a second time; doing so allows you to create
      undead cohorts with their normal Intelligence scores, gaining feats and
      skills normally. These cohorts may be of any profession.</p>
