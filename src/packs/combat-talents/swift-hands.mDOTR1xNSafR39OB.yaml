      <p>You may use your Dexterity in place of your Strength when attempting a
      dirty trick or steal maneuver and may use your ranks in the Sleight of
      Hand skill in place of your base attack bonus when determining your combat
      maneuver bonus to perform a dirty trick or steal maneuver. In addition,
      you may apply any enhancement bonuses to your unarmed strikes to your
      dirty trick and steal combat maneuvers.</p>

      <h2 id="toc1"><span><span style="color: #993300">Marked
      Target</span></span></h2>

      <p>You may make a melee touch attack against a creature as a swift action;
      if this attack is successful, the creature is battered and takes a -1
      penalty on Perception checks for 1 round. For every 4 ranks in Sleight of
      Hand you possess, this penalty is increased by 1.</p>

      <p><strong>Trick:</strong> Whenever you perform a steal or dirty trick
      combat maneuver, or make a Sleight of Hand check to take an object from a
      target unnoticed, you may apply one (trick) talent to it. (Trick) talents
      cannot be applied to maneuvers performed as a free action.</p>
