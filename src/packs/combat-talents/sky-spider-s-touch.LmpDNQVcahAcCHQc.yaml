      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Climb 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>You can climb at your full base speed with no penalty, and may always
      take 10 on Climb checks, even when rushed or threatened. In addition, all
      base DCs for climbing all surfaces are reduced by half. This division
      happens before applying modifier such as from bracing between two walls,
      climbing a slippery surface, or when catching oneself while falling. You
      can climb with only one hand free with no penalty, or no hands free at a
      -5 penalty.</p>

      <p>In addition to the uses of Climb described by that skill, you also gain
      several new ones; specifically, you may climb smooth vertical walls or
      inverted surfaces with a DC 30 Climb check (reduced to 15 with this
      talent), ceilings without handholds with a DC 40 Climb check (reduced to
      20 with this talent), and even climb on nothing but air with a DC 60 Climb
      check (reduced to 30 with this talent).</p>

      <p>Wind speed penalties to Fly checks also apply to Climb checks made to
      cling to air. If you fail a Climb check when climbing on air, you fall 10
      ft. plus 10 ft. per 5 points by which you failed the check.</p>
