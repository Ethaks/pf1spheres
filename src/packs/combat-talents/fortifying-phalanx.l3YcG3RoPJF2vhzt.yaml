      <p>Allies within range of this tactic are granted a +1 morale bonus on
      Fortitude saving throws, +1 for every 4 ranks in Diplomacy you possess, as
      long as they are within the natural reach of at least one other ally
      affected by this tactic. Once per round when an ally affected by this
      tactic fails a Fortitude saving throw, you may spend an immediate action
      to allow them to reroll the save.</p>
