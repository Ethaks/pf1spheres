      <p>Your followers include actors, musicians, and other performers, and
      they possess props, backdrops, and the other accoutrements required for a
      dazzling performance.</p>

      <p>Any Perform checks made while with the followers automatically gain a
      +2 circumstance bonus from being well equipped and +2 circumstance bonus
      from the performers&#8217; aid. The bonus from the performer&#8217;s aid
      increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess. You may
      choose to have the DC of Knowledge checks regarding you to have their DC
      increase or decrease by up to 5. Changing this decision results in the DC
      increasing or decreasing by 1 per week until the new DC is reached. This
      DC change increases to 10 at 7 ranks in Diplomacy and 15 at 14 ranks.</p>

      <p>While in a settlement, your followers can always gain access to a
      theater, stage, or hall if one is present. You caravan has a portable
      stage for performances on the road. Additionally, when in a settlement,
      your followers collectively make Perform checks using your Diplomacy
      modifier, earning you the check result in gold pieces each week. This
      stacks with earnings from other talents.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Influence capital in place of earning gold, with 15 gp equaling 1
      Influence. This stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>

      <p>If using the reputation and fame rules from Ultimate Campaign, any time
      your followers are in a settlement for at least 1 day, that settlement is
      considered to be in your Sphere of Influence. Additionally, your followers
      can suppress negative talk about you, reducing the total penalties to your
      reputation by your Diplomacy modifier. Any infamous deeds are still known,
      but they are viewed in the most sympathetic light. Additionally, you gain
      +1 prestige point every character level.</p>
