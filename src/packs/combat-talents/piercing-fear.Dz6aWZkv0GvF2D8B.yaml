      <p>You may expend martial focus as part of an Intimidate check to
      demoralize to overcome a creature&#8217;s defenses, treating immunity to
      fear and mind-affecting effects as a +5 DC increase to the check&#8217;s
      DC (the DC only increases by +5 once, regardless of if the creature has
      immunity to both fear and mind-affecting effects).</p>
