      <p>You gain the following ability:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Righting Reflex:</strong> Whenever you would fall prone (such
      as from the trip combat maneuver), you may expend your martial focus as an
      immediate action. If you do, you are not tripped and remain standing on
      your feet. This ability can cause a successful trip maneuver to be treated
      as an unsuccessful one for the purposes of other abilities or effects. If
      you are flying and use this ability to not fall prone, you instead do not
      fall.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>In addition, if you possess the associated Athletics sphere package,
      you gain additional abilities:</p>

      <ul>

      <li><strong>Catwalk (requires (run) package):</strong> You may always take
      10 on Acrobatics checks made to cross narrow or uneven surfaces. In
      addition, as long as you have martial focus, you always succeed at
      Acrobatics checks made to not fall prone while moving faster than half
      your speed across a slippery surface (such as grease or ice) or while
      blind.</li>

      <li><strong>Soft-Paw Landing (requires (leap) package):</strong> During
      your turn, whenever you would fall at least 10 feet and suffer no falling
      damage (such as succeeding at Acrobatics check to soften a fall), you may
      immediately attempt a Stealth check to hide, and can hide even while you
      are observed or if you do not have cover or concealment. If this ability
      is used as part of your movement, you may complete your movement after
      attempting the Stealth check (such as to reposition into cover,
      etc.).</li>

      </ul>
