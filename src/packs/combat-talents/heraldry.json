      "value": "<p>As long as you hold your clan, house, nation or party&#8217;s flag, members of that allegiance who can see the flag (including yourself) treat the effects of your tactics as though you had 5 additional ranks in Diplomacy. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls while within the area of a tactic you create. A flag must held in either one hand or attached to a longspear, pole, or other similar object in order to grant this bonus. If the standard is taken by the enemy or destroyed, the bonuses granted by this talent become a penalty, you treat the effects of your tactics as though you had 5 less ranks in Diplomacy (to a minimum of 0), and you take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls within the area of tactics you create. This penalty lasts for 24 hours or until you repair your destroyed standard or acquire a new standard. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Flagbearer.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the banner class feature or other similar ability, you may treat your banner as your flag for the purposes of this talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Flag:</strong> A flag is a colorful banner that bears the heraldry or symbol of a nation or organization. A character with the Warleader (Heraldry) talent who bears a flag can grant additional combat bonuses to allies inside tactics they maintain. Carrying a flag in combat requires a free hand. <strong>Cost</strong> 10 gp <strong>Weight</strong> 3 lbs.</p>\n",
