      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 10</p>

      <p>You gain the knowledge of the creation of various minor types of
      beneficial alcohol. When you create this formulae, you create a set of
      drinks, with a number of drinks equal to your practitioner modifier,
      together counting as a single formulae slot.</p>

      <p>All drinks created with one formulae slot must be of the same type, and
      the slot is considered to be used until no creature benefits from them any
      longer, and all the drinks have expired or have been consumed or
      destroyed.</p>

      <p>You can create the following drinks:</p>

      <p><strong>Calming Cider:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol feel
      an incredible sense of calm, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus against
      emotion related effects for 1 hour. This bonus increases by 1 per 5 ranks
      in Craft (alchemy) that you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Invisible Ichor:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol
      cannot tell it is alcoholic, as it is entirely and purely tasteless, but
      is as potent as two alcoholic beverages. This drink also masks poisons
      mixed with it, foiling Perception checks entirely and even magic, unless
      the caster succeeds on a magic skill check against your Alchemy sphere
      DC.</p>

      <p><strong>Lullabying Lager:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol
      fall asleep after an hour of consuming it and experience a fully lucid and
      comforting dream, allowing them to regain twice the number of hit points
      or ability damage they regain from resting. This benefit stacks with the
      benefit provided by a Heal check made to provide long-term care, providing
      them with three times the benefits of resting.</p>

      <p><strong>Mindbending Mead:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol
      are subject to strange visual and sound-based hallucinations, which apply
      a -2 penalty to all Perception checks they attempt, but cause them to see
      past true illusions, granting them a +2 circumstance bonus against all
      illusion effects. The bonus and penalty both increase by 1 per 5 ranks in
      Craft (alchemy) that you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Painkilling Perry:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol
      are numbed to pain, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus against all
      pain-related effects for 1 hour. This bonus increases by 1 per 5 ranks in
      Craft (alchemy) that you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Revitalizing Rum:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol
      gain a +1 resistance bonus to the next saving throw they attempt within an
      hour. This bonus increases by 1 per 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy) that you
      possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Sobering Schnapps:</strong> You create the perfect concoction;
      an alcoholic drink that wears away at hangovers. Creatures that drink this
      alcohol ignore the penalties for being drunk (and bonuses, if any) for 1
      hour, and reduce the penalties from the sickened condition by half. Once
      you have 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy), the sickened condition is instead
      cured automatically, and creatures are immune to it for the duration.</p>

      <p><strong>Vitalizing Vodka:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol
      gain 1d4 temporary hit points for one hour. The amount of temporary hit
      points granted increases by 1d4 per 3 ranks in Craft (alchemy) that you
      possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Wakeful Whisky:</strong> Creatures that drink this alcohol can
      remain awake for eight hours without feeling sleepy, granting them a +2
      circumstance bonus against sleep effects. A creature can drink this drink
      to avoid needing to rest, but any vigorous activity such as fighting,
      traveling or similar ends the effect, and creatures must drink another or
      sleep for the remaining hours to avoid fatigue and to gain the benefits of
      a full night&#8217;s rest. The bonus increases by 1 per 5 ranks in Craft
      (alchemy) that you possess.</p>

      <p>A creature can only benefit from one drink at a time, although a single
      drink may have multiple alcohol types mixed together by raising the Craft
      DC. You can increase the Craft DC of this formulae when creating a set of
      drinks in increments of 10 to apply the effects of an additional alcohol
      type for each increment to the set of drinks, allowing a creature to
      benefit from multiple alcohol types at the same time from those
      drinks.</p>
