    value: >
      <p>You may ready an action to make an attack with a light melee weapon
      against the next enemy who makes a non-maneuver melee attack roll against
      you before the beginning of your next turn; this attack is treated as an
      attack action for the purposes of talents as well as the Vital Strike feat
      and occurs before the attack that triggers it, gaining a +2 competence
      bonus to damage rolls. For every 4 points of base attack bonus you
      possess, this bonus increases by +2. Using this ability does not change
      your place in the initiative order.</p>

      <p>You can apply a single talent with the (counter) tag to a counter
      punch.</p>

      <p>Whenever you ready a counter punch, you can decide on an additional
      trigger for your prepared attack from the following list; if the trigger
      is met, the readied attack qualifies as a counter punch (if an action
      would also provoke an attack of opportunity, you may choose in which order
      you wish to resolve your attacks):</p>

      <ul>

      <li>A hostile creature making an attack roll, other than as part of a
      combat maneuver</li>

      <li>A hostile creature attempting a combat maneuver</li>

      <li>A hostile creature moving from their square</li>

      <li>A hostile creature using a spell or a spell-like ability</li>

      <li>A hostile creature drawing a weapon</li>

      <li>A hostile creature speaking</li>

      </ul>

      <p>For every 5 points of base attack bonus you possess, you may select an
      additional trigger from this list.</p>
