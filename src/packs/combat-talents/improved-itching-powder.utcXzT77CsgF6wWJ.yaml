      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>

      <p>You create a single use bag of fine gray powder you can throw as a
      ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 ft. that causes targets
      to suffer from uncontrollable itching until they spend at least 1 round
      cleaning it off. Anyone standing on the square of impact or in adjacent
      squares must make a Fortitude save; targets 10 ft. away must also succeed
      at a Fortitude save but gain a +5 circumstance bonus. Creatures that fail
      the save take a &#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill
      checks, and ability checks until they wash the powder off. This is a
      poison effect. You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments
      of 10; each time you do so, the area of effect improves by 5 ft., and all
      saving throw DCs increase by +2.</p>
