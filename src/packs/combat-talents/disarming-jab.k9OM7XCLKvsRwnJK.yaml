      <p>Whenever you successfully attack with your counter punch, you can make
      a disarm attempt against the target as a free action which does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity. If you successfully disarm the target, you
      may automatically pick up the item dropped if you have an empty hand, even
      if you used a weapon to disarm the target.</p>

      <p>In addition, you gain the following new triggers to choose from when
      you ready a counter punch:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>A hostile creature uses a consumable item (e.g. a potion, Alchemy
      sphere formulae, etc.)</li>

      <li>A hostile creature activates a magic item (e.g. a wand, spell engine,
      etc.)</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> When you successfully disarm your opponent
      without using a weapon, you may automatically pick up the item
      dropped.</p>
