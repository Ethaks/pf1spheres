      <p>You may expend your martial focus to use up to two alchemical items
      that can normally be used as a standard action as part of the same
      standard action but you take a -2 penalty on your attack roll (if any) and
      creatures affected by the items gain a +2 circumstance bonus to their
      saving throws against their effects (if any); using this ability includes
      all actions necessary to use the items, including drawing them (but not
      creating them).</p>

      <p>Your target must be within range of both items. When you have at least
      10 ranks in Craft (alchemy), and again at 20 ranks, you may throw an
      additional alchemical item as part of the same action, taking an
      additional -2 penalty to your attack roll and increasing the circumstance
      bonus to affected creatures&#8217; saving throws by an additional +2 per
      item added.</p>
