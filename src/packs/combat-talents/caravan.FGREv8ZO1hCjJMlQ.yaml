      <p>Your followers can follow you as you travel, providing cartage. This
      caravan has an overland movement speed of 3 miles per hour and can travel
      32 miles a day. The caravan has wagons and draft animals necessary to
      carry 100 pounds of objects per rank in Diplomacy in addition to
      sufficient provisions to sustain themselves in normal conditions. A
      caravan is assumed to be capable of making Survival checks with a DC of 10
      + your ranks in Diplomacy to feed itself and 1 additional Medium creature
      per 5 followers (Medium creatures count as two Small creatures, Large
      creatures count as two Medium ones) while moving without affecting speed.
      In harsher environments, the caravan has supplies for 1 week plus 1 day
      per rank in Diplomacy that you possess. If their Survival check is not
      more than 5 below the environment DC, they count as only spending half a
      day&#8217;s supplies.</p>

      <p>The caravan can make camp, setting up tents, cooking, and performing
      other camp tasks. Doing so increases the progress a PC can make when
      crafting while adventuring by 2 hours per day (normally going from 2 hours
      to 4 hours a day).</p>

      <p>When you enter a settlement, you can disperse your caravan there,
      allowing you to gain the benefits of your followers while in that
      settlement. Gathering a caravan after it has been dispersed requires 1
      hour.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Your caravan doesn&#8217;t have to rest at the
      same time as you do. If the caravan rests while you adventure, they can
      travel while you rest, carrying a number of Medium creatures equal to your
      practitioner modifier plus your ranks in Diplomacy. Two Small creatures
      counts as one Medium creature, two Medium creatures count as one Large
      creature, etc.</p>

      <p>A caravan that is attacked in your absence will disperse. A dispersed
      caravan will reform, regaining 25% of its members every hour after threats
      are removed. If statistics are required for the caravan, treat it as a 1
      Hit Die troop per the Squad talent, but it takes no action except to
      attempt to flee to safety. The number of troops increases by +1 for every
      5 ranks in Diplomacy you possess, with your total number of followers
      divided equally between them. If such a troop is destroyed, treat half the
      followers in it as lost.</p>

      <h3 id="toc9"><span>Dividing Followers</span></h3>

      <p>You may divide your followers into multiple groups (minimum size of 5),
      treating your ranks in Diplomacy as equal to the number of available
      followers/4 (round down as usual). You may have multiple caravans, but any
      caravan not accompanied by a PC or cohort is at risk from the various
      hazards of travel and may not reach its destination, based on the
      conditions in the region it travels. The GM should roll random encounters,
      treating combat encounters as dispersing the caravan. Combat encounters
      with a CR of less than half your ranks in Diplomacy disperse the caravan
      but cause no permanent losses. Encounters with a CR of at least half your
      ranks in Diplomacy but not greater than your ranks disperses the caravan
      and causes 25% losses. A combat encounter with a CR of greater than your
      ranks in Diplomacy disperses the caravan and causes 50% losses. A caravan
      reduced below 4 followers is lost entirely.</p>

      <p>Talents marked (follower) grant additional options for your
      followers.</p>

      <h3 id="toc10"><span>Roleplaying Followers</span></h3>

      <p>While naming and developing personalities and tracking the abilities
      and developments of each individual in a large group of followers would be
      unnecessarily onerous, players and groups are encouraged to develop at
      least a few key followers to act as the focal points for interactions with
      followers. While on the move, a caravan will usually have a boss,
      directing others to execute the PC's directions. Likewise, talents that
      grant additional skills to your followers each lend themselves to having
      one higher ranking follower direct activities (scouting, trade, crafting)
      of the group of followers. As with cohorts, the GM will normally voice
      these NPCs, but in some groups allowing other players to speak and develop
      personalities for some of them could make the interactions more
      interesting.</p>

      <h3 id="toc11"><span>Followers And Statistics</span></h3>

      <p>Followers are normally intended to be governed by the abilities listed
      in the followers package and relevant talents. Using the statistics for
      commoners, experts, and troops are intended for use primarily when
      interactions cannot be easily handled narratively. Followers are not
      intended to be expendable operatives, skilled infiltrators, or massed
      alchemical bombers. If a PC's actions cause the unnecessary death of
      followers, follower recruitment may be slowed. Losses in the normal course
      of events should not have an effect; ambushes and unforeseen events occur,
      but repeated and extended abuse will discourage others from joining
      you.</p>
