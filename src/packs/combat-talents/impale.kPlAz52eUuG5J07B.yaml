      <p>When making a melee attack with the attack action that deals lethal
      damage, you can take a -2 penalty on the attack roll; if the attack is
      successful, your weapon impales the creature, forcing it into a square
      within your reach if it was not already. An impaled creature cannot move
      and is battered for as long as it remains impaled. An impaled creature who
      attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a
      concentration check (DC 10 + your CMB + spell level), or lose the spell.
      Weapons used to impale a creature cannot be used for attacks except for
      those against the impaled creature (you cannot impale more than a single
      creature with your unarmed strikes), ignoring armor, natural armor, and
      shield bonuses to AC. A creature can only be impaled by a single weapon;
      attempting to impale an already impaled creature automatically fails.
      Controlling an impaling weapon requires the same amount of hands as
      wielding the weapon does.</p>

      <p>This impalement may be broken when you lose control of the weapon used
      for the attack (such as by being disarmed), or by the impaled creature
      making a combat maneuver check as a standard action with a DC equal to
      your CMD. If you control the weapon being used to impale a creature, you
      may choose to automatically remove the weapon as a move action. When the
      impaled creature loses the impaled condition, they take bleed damage equal
      to the damage dice of the weapon used to impale the creature. If a
      creature is impaled by a weapon that is not controlled by another
      creature, they are able to move, but all movement speeds they possess are
      reduced by 1/2 (minimum 5 ft.).</p>

      <p>You must make an opposed Strength check against the impaled creature to
      move as a part of the move action (this Strength check is made by your
      mount if you are mounted), moving up to half of your base speed while the
      impaled creature is dragged along with you (this movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity).</p>

      <p>If you are impaling two or more creatures, you must make an opposed
      Strength check against all currently impaled creatures in order to move,
      and if you are subjected to forced movement, you must make an opposed
      Strength check against all impaled creature; failing this check against
      any impaled creature forces you to release any weapons you&#8217;re using
      to impale a creature (or to end impaling a creature with your unarmed
      strikes or natural attacks) immediately, while success drags any impaled
      creatures with you during this forced movement.</p>

      <p>You can also choose to release the weapon as a free action without
      dealing damage (although you cannot release natural weapons). A creature
      may attempt a grapple check against an impaled creature&#8217;s CMD to
      assume control of the weapon impaling that creature as long as another
      creature is not controlling it. If so, the creature making the attempt
      receives a +4 bonus on the grapple check.</p>

      <p>Talents with the (impale) tag can only be used against creatures who
      are impaled by this ability when you are controlling the impaling
      weapon.</p>
