      <p>When actively searching with the Perception skill (a move action), you
      may detect the presence of ongoing magical auras, such as those left by
      spells such as alarm or invisibility. If the target does not normally have
      a Perception DC, the DC is equal to the original spell DC as determined by
      the spell&#8217;s caster (DC 10 + spell level + caster&#8217;s casting
      ability modifier), or DC 25 if the effect does not originate from a source
      that would make it possible to determine a spell DC. This does not give
      you any information about the exact nature of magical effects detected in
      this manner, you are merely aware that a magical effect is active and the
      general area it is active in.</p>

      <p>So long as you have martial focus, you may make a Perception check to
      notice the presence of traps or ongoing magical effects (as described
      above) whenever you pass within 10 ft. of them, whether or not you are
      actively looking.</p>
