      <p>Whenever you successfully attack with your counter punch, you can make
      a bull rush attempt against the target as a free action which does not
      provoke attacks of opportunity. You can choose to move along with the
      target as a free action, although this movement provokes an attack of
      opportunity, and you must end this movement adjacent to the creature. At
      base attack bonus +10, the target falls prone at the end of this
      movement.</p>
