    value: >
      <p>You have mastered how to hold multiple pieces of ammunition in one hand
      for faster reloading and more accurate barrages. You may reduce your
      attack penalty by 1 when using the barrage ability. At +10 base attack
      bonus, you further reduce the penalty when using the barrage ability by 1.
      In addition, so long as you have martial focus, you do not provoke an
      attack of opportunity for reloading a ranged weapon.</p>
