      <p>You do not need kits to create combat sphere effects that do not
      possess a costly material component (such as an alchemy kit to create
      formulae from the Alchemy sphere). The materials are assumed to be
      gathered from your natural environment or generated by you.</p>

      <p>You may substitute your practitioner modifier for your Intelligence
      modifier when making Craft checks to create combat sphere effects.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a second time. If you do, you no longer
      require a free hand to use combat sphere effects based on your creations.
      This may mean spitting a formulae rather than throwing it (using the same
      range), licking a weapon to poison it, disgorging a trap as you lay it, or
      utilizing a gizmo that has been built into your body. This does not reduce
      the action needed to perform any of these actions. In addition, your
      creations are stored within your body rather than on your person,
      preventing them from being stolen or sundered. [Alienist HB]</p>
