      <p>You can create poisons as a move action even if you do not have access
      to an alchemist&#8217;s lab or alchemist&#8217;s crafting kit. If you have
      an alchemist&#8217;s lab or alchemist&#8217;s crafting kit, you can expend
      martial focus to create a poison as a swift action. You may still apply
      created poisons to a weapon as part of the same action used to create
      it.</p>
