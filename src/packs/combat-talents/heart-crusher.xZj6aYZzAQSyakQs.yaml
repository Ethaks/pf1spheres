    value: >
      <p>The creature damaged by your brutal strike suffers a -1 penalty on all
      Fortitude saves for as long as the creature is battered. This penalty
      increases by -1 for every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess. This
      penalty does not stack with other uses of the same talent. If the target
      was battered when struck, they additionally reduce all temporary hit
      points and healing they receive by 50% for as long as they are battered
      (Will negates). This does not affect healing gained from fast healing or
      regeneration.</p>
