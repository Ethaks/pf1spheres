      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Berserker sphere, base attack bonus +11.</p>\n<p>You unleash a powerful roar and swing a weapon with such extreme ferocity that you tear the very fabric of space and time, opening up a rift to another location. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you open up a rift to another location which may be as distant as 100 miles per point of base attack bonus you possess. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn&#8217;t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three points of base attack bonus you possess. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination; if you have not been to the desired destination before you do not arrive at the exact location, instead creating a rift to a location within 1d20 miles of the desired point.</p>\n<p>You are exhausted for 1 hour after using this ability, and are fatigued as normal thereafter. You incur these penalties even if you are immune to the exhausted and fatigued conditions, and the exhausted condition cannot be removed before its duration is up. You may attempt to use this ability while exhausted or fatigued, but doing so incurs a 50% chance that the ability fails to work; regardless of whether you succeed at this attempt, you suffer 1d6 points of Constitution damage and the duration of the exhausted condition caused by using this ability is doubled. This is a supernatural effect.</p>\n",
