      <p>When you have martial focus, while using movement modes associated with
      the packages you possess, you gain a competence bonus to your speed of +10
      ft. When using the (leap) package with this ability, apply the bonus to
      the maximum distance you may travel while jumping and to your base speed
      when determining the bonus to Acrobatics checks made to jump granted by
      your speed even if you are not trained in the (run) package. For every 5
      ranks you possess in the skill associated with a movement type, your speed
      with that movement type increases by an additional 5 ft.</p>
