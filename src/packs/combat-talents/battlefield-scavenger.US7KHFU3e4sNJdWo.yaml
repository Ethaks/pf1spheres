      <p>When collecting non-firearm ammunition after it has been used in
      combat, you have a 85% chance of retrieving the ammo in good condition
      such that it can be used again, rather than 50%. You may draw a thrown
      weapon or a piece of non-firearm ammunition from the environment or a dead
      creature as part of the same action used to make a ranged attack with
      it.</p>

      <p>You may attempt to extract thrown weapons or non-firearm ammunition
      from a living creature as well, but doing so requires you to make a steal
      combat maneuver. If successful, you may extract as many thrown weapons or
      pieces of non-firearm ammunition as you desire from the target creature,
      up to the total amount present. If the steal was performed as a standard
      action, you may use the ammunition to make an attack action as part of the
      same standard action used to perform the steal combat maneuver.</p>

      <p>When extracting weapons or ammunition from a target in this fashion,
      that target suffers 1 point of bleed damage per piece of ammunition
      extracted. This bleed damage stacks with itself.</p>
