    value: >
      <p>Whenever you control a grapple against a creature, that creature is
      unable to breathe or speak, though they may hold their breath in response
      to being grappled. Each consecutive round they spend grappled by you
      counts as a number of rounds equal to your practitioner modifier against
      the total number of rounds they may hold their breath before they are
      forced to make Constitution checks to avoid suffocating. For every 4
      points of base attack bonus you possess, each passing round counts as an
      additional +1 round when determining how long they can hold their
      breath.</p>
