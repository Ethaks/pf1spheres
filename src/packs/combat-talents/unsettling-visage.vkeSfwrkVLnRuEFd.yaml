    value: >
      <p>Your excessive brutality is unnerving, and makes your enemies uneasy
      around you. Until the end of your next turn, you may spend an attack of
      opportunity to attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent
      within range of this boast that targets you with an attack, including a
      targeted spell. You may expend your martial focus to attempt this
      Intimidate check in place of spending an attack of opportunity. You may
      not use this talent in conjunction with Frightful or any other ability
      that would allow you to use the Intimidate skill to demoralize beyond the
      shaken condition.</p>
