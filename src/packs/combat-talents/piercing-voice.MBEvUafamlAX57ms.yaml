      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere.</p>

      <p>Whenever you would be affected by a magic effect that would make you
      unable to speak (such as the silence option of the Suppression Illusion
      talent), the caster must first attempt a magic skill check against a DC
      equal to 10 + 1/2 your Diplomacy ranks + your practitioner modifier
      (minimum 1). If the caster fails, your voice is not affected by the magic
      effect, allowing you to speak, use shouts, tactics with verbal components,
      etc. If the caster succeeds, your voice is completely silenced and
      affected by the effect normally. If the effect would suppress other forms
      of noise (such as moving), they still remain suppressed even if the caster
      fails.</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever the effects of your shouts would be either
      reduced in range or completely negated with a solid barrier or wall, they
      instead carry through the obstruction without interruption.</p>
