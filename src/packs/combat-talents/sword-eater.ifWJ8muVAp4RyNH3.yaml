      <p>While in this stance, when a creature targets you with a manufactured
      melee weapon attack, you may attempt to sunder the weapon used to make the
      attack as an attack of opportunity after it resolves. If the creature
      attacking you is battered, you may resolve your sunder attempt prior to
      their attack being resolved.</p>
