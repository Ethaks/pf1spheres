      <p>When you would attempt a Reflex save that would affect both you and an
      adjacent ally, you can expend your martial focus to take the result of
      your die roll or that of your ally. If you take your ally&#8217;s result,
      you are knocked prone (or staggered on your next turn, if you are already
      prone or cannot be knocked prone). <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Duck
      and Cover.</p>
