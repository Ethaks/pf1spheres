      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wrestling sphere, base attack bonus
      +10.</p>

      <p>When you successfully maintain a grapple against a creature you have
      already pinned, you may expend your martial focus as an immediate action
      to attempt to remove a limb from them; the creature must make a successful
      Fortitude save or have one of its limbs removed by you (arms, legs,
      tentacles, or wings), ending the grapple.</p>

      <p>If you remove a wing, the target loses a wing natural attack if it had
      any and cannot fly (creatures with 3 or more wings who lose a wing have
      their flight maneuverability reduced to clumsy and have their flight speed
      reduced by 1/2 for each wing which they are missing). If you remove a
      tentacle, the creature loses all attacks and abilities related to that
      tentacle. If you remove an arm or leg, the target suffers a series of
      penalties listed below.</p>

      <p>Creatures with more than 2 legs do not suffer the penalties listed
      below, but instead lose 10 ft. from their movement speed and lose the
      benefits of being a quadruped if they had them. In addition, the target
      suffers 1d6 points of bleed damage from the wound, +1d6 for every 4 points
      of base attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p>A severed limb counts as an object one size category smaller than the
      creature it came from if using it as an independent object or improvised
      weapon.</p>

      <p>A character who has lost an arm incurs the following penalties:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>-10 penalty on Climb, Craft, Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, and Use
      Magic Device skill checks;</li>

      <li>-8 penalty on grapple checks;</li>

      <li>Must make a caster level check at a -5 penalty to cast spells with
      somatic components;</li>

      <li>Unable to wield weapons two-handed or make two-weapon attacks, and may
      not wear a shield on the affected arm.</li>

      <li>Carrying capacity is not reduced. However, the maximum weight a
      character can lift over head or off the ground is halved.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>A character who has lost a leg incurs the following penalties:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>-10 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, Stealth, and certain Perform
      skill checks (GM&#8217;s discretion).</li>

      <li>Cannot run or charge.</li>

      <li>Cannot bull rush or overrun and takes a -12 penalty to resist these
      combat maneuvers.</li>

      <li>Speed is reduced to 5 ft., and can no longer make a 5-ft step.</li>

      <li>Carrying capacity is reduced by two thirds and the maximum weight a
      character can lift over head or off the ground is halved when sitting,
      impossible when standing.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>These penalties do not stack with other penalties for losing limbs. A
      character who has lost both arms cannot use any of the listed skills, make
      attacks, or use objects, without the aid of prosthetics or magic. A
      character who has lost both legs is always considered flat-footed and
      prone, and can only move 5 ft as a full round action, without the aid of
      prosthetics or magic.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Undead are not immune to this effect and must
      make the saving throw.</p>
