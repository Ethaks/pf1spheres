      <p>You gain the ability to react to danger before your senses would
      normally allow you to do so. You cannot be caught flat-footed, nor do you
      lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. You still
      lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You can still lose your
      Dexterity bonus to AC if a creature successfully uses the feint action
      against you. You may take this talent twice; the second time you take it,
      you can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a creature the ability
      to sneak attack you by flanking you, unless the attacker is at least four
      levels higher or has at least 4 more Hit Dice than you. If you have
      already gained uncanny dodge from another source, such as the rogue
      talent, the first instance of this talent instead gives you the benefits
      of improved uncanny dodge.</p>
