      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Lancer sphere, impale ability, base
      attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>Whenever you control a weapon that is impaling a creature, whenever you
      take damage, that creature must make a successful Fortitude save or suffer
      1/4 of the damage dealt to you; this damage is typeless and cannot be
      reduced. If the impaled creature would regain hit points from a
      non-extraordinary source, they must make a successful Will save or gain
      only 1/2 of the hit points they normally would, granting you temporary hit
      points equal to 1/2 of the healing they would receive. These hit points
      last for 1 minute.</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, the target instead suffers 1/2 the damage you
      would on a failed save, taking 1/4 of the damage on a successful save.
      This is a supernatural ability.</p>
