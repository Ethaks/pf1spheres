      <p>You may only enter this stance when wearing armor equipped with armor
      spikes. While in this stance when a creature within the reach of your
      armor spikes makes a melee attack against you, they provoke an attack of
      opportunity from you. This attack of opportunity is resolved after the
      triggering attack. The attack of opportunity granted by the talent must be
      made using armor spikes, and you may only make one attack of opportunity
      this way per creature per round. This may not be combined with the Bloody
      Counter Berserker talent.</p>
