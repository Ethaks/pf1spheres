      <p>As a swift action, you may identify a creature&#8217;s weaknesses (DC
      10 + creature&#8217;s CR) as described under the Knowledge skill, but may
      substitute a Perception check for the appropriate Knowledge check at a -5
      penalty. This only reveals the target&#8217;s weaknesses, or lack thereof,
      (such as damage reduction types and vulnerabilities), and does not reveal
      any additional information about the target. Once you have succeeded at a
      scout attempt or Knowledge check against a target, any talents or effects
      that require you to scout a target may be used against the target for the
      next 24 hours; after this period you must successfully use the scout
      ability against the target again to continue benefiting from related
      effects.</p>
