      <p>You may modify your formulae into an oil, called a coating that can be
      applied to weapons by increasing Craft (alchemy) DC to create them by 5.
      The coating&#8217;s effects are added to any attacks you make in which you
      successfully hit the target. Formulae applied as a coating only affect the
      target of the attack and lose any splash damage or area of effect they
      might normally possess. If the formulae does damage on a hit, the damage
      is reduced to 1d6 + 1/2 your ranks in Craft (alchemy) per successful
      attack. If a formulae normally deals multiple types of damage (such as
      fire and bludgeoning), it instead deals one type of damage (chosen at the
      time of the application).</p>

      <p>You may apply a coating to one weapon (including ranged weapons, which
      apply the effects to ammunition they fire), one end of a double weapon, or
      ten thrown weapons as a move action, or as a swift action if you expend
      your martial focus. Only one coating can be applied to any piece of
      equipment at a time. Any time that you could apply a poison to a weapon,
      you may instead apply a coating in its place.</p>

      <p>Once applied, coatings remain active for a number of rounds equal to
      your Practitioner modifier + 1 per 4 ranks in Craft (alchemy). Additional
      damage from a coating is never multiplied on a critical hit, but otherwise
      stacks with effects such as flaming, shock, or corrosive.</p>
