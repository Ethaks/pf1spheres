      <p>Once per round, when a creature makes a melee attack against you, you
      may spend an immediate action to force them to make a Fortitude save at
      the end of their turn or be fatigued for 1 round; in addition, the
      creature takes a -2 penalty to this saving throw for each attack they make
      that round. This fatigue last for 1 additional round for each 4 points of
      base attack bonus you possess. If your base attack bonus is +10 or higher,
      that creature is instead exhausted instead of fatigued.</p>
