    value: >
      <p>Whenever a creature within your threatened area misses you with a melee
      attack, you may expend an attack of opportunity as a free action that can
      be taken even when it is not your turn to force the creature to succeed at
      a Fortitude saving throw or become fatigued for 1 round.</p>

      <p>This fatigue lasts for 1 additional round for each 4 points of base
      attack bonus you possess. If your base attack bonus is +10 or higher, a
      fatigued creature that fails its save becomes exhausted instead of
      fatigued. You may not use this talent in conjunction with (deflect)
      talents or any other ability that would grant you an attack or combat
      maneuver due to a missed attack against you.</p>
