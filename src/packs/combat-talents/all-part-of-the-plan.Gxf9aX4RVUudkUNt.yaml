      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Craft (traps) 5 ranks, Trap sphere
      (Rapid Placement).</p>

      <p>Your ability to place traps is so speedy, some would say there is no
      logical point in time when you could have ever set the trap in the first
      place!</p>

      <p>Whenever a creature that is flat-footed or denied its Dexterity bonus
      to AC moves into an unoccupied square within close range (25 feet + 5 feet
      per 2 ranks of Craft (traps) you possess) you may expend martial focus as
      an immediate action to treat that space as if it was a dart or tripwire
      snare unmodified by any Trap sphere talents you had set up previously.
      This must have been a trap you could setup as a single full-round action,
      and you must still succeed on the skill check to place it there
      successfully. If the creature has the ability to notice the presence of
      traps without actively searching (such as with the Heightened Awareness
      talent or See Hazard sense), they get to make a free Perception check
      against the DC to spot the trap, and if they succeed, do not trigger the
      trap.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a second time when you possess 10 ranks in
      Craft (traps), to be able to apply alchemical, magical, and technological
      items, as well as other dart or snare types you know, as part of the trap
      (you must still possess the ability and resources to do so).</p>
