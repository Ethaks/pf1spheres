      <p>You do not take penalties for using weapons sized for smaller
      creatures. For example, a Medium creature could wield a two-handed weapon
      sized for smaller creatures in one hand without incurring the penalty for
      wielding inappropriately sized weapons.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to Sleight of Hand checks
      made to conceal a weapon on your person for each size smaller the weapon
      is sized for. For example, a Medium creature using a dagger sized for Tiny
      creatures would receive a +2 bonus to a Sleight of Hand check to conceal
      it on their person.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Using a weapon inappropriately sized for you
      incurs a -2 penalty on attack rolls for each size category difference. A
      weapon smaller than its wielder takes one step less effort to wield in
      combat for each step smaller they are than the wielder. A Small-sized
      two-handed weapon can be wielded by a Medium creature as a one-handed
      weapon. A Small-sized one-handed weapon can be wielded by a Medium
      creature as a light weapon. See the weapon rules for more details
      (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook pg. 140).</p>
