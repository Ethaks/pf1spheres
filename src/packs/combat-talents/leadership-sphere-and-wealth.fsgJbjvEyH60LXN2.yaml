      <p>Hiring NPCs to accompany you on adventures normally costs wealth.
      Likewise, having a group of commoners working for you would normally be
      expected to generate wealth. The Leadership sphere is intended neither to
      force players to pay gold to use abilities they paid character-building
      resources (talents) for, nor to significantly skew expected wealth. The
      costs and profits from cohorts and followers from the Leadership sphere
      are abstracted. Cohorts are paid in the experience they gain, in the
      miscellaneous items that they recover and sell that the PCs don't bother
      with, and from surplus income of followers (if the (followers) package is
      also possessed). Likewise, wealth generated by followers is assumed to go
      into providing the mechanical benefits they provide, into establishing
      businesses and homes, into bribes, and towards supporting their leader and
      his associates.</p>

      <p><strong>Note: General Profits:</strong> Some Leadership talents state
      that you can make earnings checks, and that these stack with capital gains
      from other talents. This means that you can make a check for each such
      talent when calculating earnings.</p>

      <p>Specialized NPCs called cohorts are willing to follow you on
      adventures. A cohort always acts on your initiative. You gain the
      following ability:</p>
