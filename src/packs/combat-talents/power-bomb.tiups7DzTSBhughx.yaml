      <p>You can lift a creature into the air before dropping them onto the
      ground, dealing 1d8 + your practitioner modifier damage and forcing them
      to make a successful Fortitude save or become fatigued for 1 round, ending
      the grapple. A creature that fails the save is also knocked prone. At +10
      base attack bonus, the creature is knocked prone regardless of if they
      make the Fortitude save.</p>
