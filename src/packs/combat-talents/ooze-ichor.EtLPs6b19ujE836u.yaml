    value: >
      <p>You are able to deal bleed damage to behemoths, constructs, elementals,
      and undead, bypassing their normal immunity, though all bleed damage you
      deal to such creatures is reduced to half of what it would normally be, to
      a minimum of 1 point of bleed damage whenever you would successfully deal
      bleed damage to such a creature.</p>

      <p><strong>Blood Sphere note:</strong> The Duelist sphere Ooze Ichor
      talent allows the user to deal bleed damage to creature types that are
      normally immune, but does not by itself make them susceptible to blood
      control.</p>
