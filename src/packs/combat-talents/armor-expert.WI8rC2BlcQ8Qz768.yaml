      <p>You increase the armor bonus to AC of any armor you are wearing by +1.
      When your base attack bonus reaches +8, you lower the armor check penalty
      of any armor you wear by 1. For every 8 points of base attack bonus you
      gain thereafter, you reduce the armor check penalty of your worn armor by
      a further 1 (this cannot reduce your armor check penalty below 0). The
      benefits granted by this talent do not stack with those provided by the
      Armor Focus and Improved Armor Focus feats. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Armor Focus.</p>
