    value: >
      <p>Whenever you use an attack action to deal bleed damage to a creature,
      one creature that is grappled, pinned, impaled, or swallowed whole by the
      target may make an immediate check to escape (such as a combat maneuver or
      Escape Artist check) with a bonus equal to the amount of bleed damage the
      target is taking (this may include yourself if you are restrained in such
      a way). A creature that is no longer impaled takes bleed damage as normal.
      Other conditions may be negated by this talent at GM discretion.</p>
