    value: >
      <p>When a creature makes a melee or ranged attack against you, you may
      spend an attack of opportunity to break a weapon you are wielding. Make an
      attack roll as if you were making an attack of opportunity. If the result
      is greater than the attack roll total of the attack roll, you may roll
      your weapon&#8217;s damage die + your practitioner modifier (minimum 1)
      and reduce the damage taken by that result. If this would reduce the
      damage taken to 0, the attack counts as a miss for the purposes of
      abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss.</p>

      <p>If you have the ability to draw weapons as a free action (such as the
      Quick Draw feat or Equipment sphere Fast Draw talent), you may draw a
      weapon (or improvised weapon) as part of using this ability.</p>
