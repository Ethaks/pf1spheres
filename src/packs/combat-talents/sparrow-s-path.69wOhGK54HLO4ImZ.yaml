      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Fly 3 ranks.</p>

      <p>You gain a fly speed equal to half your base speed, with a
      maneuverability of clumsy. The fly speed only functions during your turn;
      if you are not on a surface that can support you at the end of your turn,
      you fall. If you deal damage to a hostile creature with a melee attack
      during your turn, you may choose not to fall at the end of that turn.</p>

      <p>At 8 ranks in Fly, this fly speed becomes permanent. This is a
      supernatural effect.</p>
