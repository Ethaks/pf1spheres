      <p>You cause the target to stumble, letting you slip past them. You may
      immediately move up to half your movement speed as a free action, so long
      as you end your movement in a space adjacent to the target, and may even
      move through the target&#8217;s occupied space when doing so. This
      movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the target.</p>
