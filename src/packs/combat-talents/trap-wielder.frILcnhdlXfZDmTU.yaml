      <p>Sometimes the heat of battle does not allow one to properly set and
      camouflage a trap. Instead of placing a trap, you may attempt to
      immediately apply it to a creature. Doing so requires the normal action
      for placing the trap. As the trap is never set, creatures do not gain any
      bonus to AC or saves for seeing you set the trap. You may poison a trap
      used in this way by spending the required action to poison a weapon no
      more than 1 round prior to using this talent.</p>

      <p>A dart trap may be immediately triggered, originating its line from any
      corner of your square. This provokes attacks of opportunity as a ranged
      attack.</p>

      <p>A snare trap may be employed against any creature within your natural
      reach and does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
