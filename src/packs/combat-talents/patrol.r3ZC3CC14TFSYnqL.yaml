    value: >
      <p>As long as you have martial focus, as a full-round action you may
      increase your threatened area by 5 ft., +5 ft. for every 4 points of base
      attack bonus you possess. This increased threatened area is applied after
      the effects of the reach weapon special feature. Until the beginning of
      your next turn, you may make attacks of opportunity against any creature
      in this threatened area that provokes attacks of opportunity. You may move
      to bring the creature that provokes the attack of opportunity within your
      reach as part of these attacks, provided your total movement before your
      next turn does not exceed your base speed. Any movement you make provokes
      attacks of opportunity as normal. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Combat
      Patrol.</p>

      <p>Talents with the (zone) tag grant additional effects to this ability.
      Each patrol may only benefit from one (zone) talent.</p>
