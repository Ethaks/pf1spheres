      <p>Any creature you are mounted on is considered proficient with all
      armors you are proficient with. If you fail the Ride check granted by the
      Defensive Rider talent by 5 or less while your mount is wearing barding
      that it is proficient with, the attack damages your mount&#8217;s barding
      instead of your mount. Any damage in excess of the barding&#8217;s hit
      points is dealt to the mount.</p>

      <p>In addition, your mount may fly in medium or heavy barding.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> A mount wearing medium or heavy barding cannot
      fly.</p>
