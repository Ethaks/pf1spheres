      <p>Whenever you make an attack using the attack action against a creature
      using the weapon currently impaling them, you may remove the impaling
      weapon as a swift action, dealing damage as appropriate and causing them
      to retain all penalties for being impaled (except for being unable to
      move) until the end of their next turn.</p>
