      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 15</p>

      <p>You create a single-use jar filled with a durable chemical foam that
      expands to fill an area when shattered. This item can be thrown as a
      ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet into an unoccupied
      square capable of supporting an object as a standard action.</p>

      <p>The foam fills an area with a radius of 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 ranks in
      Craft (alchemy) with semi-solid foam. A 5-foot block of foam possesses a
      break DC equal to your Alchemy sphere DC and has a number of hit points
      equal to your ranks in Craft (alchemy). A creature may attempt to move
      through the foam during their turn, requiring a successful break attempt
      for every 5 feet they pass through. On a failed break attempt they can no
      longer move through the foam and their movement ends. Creatures in the
      radius are allowed a Reflex save to be pushed to a square at the edge of
      the radius to avoid entrapment. Creatures that fail their Reflex save may
      attack the foam or try other means of escape as described above.</p>

      <p>The foam also serves a cushioning function preventing 15 feet of fall
      damage for every 5 feet of foam exists between the ground and the point
      where the falling individual touches the foam.</p>

      <p>This foam is porous to oxygen, and cannot be used to suffocate a
      creature, and too light to deal damage as a falling object. The foam
      dissipates on its own after 1 minute.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC of this item in increments of 10; each
      time you do so, each 5-foot square of foam gains 5 additional hit points,
      and lasts for an additional minute.</p>
