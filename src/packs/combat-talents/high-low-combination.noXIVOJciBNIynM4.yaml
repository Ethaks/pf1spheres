      <p>Whenever you use dual attack and successfully strike a creature with
      your main-hand weapon, you may forgo your off-hand weapon attack to make a
      trip attempt against the target of your main-hand attack without provoking
      an attack of opportunity (if you use a ranged weapon to make this trip
      attempt, the creature must be within 30 ft.).</p>
