      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Acrobatics 3 ranks, Athletics sphere
      ((leap) package), Boxing sphere (Gazelle Punch).</p>

      <p>While in this stance, as part of readying a counterpunch, you may
      attempt an Acrobatics check to jump (DC 10 + distance traveled), moving in
      a straight line up to that distance (half distance for vertical movement).
      A jump made this way cannot exceed your land speed.</p>

      <p>In addition, while in this stance, the effective reach granted by the
      Gazelle Punch talent increases an additional +5 feet + 5 feet per 5 base
      attack bonus you possess (up to your speed).</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> While in this stance, you ready a
      counterpunch and roll an Acrobatics check to jump. With a result of 31,
      you jump up to 20 feet; this jump does not count against your normal
      movement, and you could have moved normally before readying the
      counterpunch and making this jump.</p>
