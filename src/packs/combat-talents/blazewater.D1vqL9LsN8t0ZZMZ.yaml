      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Barroom sphere, base attack bonus
      +7.</p>

      <p>Whenever you would be able to imbibe an alcoholic beverage, you may
      instead pour it onto a weapon you or an adjacent ally is wielding and set
      it ablaze. For one minute, that weapon gains the flaming burst magic
      weapon special ability, except the effect is considered extraordinary
      rather than magical.</p>
