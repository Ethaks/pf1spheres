      <p>As long as you have the drunk status, you may deal lethal damage with
      your unarmed strikes and you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for
      using them. If you would normally be able to do this, you are treated as
      one size larger for the amount of damage your unarmed strikes deal. You
      can expend your drunk status to deal maximum damage with an unarmed strike
      as a free action.</p>
