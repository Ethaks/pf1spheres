      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Equipment sphere (Oversized Weapons),
      base attack bonus +6.</p>

      <p>You may wield shields that are one size category larger than you. While
      wielding a shield that is larger than you, you gain a +1 bonus to your
      CMD. While wielding a tower shield that is larger than you, when you use
      your tower shield to provide cover, you treat your space as though you
      were the same size category as your shield. This allows you to provide
      cover for other creatures.</p>
