      <p>After causing a creature to begin bleeding, you may spend a move action
      to regain your martial focus. As part of this move action, you may make a
      melee touch attack as a free action against a non-bleeding creature within
      reach. This attack deals no damage, but causes that creature to begin
      bleeding as per your blooded strike. (This does not allow you to apply a
      (bleed) talent.) Additionally, when an enemy causes you to begin bleeding,
      you may spend an immediate action to regain your martial focus.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> For the intents of this talent, "begin
      bleeding" refers to any application of a new source of bleed damage that
      the creature did not already suffer from, rather than causing a creature
      to begin bleeding for the first time.</p>
