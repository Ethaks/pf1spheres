      <p>While in this stance, whenever a creature makes an attack against you
      and misses while you are moving using a movement mode corresponding to a
      package you possess, you may perform an attack of opportunity against
      them. You may not use this talent in conjunction with (deflect) talents or
      any other ability that would grant you an attack or combat maneuver due to
      a missed attack against you.</p>
