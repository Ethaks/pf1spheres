      <p>A creature that fails its save against a tripwire snare falls prone.
      Once knocked prone, a creature is no longer at risk of triggering the trap
      in that square. This trap is not destroyed when triggered; instead the
      duration is reduced by 5 rounds per creature that fails its save. Running
      and charging creatures take a -2 penalty on their Reflex saves against
      this trap.</p>
