      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 15</p>

      <p>You create a poultice that can be used as a standard action to heal
      yourself or a target within your natural reach for 1d8 points of damage
      per 2 ranks in Craft (alchemy) you possess (minimum 1d8) plus your
      practitioner modifier. You can only attempt to heal a particular creature
      with this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 the number of
      ranks you possess in the Craft (alchemy) skill (minimum 1) plus your
      practitioner modifier.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; each
      time you do so you increase the healing granted by the salve by 5.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Note:</strong> Salves can stop bleeding. Salves can't heal
      creatures that only regain hit points by repairs or spells such as
      <em>make whole</em> (mainly constructs/objects), but generally can heal
      undead and similar types of targets.</sup></p>
