      <p>When you have martial focus, your unarmed strikes are treated as though
      they were magic for the purpose of damage reduction and damaging
      incorporeal creatures. For every 5 points of base attack bonus you
      possess, you can select a material or component of your alignment,
      treating your unarmed strikes as the chosen material or alignment for the
      purpose of damage reduction. Once chosen, these choices cannot be
      changed.</p>
