      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dual Wielding sphere, base attack bonus
      +6.</p>

      <p>You gain the ability to wield a sword in your teeth, treating your
      mouth as an additional hand that can only be used to wield a one-handed or
      light weapon. While wielding a weapon in this manner, you suffer a 50%
      spell failure chance to cast any spell with a verbal component, or
      increase any existing spell failure chance for spells with verbal
      components by 50%. In addition, whenever you make a dual attack, you may
      make an additional off-hand attack with the weapon wielded in your mouth
      as an immediate action.</p>
