    value: >
      <p>As a full-round action, you can stomp the ground so furiously that
      nearby creatures fall prone. You may expend your martial focus to perform
      an earthquake stomp as a standard action.</p>

      <p>Make a single trip attempt as a free action that does not provoke an
      attack of opportunity and compare it to all valid targets within 5 ft. of
      you. You may use your bull rush CMB when making this check (as the trip is
      being made by slamming the ground). Enemies not knocked prone cannot
      attempt to trip you in return.</p>

      <p>The affected area increases its radius by an additional 5 ft. per 10
      base attack bonus.</p>
