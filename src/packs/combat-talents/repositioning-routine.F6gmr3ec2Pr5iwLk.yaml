    value: >
      <p>Whenever you use an attack action and successfully strike a single
      creature with both your main-hand and off-hand weapons before the start of
      your next turn, you can attempt a reposition combat maneuver against the
      target of the attacks as a free action which does not provoke attacks of
      opportunity (if the creature is not within your natural reach, you may
      attempt this reposition combat maneuver with a -2 penalty as long as that
      creature is within the first range increment of a ranged weapon you wield,
      although doing so requires you to expend a piece of ammunition or throw a
      weapon to do so).</p>
