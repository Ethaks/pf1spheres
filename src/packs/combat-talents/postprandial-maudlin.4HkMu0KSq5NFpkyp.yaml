      <p>You may eat a meal instead of imbibing an alcoholic drink to gain the
      drunk status, but you gain the status for double the duration (twice
      Constitution modifier rounds + 1 per 2 points of base attack bonus). When
      using hard drinker, you may as a move action, retrieve and eat a poor
      quality meal (or a meal created by an iron chef) instead of an alcoholic
      drink. If you possess the Iron Liver talent, you also double the number of
      meals you can consume before gaining the sickened condition.</p>

      <p><strong>Food</strong><br>

      Just as a character can only consume a number of alcoholic beverages
      before being sickened, so too can one by eating too many meals. In
      general, a character can consume a number of poor quality meals equal to 1
      plus double his Constitution modifier before being sickened for 1 hour per
      the number of meals above this maximum. Each common meal is the equivalent
      of 2 poor quality meals, good quality meals are the equivalent of 4 poor
      quality meals, and banquet quality meals are the equivalent of 8 poor
      quality meals.</p>

      The table below are suggestions for how long it takes to consume meals of
      various qualities:<br>
