      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Athletics sphere.</p>

      <p>Whenever you move at least 30 feet, you may whip up a gust of wind.
      This wind affects every square adjacent to you during this movement and
      triggers at the end of your movement. Creatures in affected squares that
      are at least 2 sizes smaller than you must succeed at a Reflex save or
      have their movement speed reduced by half for one round. Creatures in
      affected squares that are at least 3 sizes smaller than you automatically
      have their movement speed reduced by half for one round and must succeed
      at a Reflex save or be pushed 5 feet and knocked prone. Creatures are
      pushed in a direction relative to your movement when you were adjacent to
      them, and do not provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement.</p>

      <p>For every 5 ranks in a skill associated with your current movement mode
      you possess, creatures are pushed 5 feet farther and you treat creatures
      as being 1 size smaller than they actually are for the purpose of being
      affected by Windwake.</p>
