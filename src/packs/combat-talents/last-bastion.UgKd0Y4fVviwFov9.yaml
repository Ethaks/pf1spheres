      <p>Your words are often the last thing an ally hears before victory. The
      first time an ally within range of your boast would be reduced to 0 or
      fewer hit points during the next minute, they gain a number of temporary
      hit points equal to your ranks in Intimidate + your practitioner modifier
      which last one minute. Creatures with temporary hit points granted to them
      by this ability do not fall unconscious until these temporary hit points
      are lost.</p>
