      <p>When you tame a creature, you may automatically grant them one general
      purpose from the Handle Animal skill. For every 4 ranks in Handle Animal
      you possess, you can teach tamed creatures 1 additional trick using the
      Handle Animal skill. In addition, any trick learned from a general purpose
      does not count against the maximum number of tricks a tamed creature can
      learn. If you possess the Broad Skills talent, you do not increase the
      Handle Animal DC to teach a trick or grant a general purpose to a creature
      that does not possess the animal type.</p>

      <p>You may retrain feats, skill ranks, and other options possessed by an
      animal ally. You may retrain one feat, general purpose, trick, or a number
      of skill ranks equal to your ranks in Handle Animal with 4 hours of
      training. The new feats and skills must be appropriate for the animal
      ally. Animal allies treat the Extra Combat Talent feat as an appropriate
      feat when retraining this way, even if it is not a practitioner, although
      some spheres are more appropriate for certain creatures than others. The
      GM is the final arbiter of what feats and skills are suitable for an
      animal ally. With 8 hours of training, you may instead retrain a number of
      feats equal to half your ranks in Handle Animal (minimum 2 feats).</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may retrain anything your animal ally
      possesses that could be retrained normally, and the examples presented in
      the Purposeful Training talent is not exhaustive. For example, a
      practitioner with this talent could retrain combat talents chosen by an
      animal companion with the martial beast archetype (Champions of the
      Spheres).</p>
