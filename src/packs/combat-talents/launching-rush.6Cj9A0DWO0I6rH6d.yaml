      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brute sphere, base attack bonus
      +10.</p>

      <p>Whenever you attempt an awesome blow, bull rush, drag, or reposition
      combat maneuver against a creature (and requires at least a standard
      action), you can expend your martial focus to have the creature be pushed
      back an additional 5 feet for every 2 by which your attack exceeds their
      CMD, instead of every 5. When used with talents that would deal damage
      based on colliding with an object or creature (such as the Hammer Brute
      sphere talent), this damage is not increased based on any excess movement
      made by this talent.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Launching Uppercut Boxing sphere talent, you may use
      this ability when applying the talent to your counterpunch, and without
      expending a second instance of martial focus. The amount of fall damage
      dealt when using this talent cannot exceed 1d6 per point of base attack
      bonus you possess.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Tombstone Burial legendary Wrestling sphere talent,
      you increase the amount of distance traveled underground by 5 feet for
      every 2 points of base attack bonus you possess, instead of every 5.</p>
