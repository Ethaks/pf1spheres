      <p>You may perform a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver as a
      move action instead of a standard action. You must still have movement
      remaining in a round in order to move with your target, such as your
      5-foot step.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus to perform a bull rush, drag, or
      reposition as a swift action.</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, whenever you perform a bull rush, drag, or
      reposition combat maneuver as a move action, you may move with the
      creature as part of that action; in essence, using the action both to move
      and perform the maneuver.</p>
