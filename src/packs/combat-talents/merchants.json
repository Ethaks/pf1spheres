      "value": "<p>Your followers includes merchants that can trade with you. Treat your followers as a settlement with a size according to your ranks in Diplomacy per <strong>Table: Merchant Equivalent Settlement Size</strong> to determine what items can be purchased and sold. Note that if a roll for availability determines that a given item is not available, another roll for that item cannot be attempted until having passed a settlement, traveling merchants, or other potential source of resupply.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when in a settlement, your followers collectively make Profession checks using your Diplomacy modifier, earning you the check result in gold pieces each week. This stacks with earnings from other talents.</p>\n<p>Any Appraise checks made while with the followers automatically gain a +2 circumstance bonus from the merchants&#8217; aid. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess.</p>\n<p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may generate Goods or Influence capital in place of earning gold, with 10 gp equaling 1 Good or 15 gp equaling 1 Influence. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>\n<strong>Table: Merchant Equivalent Settlement Size</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Diplomacy Ranks</th>\n<th>Effective Settlement Size</th>\n<th>Base Value</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Hamlet</td>\n<td>200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Village</td>\n<td>500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Small town</td>\n<td>1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Large town</td>\n<td>2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Small city</td>\n<td>4,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Large city</td>\n<td>8,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>Metropolis</td>\n<td>16,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Settlement Base Value:</strong> The base value of a settlement is used to determine what magic items may be easily purchased there. There is a 75% chance that any item of that value or lower can be found for sale in the settlement with little effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The Merchant Equivalent Settlement Size comes from Ultimate Campaign, and does not include a settlement's purchase limit, only their base value (the number determined what price of goods are available). The Settlement Statistics from the GameMastery Guide provide a purchase limit for a settlement as usually being about 5 times the base value; this number determines the total value of goods that can be sold to the Merchants followers. The Merchants followers purchase limit is reset whenever their inventory would be reset (passing a settlement, traveling merchants, or other potential source of resupply).</p>\n",
