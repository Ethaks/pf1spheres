      "value": "<p>Your followers have many contacts in the criminal underworld. You gain the following abilities in any settlement in which your followers have been in for at least 1 day.</p>\n<p><strong>Fence:</strong> You may sell stolen goods at their normal sale value without paying any additional fees to a fence.</p>\n<p><strong>Grease Palms:</strong> In any settlement of at least 5,000 inhabitants, you may locate a corrupt official. If you&#8217;re imprisoned or fined for crimes committed in the settlement&#8217;s jurisdiction, you may take advantage of this contact.</p>\n<p>You pay no fines and escape sentencing if you can make a Diplomacy check (DC 15 for petty crimes, 25 for serious crimes, or 35 for capital crimes). You can use this ability once per settlement per week.</p>\n<p><strong>Theft:</strong> Choose an item with a cost not greater than 100 gp per rank in Diplomacy. Your followers can obtain that item at half price in 2d6 hours if it is available in a settlement they occupy. If given 2d6 days, this value increases to 1,000 gp per rank. Your followers may only steal one item at a time. Note that items that are unique or readily identifiable to their former owners will attract official attention and possible legal (or extra-legal) repercussions commensurate with the value of the item taken. Unique items may require time in excess of their material value or even be unobtainable according to the GM&#8217;s judgement. The key to the county lock-up is more difficult to steal than a generic potion, so could be assigned a value in excess of the cost of a generic key according to the effort and time required to obtain it. The crystal key attuned to open the archmage&#8217;s dimensional sanctum is probably beyond the capabilities of your followers to obtain.</p>\n<p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers reduce the influence cost of illegal downtime activities, such as alibi, blackmail, coerce, and heist (all found in Pathfinder Player Companion: Black Markets) in a settlement that they are present in by 1, +1 per 4 ranks in Diplomacy.</p>\n",
