      <p>You may attack the ground around you with a savage blow. You may make a
      brutal strike against the corner of a square within your reach as a
      full-round action. You may reduce this to a standard action by expending
      martial focus. This attack automatically hits and deals damage normally.
      If you manage to deal more damage than the floor&#8217;s hardness, you
      cause a 5 ft. radius, 10 ft. cone, or 15 ft. line (your choice) to become
      difficult terrain. Radius&#8217; increase by 5 ft. per 10 base attack
      bonus, cones by 5 ft. per 5 base attack bonus, and lines by 10 ft. per 5
      base attack bonus. A square can be cleared as a standard action (provoking
      an attack of opportunity) or repaired with a spell or effect such as the
      mending spell or the repair ability of the Creation sphere to no longer be
      difficult terrain.</p>

      <p>Creatures within the affected area become battered for 1 round. If a
      creature is already battered, it must make a Reflex save or be knocked
      prone.</p>

      <p>If your attack is enough to destroy the floor, you may activate the
      Shrapnel talent, if you possess it. If the floor has a set thickness (for
      example, attacking the floor on a building&#8217;s second story),
      destroying the floor eliminates the targeted area, opening a hole. If
      attacking a floor with no set thickness (for example, the ground outside),
      treat the floor as being 1 ft. thick when determining its hp, and if
      destroyed, the difficult terrain cannot be cleared away unless the ground
      is repaired. You may choose to leave the floor at 1 hit point instead of
      destroying it.</p>
