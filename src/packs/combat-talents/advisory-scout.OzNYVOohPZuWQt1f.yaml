    value: >
      <p>You may scout a creature as a standard action, simultaneously scouting
      the creature and informing your allies of what you found. Allies within 60
      feet that can hear you or otherwise communicate with you gain the benefits
      of your scout ability against the scouted creature for 1 round, plus 1
      additional round per 4 ranks in Perception.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Advisory Scout shares the benefits of
      "passive" Scout sphere talents, such as Find Gap and Identify Rhythms.
      This talent does not share Scout sphere talents which grant active
      abilities against scouted targets (such as Target Weakness) or other
      non-Scout sphere abilities which would augment the scout ability.</p>
