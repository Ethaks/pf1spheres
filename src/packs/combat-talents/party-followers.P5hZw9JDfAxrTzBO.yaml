    value: >
      <p>In some games, especially those focused on a traveling group larger
      than a normal adventuring party, rather than have one player shoulder the
      burden of spending character resources to have a group of followers and
      cohorts, the party as a whole could be allowed to gain talents. This could
      be done in various ways, such as allowing each PC to contribute talents
      into a group pool. One &#8216;leader&#8217; would take the base sphere and
      benefit from the bonus skill ranks, while others could add additional
      talents, reflecting the cohorts and followers they attract with their
      skills. Anyone who possesses a (cohort) talent would be able to use it
      with any of the shared party cohorts.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, the base sphere could simply be granted to the group,
      with bonus skill ranks removed, then additional talents granted at
      appropriate intervals based on level, achievement, or wealth (either
      accumulated or spent). This can be used to reflect being part of a
      mercenary company, trading caravan, or other group.</p>
