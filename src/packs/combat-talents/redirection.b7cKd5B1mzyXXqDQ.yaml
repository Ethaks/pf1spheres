      <p>When making a barrage, you may use an extra attack to strike one of
      your other attacks, changing its course mid-flight. Rather than making
      this extra attack, another of your attacks may instead change course once,
      allowing you to strike around corners, bypass cover, or perform other,
      similar feats.</p>
