      <p>Choose one cohort. That cohort gains an additional combat talent. You
      may take this talent more than once; each time one cohort gains another
      talent. If the chosen cohort dies or leaves your service, you may retrain
      the selection made to grant a talent to another cohort at no cost as part
      of recruiting a new cohort (if applying to a new cohort) or with 1 hour of
      training per talent (if applying to an existing cohort).</p>
