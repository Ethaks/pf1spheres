    value: >
      <p>Whenever you are wielding two or more weapons, you can choose to use
      the dual attack ability (taking the attack penalty for doing so), but only
      make a single attack. If you do, once per round whenever a creature makes
      a melee attack against you, you can spend an attack of opportunity to make
      an attack roll as if you were making an attack of opportunity, but for
      each size category the attacking creature is larger than you, you take a
      &#8211;2 penalty on this roll. If your result is greater than the
      attacking creature&#8217;s result, the creature&#8217;s attack
      automatically misses. At base attack bonus +10, if you successfully force
      an attack to miss with this talent, you can make an attack against the
      creature who&#8217;s attack you forced to miss.</p>
