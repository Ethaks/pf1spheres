    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully attack with your counter punch, you may
      expend your martial focus to attempt a bull rush against the creature as a
      free action even while it is not your turn without provoking an attack of
      opportunity. A successful bull rush forces the creature an additional 5
      ft. further than normal, and you may choose to force the creature to move
      vertically rather than horizontally (this movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity). If you choose to force the creature vertically,
      that creature begins to descend on the end of their current turn
      (creatures that can fly may attempt to do so); upon landing, they must
      make a successful Reflex save or fall prone, taking falling damage as
      appropriate (on a successful Reflex save, they take 1/2 the total amount
      of falling damage and do not fall prone).</p>

      <p>You may use this talent on a willing ally other than yourself without
      expending your martial focus, dealing no damage to them and automatically
      hitting them. A willing ally treats their CMD as 10, adjusted for size.
      Willing allies can control their descent as though they could glide (until
      they reach the same elevation at which they started, falling as normal
      after that) and make an attack at any point during their descent; for
      every 10 ft. your ally descends before making this attack, they gain a +2
      circumstance bonus to its damage roll. For every 4 points of base attack
      bonus you possess, you may launch a creature 10 ft. further into the
      air.</p>
