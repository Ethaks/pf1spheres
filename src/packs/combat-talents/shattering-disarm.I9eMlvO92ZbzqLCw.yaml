      <p>Whenever you succeed at a disarm attempt against a creature, you may
      make a sunder attempt against the disarmed weapon as a swift action,
      treating the weapon as an unattended object for the attempt; if the
      disarmed creature is currently taking bleed damage, you may instead make
      this sunder attempt as an attack of opportunity.</p>
