      <p>When you use this shout, all hostile creatures within its radius must
      succeed on a Will saving throw or be shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear
      effect. This talent may be taken up to twice; the second time this talent
      is taken, any creature affected by this shout who is already shaken is
      instead frightened for the shout&#8217;s duration.</p>
