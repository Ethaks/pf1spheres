      <p>When you attempt a check for a skill associated with an Athletics
      sphere package you possess, your armor check penalty on that check for
      wearing armor you are proficient in is reduced by 2. For every 4 ranks in
      the skill associated with the package you possess, the penalty is further
      reduced by 1 (this cannot reduce your armor check penalty below 0). The
      benefits granted by this talent do not stack with those provided by the
      Armored Athlete feat. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Armored
      Athlete.</p>
