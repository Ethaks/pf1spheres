      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Lancer sphere, base attack bonus
      +7.</p>

      <p>Whenever you control a weapon that is impaling a creature and either
      you or the impaled creature are targeted by a single-targeted magic sphere
      effect that requires a Fortitude or Will save, or any harmless effect, you
      can choose to redirect the effect to either yourself or the impaled
      creature as an immediate action (before any saving throw is made). The
      impaled creature must succeed at a Will saving throw to negate an effect
      being redirected this way. You may only redirect an effect using this
      talent if the impaled creature has at least half as much Hit Dice as your
      character level.</p>
