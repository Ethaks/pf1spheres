      <p>You gain an animal companion as the druid class feature. Your effective
      druid level for this companion is the highest between your base attack
      bonus, Handle Animal ranks, or Ride ranks - 3 (minimum 1). Your companion
      always counts as an animal ally. If you possess the Broad Skills talent,
      you may instead choose a plant or vermin companion.</p>

      <p>Should you release your companion or your companion dies, you may gain
      a new companion after 1 week. If you are in the environment where the new
      companion typically lives, you may instead gain that new companion in 24
      hours.</p>

      <p>In addition, your companion is always considered combat trained and
      gains Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. If the companion is
      suitable to serve as a mount, you do not take an armor check penalty on
      Ride checks while riding this companion. This talent counts as possessing
      the mount class feature.</p>

      <p>Abilities that grant talents temporarily can not be used to gain this
      talent, such as taking the Extra Combat Talent feat with martial
      flexibility or gaining it from an armiger&#8217;s customized weapon.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a second time. If you do, your effective druid
      level when determining the effects of this talent becomes equal to the
      highest between your base attack bonus, ranks in Handle Animal, or ranks
      in Ride.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Animal Ally, Boon Companion (if
      taken twice).</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you already possess a companion, or gain
      one at a later time from another source, you gain the benefits of this
      talent as if taken twice. Your effective druid level from this talent
      stacks with those from other sources, to a maximum of your character
      level.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Effects that increase effective BAB
      ranks in a sphere do not accelerate the strength of animal companions or
      similar partners, just as increasing your caster level does not accelerate
      the hit dice of Conjuration sphere companions. Only effects that actually
      raise your effective level, such as the Spherebound mythic quality or the
      Beastmastery Conscript sphere specialization, can further raise your
      effective druid level for this ability (and any other similar
      abilities).</sup></p>
