      <p>If you have successfully used the scout ability to identify a
      target&#8217;s weaknesses, you may use scavenged materials collected as
      you travel to improvise a weapon targeting one of those weaknesses as a
      move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity; you may expend
      your martial focus to instead use this ability as a free action. The next
      attack you make against the target with a manufactured or natural weapon
      attack, including traps, is treated as though half the total damage it
      deals (rounded down) were of an energy type the target has vulnerability
      to (for example, if you fire an arrow at a red dragon, who has
      vulnerability to cold damage, and would normally deal 14 points of
      piercing damage, you instead deal 7 points of piercing damage and 10
      points of cold damage); if this attack is not made before the end of your
      next turn, this effect is wasted.</p>

      <p>Additional energy damage dealt by the attack, such as from the flaming
      or frost weapon special abilities, is calculated separately from this
      effect. Alternatively, your weapons are treated as having one type listed
      in the target&#8217;s damage reduction (for example, if an enemy has DR
      5/cold iron or good, you may treat your attacks as either good or cold
      iron for 1 round).</p>
