      <p>Whenever you initiate an attack against a creature while they are
      unaware of your presence due to your use of Stealth, you deal additional
      precision damage to the target equal to 1/2 your ranks in Stealth (minimum
      1) with your first attack. If you have successfully used the scout ability
      to identify the target&#8217;s weaknesses, you instead deal additional
      precision damage equal to your ranks in Stealth.</p>
