      (Armored Drop x2, Titan&#8217;s Fall).</p>

      <p>When using the Armored Drop talent, any damage dealt by that talent
      bypasses damage reduction as though it were a weapon made of the same
      material of your armor. If your armor is made of adamantine it bypasses
      hardness less than 20.</p>
