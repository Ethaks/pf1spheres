      <p>A creature that fails its Reflex save to avoid this snare is subject to
      a dirty trick maneuver as if the trap successfully beat their CMD. This
      counts as you performing the dirty trick for the purposes of Scoundrel
      sphere abilities that depend on you triggering the dirty trick. Creatures
      targeted by this trap get a +1 circumstance bonus on their saving throw
      for each size category they are larger than Medium.</p>
