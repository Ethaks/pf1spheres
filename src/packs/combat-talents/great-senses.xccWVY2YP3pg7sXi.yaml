      <p>You gain 5 ranks in the Perception skill, plus 5 ranks per additional
      talent spent in the Scout sphere (maximum ranks equal to your total Hit
      Dice). If you already have ranks in the Perception skill you may
      immediately retrain them, but you do not get to retrain when only
      temporarily gaining talents, such as through the armiger&#8217;s
      customized weapons class feature.</p>
