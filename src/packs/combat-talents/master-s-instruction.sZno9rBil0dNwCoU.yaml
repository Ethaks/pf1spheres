      <p>While in this stance, whenever you damage a creature with an attack
      action or attack of opportunity, you may expend an attack of opportunity
      to use the aid another action targeting a cohort with close range (25 feet
      + 5 feet per 2 ranks in Diplomacy) as a free action that can be taken even
      outside of your turn. The aid another action increases the attack roll of
      their next attack directed at the creature damaged by you as long as that
      attack comes before the beginning of your next turn.</p>
