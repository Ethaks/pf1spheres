      <p>When striking a target twice with the same barrage, the target has
      their initiative check reduced by -5 when determining when they act in
      this combat, changing that creature&#8217;s order in initiative for a
      number of rounds equal to your practitioner modifier. If the creature
      hasn&#8217;t made an initiative check yet, their initiative roll takes
      this penalty as long as this initiative check is made within 1 minute.
      This (blitz) does not stack with itself.</p>
