      <p>You gain a group of followers. These followers will not accompany you
      into dangerous locations, but can lend assistance in various ways.
      Followers can supply unskilled labor for simple tasks, such as clearing a
      road obstructed by falling rocks. Count the followers as supplying a
      number of Medium-sized unskilled laborers equal to half the number of
      followers in the settlement (or caravan). While doing so, the followers
      cannot provide their other benefits. If attacked, followers will attempt
      to flee to a safe place to the best of their ability. You normally have
      about 5 followers per rank in Diplomacy. If statistics are needed for a
      particular follower, treat them as level 1 commoners.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Alchemists, Craftsmen, Entertainers, Healers,
      Merchants, Rangers, or Scholars talents, then there is a 10% chance per
      talent that a randomly selected follower will be a level 1 expert. When
      you gain this package, choose a settlement with which you are well
      acquainted. Your initial followers are drawn from there. When first
      gaining this package, it is assumed that you have spent time in the past
      making contacts, deals, and promises and that you are well known enough in
      the community to attract a group of followers.</p>

      <p>Should the number of followers available be reduced for any reason, the
      effectiveness of (followers) talents is reduced, treating your ranks in
      Diplomacy as equal to the number of available followers/4. You normally
      regain 1 follower per rank in Diplomacy each day you spend in a settlement
      where your followers are dispersed, but you can double this number with 8
      hours of active effort each day. If you have lost all of your followers or
      do not disperse your followers in the settlement, the recruitment rate is
      halved (minimum 1 follower per day).</p>

      <p>If using the downtime rules found in Ultimate Campaign, having your
      followers present in a settlement increases the effect of Influence or
      Labor you spend by 50%, to a maximum of 1 additional Influence or Labor
      for every 2 followers in the settlement where the downtime activity takes
      place. Any talents that enable followers to make checks to generate
      capital receive any benefits from rooms and teams you have access to. If a
      talent allows followers to generate capital, the entire group of followers
      makes this check collectively. Any results that are not sufficient to
      generate capital on a given day may be carried over to the next day; this
      carrying-over may be continued until the result is sufficient to generate
      capital or your followers leave the settlement.</p>

      <p>If using the kingdom building rules found in Ultimate Campaign,
      possessing this package grants a +1 bonus to all kingdom attributes you
      affect.</p>

      <p>When you first gain the follower package, you gain the following
