      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere.</p>\n<p>When moving more than 5 ft. during your turn using the movement mode corresponding to a package you possess, the speed of your motion causes you to leave behind an afterimage, which may foil your foe&#8217;s attacks. If you move more than 20 ft., you may expend your martial focus as a free action to leave behind an additional afterimage. These afterimages disappear at the start of your next turn. For every 6 ranks in Acrobatics you possess, you may leave an additional afterimage.</p>\n<p>Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your afterimages instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or an afterimage.</p>\n<p>If it is an afterimage, the afterimage is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your afterimages is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your afterimages. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your afterimages. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy an afterimage.</p>\n<p>An attacker must be able to see the afterimages to be fooled. If you are invisible or the attacker is blind, this ability has no effect (although the normal miss chances still apply).</p>\n",
