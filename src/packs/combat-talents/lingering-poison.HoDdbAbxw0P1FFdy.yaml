      <p>Your poisons remain potent by an additional number of rounds equal to
      your practitioner modifier. You can expend martial focus when you create a
      poison with one of the following additional effects:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>If it was a contact, ingested or injury poison, a creature that
      successfully saves against the poison must attempt new saving throws
      against the poison at the beginning of their turn for a number of rounds
      equal to your practitioner modifier or until the creature fails their
      saving throw.</li>

      <li>If it was an inhaled poison the area it affects when thrown remains
      poisoned for a number of rounds equal to your practitioner modifier;
      creatures that enter or begin their turns in this area must attempt a save
      against this poison (a creature only needs to attempt a save against this
      poison once per round, regardless of how many times it might enter the
      poisoned area).</li>

      </ul>
