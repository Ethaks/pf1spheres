    value: >
      <p>You can deal lethal damage with a whip and can also damage creatures
      regardless of their armor or natural armor bonus. In addition, you
      threaten all spaces within 5 ft. of yourself and do not provoke an attack
      of opportunity while making an attack with a whip.</p>

      <p>As a standard action, you may use your whip to manipulate an unattended
      object up to 15 ft. away as if you were adjacent to it. You are limited to
      manipulations you could accomplish in a single move action using only one
      hand.</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, you instead threaten all spaces within 10 ft.
      of yourself. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Whip Mastery, Improved Whip
      Mastery.</p>
