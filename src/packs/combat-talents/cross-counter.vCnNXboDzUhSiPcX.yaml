      <p>Whenever a creature within your reach makes an attack of opportunity
      against you, you can expend your martial focus as an immediate action to
      make an attack against them dealing damage as normal; if your attack is
      successful, the creature must roll their attack roll twice, taking the
      worse result.</p>
