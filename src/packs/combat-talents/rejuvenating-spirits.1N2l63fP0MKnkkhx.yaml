      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Barroom sphere (Good For What Ails Ya),
      base attack bonus +6.</p>

      <p>So long as you have the drunk status, you gain fast healing equal to
      1/2 your base attack bonus. This healing cannot increase your hit points
      above 1/2 of your maximum hit point total, and is suppressed for 1 round
      if you would suffer cold or negative energy damage.</p>

      <p>At +15 base attack bonus, the fast healing becomes regeneration (cold
      or negative energy), which still cannot increase your hit points above 1/2
      your maximum hit point total.</p>
