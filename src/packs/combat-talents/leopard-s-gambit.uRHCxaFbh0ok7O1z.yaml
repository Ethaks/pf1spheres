      <p>While in this stance, whenever a creature makes a melee attack against
      you, you may allow the creature to roll its attack twice, taking the
      better result. If you do, the creature provokes an attack of opportunity
      from you after the attack and damage is determined. You must make this
      attack of opportunity with an unarmed strike. If the creature attacking
      you is battered, you may resolve your attack of opportunity prior to their
      attack being resolved. This talent cannot be used in conjunction with the
      Bloody Counter talent.</p>
