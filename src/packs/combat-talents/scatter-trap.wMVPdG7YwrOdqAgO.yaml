      <p>When you place a trap, increase the area it normally occupies by an
      additional contiguous 5-foot space for every 4 ranks in Craft (traps) you
      possess (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>In addition you can expend your martial focus when placing a trap to
      not have the spaces occupied by the trap be contiguous, but all must
      remain at least within close distance of one another (25 feet + 5 feet per
      2 ranks of Craft (traps) you possess).</p>
