      <p>Your followers includes merchants that can trade with you. Treat your
      followers as a settlement with a size according to your ranks in Diplomacy
      per <strong>Table: Merchant Equivalent Settlement Size</strong> to
      determine what items can be purchased and sold. Note that if a roll for
      availability determines that a given item is not available, another roll
      for that item cannot be attempted until having passed a settlement,
      traveling merchants, or other potential source of resupply.</p>

      <p>Additionally, when in a settlement, your followers collectively make
      Profession checks using your Diplomacy modifier, earning you the check
      result in gold pieces each week. This stacks with earnings from other
      talents.</p>

      <p>Any Appraise checks made while with the followers automatically gain a
      +2 circumstance bonus from the merchants&#8217; aid. This bonus increases
      by +1 for every 8 ranks in Diplomacy that you possess.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Goods or Influence capital in place of earning gold, with 10 gp
      equaling 1 Good or 15 gp equaling 1 Influence. Use your Diplomacy modifier
      for making the earnings checks. This stacks with capital gains from other
      talents.</p>

      <p><strong>Settlement Base Value:</strong> The base value of a settlement
      is used to determine what magic items may be easily purchased there. There
      is a 75% chance that any item of that value or lower can be found for sale
      in the settlement with little effort.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The Merchant Equivalent Settlement Size
      comes from Ultimate Campaign, and does not include a settlement's purchase
      limit, only their base value (the number determined what price of goods
      are available). The Settlement Statistics from the GameMastery Guide
      provide a purchase limit for a settlement as usually being about 5 times
      the base value; this number determines the total value of goods that can
      be sold to the Merchants followers. The Merchants followers purchase limit
      is reset whenever their inventory would be reset (passing a settlement,
      traveling merchants, or other potential source of resupply).</p>
