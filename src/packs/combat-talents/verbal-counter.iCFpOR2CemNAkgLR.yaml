    value: >
      <p>While outside of combat, whenever a creature makes a Bluff check
      against you that involves speaking, you can make a Bluff, Diplomacy, or
      Intimidate check opposed by their Bluff check; upon making a successful
      opposed check, you can force them to either tell the truth (as far as they
      know) about the subject or take a -5 penalty on Charisma-based skill and
      ability checks (this includes Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate, even if
      the target uses an alternate ability score to determine their bonuses with
      these skills) against everyone who listened to them speak for 1 day.</p>
