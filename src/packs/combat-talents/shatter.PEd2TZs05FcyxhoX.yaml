    value: >
      <p>You may break a weapon when attacking a creature to deal 1d4 points of
      additional damage on that attack. This damage is multiplied on a critical
      hit. This additional damage increases by an additional 1d4 for every 4
      base attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p>If you threaten a critical hit while using this talent, you gain a +4
      bonus on the roll to confirm the critical hit, and if it is confirmed, the
      weapon is destroyed. If you apply a second effect that would give your
      weapon the broken condition, you forgo this additional benefit.
      <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Chairbreaker.</p>
