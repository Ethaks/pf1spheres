    value: >
      <p>Whenever you make an attack with an unarmed strike while prone, the
      penalty to attack rolls is reduced by 2. In addition, you may spend an
      immediate action to stand up from being prone without provoking an attack
      of opportunity as a part of an attack action made with an unarmed strike,
      dealing an additional +2 damage. At +10 base attack bonus, this additional
      damage increases to +5 and you no longer take a penalty on attack rolls
      made with unarmed strikes while prone.</p>
