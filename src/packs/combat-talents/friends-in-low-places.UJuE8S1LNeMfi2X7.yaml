      <p>Your followers have many contacts in the criminal underworld. You gain
      the following abilities in any settlement in which your followers have
      been in for at least 1 day.</p>

      <p><strong>Fence:</strong> You may sell stolen goods at their normal sale
      value without paying any additional fees to a fence.</p>

      <p><strong>Grease Palms:</strong> In any settlement of at least 5,000
      inhabitants, you may locate a corrupt official. If you&#8217;re imprisoned
      or fined for crimes committed in the settlement&#8217;s jurisdiction, you
      may take advantage of this contact.</p>

      <p>You pay no fines and escape sentencing if you can make a Diplomacy
      check (DC 15 for petty crimes, 25 for serious crimes, or 35 for capital
      crimes). You can use this ability once per settlement per week.</p>

      <p><strong>Theft:</strong> Choose an item with a cost not greater than 100
      gp per rank in Diplomacy. Your followers can obtain that item at half
      price in 2d6 hours if it is available in a settlement they occupy. If
      given 2d6 days, this value increases to 1,000 gp per rank. Your followers
      may only steal one item at a time. Note that items that are unique or
      readily identifiable to their former owners will attract official
      attention and possible legal (or extra-legal) repercussions commensurate
      with the value of the item taken. Unique items may require time in excess
      of their material value or even be unobtainable according to the
      GM&#8217;s judgement. The key to the county lock-up is more difficult to
      steal than a generic potion, so could be assigned a value in excess of the
      cost of a generic key according to the effort and time required to obtain
      it. The crystal key attuned to open the archmage&#8217;s dimensional
      sanctum is probably beyond the capabilities of your followers to
      obtain.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers
      reduce the influence cost of illegal downtime activities, such as alibi,
      blackmail, coerce, and heist (all found in Pathfinder Player Companion:
      Black Markets) in a settlement that they are present in by 1, +1 per 4
      ranks in Diplomacy.</p>
