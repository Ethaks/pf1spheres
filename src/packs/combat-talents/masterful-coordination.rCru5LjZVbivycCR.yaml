      <p>Allies within range of this tactic can use the aid another action to
      provide a +3 bonus on attack rolls or to AC to any ally benefiting from
      this tactic against an opponent that ally threatens, increasing by +1 for
      every 10 ranks of Diplomacy you possess. The bonus from aid another lasts
      until the beginning of the aiding ally&#8217;s next turn. The bonus to aid
      another actions granted by Masterful Coordination does not stack with
      other feats, class features, or effects that improve the bonus provided by
      the aid another action.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent twice. If taken a second time, allies
      benefiting from this tactic may expend their martial focus as a swift
      action to perform the aid another action. In addition, allies may use the
      aid another action on any ally within range of this tactic and may aid
      them against any opponent also within range of this tactic, instead of
      only against opponents the targeted ally threatens.</p>
