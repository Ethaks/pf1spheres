      <p>As an immediate action, when a creature comes within the area of effect
      of one of your traps, you may trigger a trap. Additionally, when a
      creature succeeds on a Reflex save to avoid triggering one of your snare
      traps, you may force them to reroll the save as an immediate action. You
      must be within close range (25 ft. plus 5 ft. per 2 ranks in Craft
      (traps)) of the trap to use either ability.</p>

      <p>If you select the remote trigger talent a second time, you may trigger
      your trap from medium range of your trap (100 feet + 10 feet per rank in
      Craft (trap)), and without requiring a creature to enter the area of
      effect for your trap. Lastly you may set your trap to trigger on a timer
      after a set amount of time after it is placed (but no longer than its base
      duration). If the trap can activate multiple times, you can set the time
      for each activation individually. [Apoc] <sup><strong>Source:</strong> <a
