      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 20</p>

      <p>You create a vial of potent liquid that can be used as a potion,
      removing 1d4 points of ability damage to one ability score of your choice
      (chosen when used). You can only affect a particular creature with this
      ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 the number of ranks you
      possess in Craft (alchemy) (minimum 1) plus your practitioner
      modifier.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 5, each
      time you do so, you may apply one of the following benefits:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You may affect an additional ability score of your choice to benefit
      from this formulae.</li>

      <li>You remove 2 points of ability drain to the affected ability
      score(s).</li>

      <li>The amount healed increases by one die size (1d6, 1d8, 1d10,
      1d12).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If a chosen benefit is chosen more than once, its effects stack.</p>
