      "value": "<p>You gain an animal companion as the druid class feature. Your effective druid level for this companion is the highest between your base attack bonus, Handle Animal ranks, or Ride ranks - 3 (minimum 1). Your companion always counts as an animal ally. If you possess the Broad Skills talent, you may instead choose a plant or vermin companion.</p>\n<p>Should you release your companion or your companion dies, you may gain a new companion after 1 week. If you are in the environment where the new companion typically lives, you may instead gain that new companion in 24 hours.</p>\n<p>In addition, your companion is always considered combat trained and gains Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. If the companion is suitable to serve as a mount, you do not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding this companion. This talent counts as possessing the mount class feature.</p>\n<p>Abilities that grant talents temporarily can not be used to gain this talent, such as taking the Extra Combat Talent feat with martial flexibility or gaining it from an armiger&#8217;s customized weapon.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent a second time. If you do, your effective druid level when determining the effects of this talent becomes equal to the highest between your base attack bonus, ranks in Handle Animal, or ranks in Ride.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Animal Ally, Boon Companion (if taken twice).</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> If you already possess a companion, or gain one at a later time from another source, you gain the benefits of this talent as if taken twice. Your effective druid level from this talent stacks with those from other sources, to a maximum of your character level.</p>\n<p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Effects that increase effective BAB ranks in a sphere do not accelerate the strength of animal companions or similar partners, just as increasing your caster level does not accelerate the hit dice of Conjuration sphere companions. Only effects that actually raise your effective level, such as the Spherebound mythic quality or the Beastmastery Conscript sphere specialization, can further raise your effective druid level for this ability (and any other similar abilities).</sup></p>\n",
