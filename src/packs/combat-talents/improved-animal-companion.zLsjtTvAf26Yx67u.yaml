      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Beastmastery sphere; animal companion,
      mount, or other similar ability; additional requirements (see
      details).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> When selecting your animal companion or
      mount, you can choose from special creatures to serve as your improved
      companion, such as creatures from the Beast Speaker feat (Heroes of
      Golarion), Monstrous Mount feat (Inner Sea Combat), or other similar
      source. An improved companion chosen using this talent advances the same
      way as detailed in the ability that grants you access to your animal
      companion or mount (such as a druid&#8217;s animal companion,
      cavalier&#8217;s mount, paladin&#8217;s divine bond, or the Beastmastery
      sphere Animal Companion talent).</p>

      <p>You can also dismiss an improved companion, as dictated by your class
      feature. Subject to GM discretion, other special creatures can be made
      available with this feat. If a chosen improved companion has
      prerequisites, as described in its entry, you must meet any additional
      prerequisites to select that improved companion. For example, to select a
      behir available through the Beast Speaker feat, you must have 7 ranks in
      either Diplomacy or Intimidate and 7 ranks in Knowledge (arcana).</p>

      <p>An improved companion chosen with this talent gains additional
      abilities and bonuses listed in the mastery entry in its stat block when
      your effective druid level is equal to or higher than that
      companion&#8217;s indicated mastery level. If you dismiss an improved
      companion and gain a new creature of a different type, your effective
      druid levels may not be a sufficient level to gain that creature&#8217;s
      mastery benefits.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Beast Speaker, Beast Speaker
      Mastery, Monstrous Mount, Monstrous Mount Mastery.</p>

      <p><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Some improved animal companions can be
      found in the <a href="/sphere-bestiary">Sphere Bestiary</a>, including in
      the Monster Collections.</p>
