      <p>Some talents possess the (smash) tag, allowing you to grant an
      improvised weapon or weapon with the fragile special feature the broken
      condition in exchange for a benefit, known as a break. If you would apply
      such a benefit to a weapon that has the broken condition, it is destroyed.
      If you would use a (smash) talent in conjunction with a ranged weapon, the
      ranged weapon gains the broken quality and not its ammunition. You can
      only break an improvised weapon that is made of a material with a hardness
      of 5 or lower (wood, glass, etc.). You cannot break magic items or
      creatures being used as improvised weapons.</p>

      <p>You may only use one (smash) talent as part of a given action (such as
      part of an attack or in response to another effect); if you would use a
      (smash) talent as part of an action that would involve multiple attack
      rolls (such as a full-round attack or a barrage), the (smash) talent only
      applies to the first attack. If a (smash) talent would have you break a
      weapon as part of an attack, you must break the weapon being used to
      attack.</p>
