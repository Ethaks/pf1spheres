      <p>Whenever a creature within your natural reach makes an attack against
      you with a manufactured melee weapon, you can expend your martial focus as
      an immediate action to perform a steal combat maneuver against that
      creature to attempt to disarm them of the weapon being used for the attack
      before the attack resolves, although any bonuses the target possesses
      against disarm checks, such as wearing a locked gauntlet, apply to their
      CMD against this maneuver.</p>
