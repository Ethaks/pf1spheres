    value: >
      <p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever you reduce a creature to 0
      hit points or fewer with a melee or thrown weapon attack, you may
      immediately make a bonus attack against another creature with a melee or
      thrown weapon. If you are capable of drawing a weapon as a free action,
      you may draw such a weapon as part of making this attack. You may only
      make one extra attack per round with this talent, increasing by 1 time per
      round at 7 base attack bonus and 14 base attack bonus. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Cleaving Finish.</p>
