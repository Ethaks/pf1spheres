      <p>Your armor receives a competence bonus to its hardness equal to your
      base attack bonus. Your armor does not gain the broken condition until it
      is reduced to 1/4th its hit points, and when your armor would be destroyed
      you may expend your martial focus to allow it to remain broken with 1 hit
      point remaining.</p>
