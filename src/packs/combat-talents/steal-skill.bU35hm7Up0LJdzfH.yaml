      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere, Sleight of Hand 5
      ranks.</p>

      <p>When performing a steal combat maneuver, rather than steal an item, you
      may expend your martial focus to attempt to steal ranks in one skill that
      the target possesses. This does not grant you knowledge of what skills the
      target possesses; you must either know or guess a skill with ranks in
      order to steal them. If successful, the target loses all of their ranks in
      that skill for 1 round per rank in Sleight of Hand you possess, and you
      gain an equal number of skill ranks in that skill for the same duration
      (this cannot grant you more ranks in that skill than your total number of
      Hit Dice).</p>

      <p>At 10 ranks in Sleight of Hand, the duration increases to 1 minute per
      rank you possess. If something would dispel or otherwise end this effect
      prematurely on either you or the target, the effect ends for both. This is
      a supernatural effect.</p>
