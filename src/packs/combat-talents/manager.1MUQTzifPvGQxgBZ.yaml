      <p>Your followers can supply a manager for one business you own. This
      manager requires no additional pay and may make any required skill checks
      using your Diplomacy bonus in place of the normal check. At 5 ranks in
      Diplomacy and every 5 ranks thereafter, you can provide a manager for 1
      additional business.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Messengers talent, the manager can contact you via
      messengers.</p>

      <p>This talent uses the downtime rules found in Ultimate Campaign.</p>
