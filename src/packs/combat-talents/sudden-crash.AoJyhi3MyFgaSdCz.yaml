      <p>As part of making an attack, you may break a weapon. A creature damaged
      by this attack gains the battered condition until the end of your turn. If
      this attack was performed as an attack action, the damaged creature must
      also succeed at a Fortitude save or have all movement speeds they
      possessed reduced by half for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 base attack bonus
      (minimum 5 feet). A creature subject to an effect which removes the
      battered condition also removes this movement penalty.</p>
