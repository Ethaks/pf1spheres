      <p>Whenever you reload a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, you
      may decrease the required time; hand and light crossbows become free
      actions, heavy crossbows and one-handed firearms become move actions, and
      two-handed firearms become standard actions. If you possess the Crossbow
      Mastery feat, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when reloading any
      crossbow. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Rapid Reload.</p>
