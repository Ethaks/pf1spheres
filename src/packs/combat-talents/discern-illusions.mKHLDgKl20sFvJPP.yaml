      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you gain a bonus to all Will saves
      against illusions (including glamers, figments, and any effects created by
      the illusion school or the Illusion sphere) equal to 1/2 your ranks in
      Perception (minimum 1). As a swift action, you can expend martial focus to
      share this bonus with all allies within 30 ft. for a number of rounds
      equal to your practitioner modifier.</p>
