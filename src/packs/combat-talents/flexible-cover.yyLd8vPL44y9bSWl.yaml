      <p>You may spend a move action to use a shield to grant you cover until
      the beginning of your next turn. Bucklers, heavy shields, and light
      shields provide partial cover while tower shields provide total cover.
      When using a shield in this way, you must choose one edge of your space.
      That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You
      gain cover for attacks that pass through this edge. The shield does not,
      however, provide cover against targeted spells; a spellcaster can cast a
      spell on you by targeting the shield you are holding. Cover granted this
      way is insufficient to enable you to make a Stealth check to hide and the
      shield may be targeted as an attended object.</p>

      <p>As an immediate action, you may change the selected edge of your space
      even when it is not your turn. If you expend martial focus, you may use
      this talent as an immediate action.</p>
