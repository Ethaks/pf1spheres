      <p>When attacking the same target multiple times during a barrage, each
      attack after the first gains a cumulative +1 bonus against that target
      (for example, the second attack would gain a +1 bonus, the third would
      gain a +2 bonus, etc.). This cannot exceed the penalty to attack applied
      by the barrage itself.</p>
