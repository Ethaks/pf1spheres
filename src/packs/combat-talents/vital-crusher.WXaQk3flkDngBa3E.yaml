      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wrestling sphere (Limb Ripper (slam)),
      base attack bonus +15.</p>

      <p>When using the Limb Ripper talent, you can attempt to destroy the
      creature&#8217;s vitals instead of another limb. If the creature fails the
      initial Fortitude save, the creature is instantly reduced to -1 hit points
      and begins dying, in addition to suffering a -4 penalty to all saving
      throws and becoming exhausted for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>If you attempt to destroy the creature&#8217;s vitals a second time
      while the creature is suffering from these penalties, and the creature
      fails their Fortitude save, the creature&#8217;s vitals are destroyed,
      killing them. Some creatures, such as aberrations, oozes, and constructs
      do not usually possess vitals (and thus suffer no effects due to failing
      the saving throws against this effect), but most other creatures will die
      when their vitals are destroyed. This is a death effect.</p>

      <p>If the creature has a CR less than half your base attack bonus, the
      creature instead dies if they fail their first saving throw against this
      effect.</p>
