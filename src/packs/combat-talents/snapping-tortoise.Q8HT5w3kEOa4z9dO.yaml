      <p>While in this stance, whenever a creature misses an attack against a
      creature benefiting from your active defense, your next successful attack
      action against that creature before the end of your next turn forces that
      creature to succeed at a Fortitude save or fall prone even if you are no
      longer in this stance.</p>
