    value: >
      <p>When a creature fails on an attack roll or combat maneuver check
      against you, you may expend your focus to perform a bull rush, drag, or
      reposition combat maneuver against that creature as an immediate
      action.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you may expend your focus to perform a bull rush or
      reposition combat maneuver in place of an attack of opportunity. You
      cannot move as part of this attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>If this maneuver is made as a result of a creature&#8217;s movement,
      their movement ends for that round if your maneuver is successful. If this
      maneuver is successfully made as a result of a target using a spell, the
      creature must pass a concentration check equal to your combat maneuver
      check + the spell&#8217;s level or lose the spell.</p>
