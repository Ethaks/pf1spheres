      <p>Whenever you would inflict bleed damage with your blooded strike
      against a bleeding creature, instead of dealing bleed damage, you may
      choose to gain an amount of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 your base
      attack bonus, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your
      practitioner modifier. These temporary hit points stack with further uses
      of this talent, up to your base attack bonus.</p>
