    value: >
      <p>When targeted by a natural, extraordinary or supernatural ability that
      inflicts ability damage, ability drain, disease, negative levels, poison
      or any of the following conditions: (blinded, confused, cowering, dazed,
      dazzled, entangled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued, frightened,
      nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, petrified, shaken, sickened, staggered,
      stunned, unconscious) you may delay the onset of its effects until the end
      of your next turn. Each effect is treated as if it were an amount of hit
      point damage equal to the attacking creature&#8217;s Hit Dice for
      determining the capacity of your delayed damage pool. If you do not have
      enough space remaining in the delayed damage pool, you may not delay the
      effect.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (patrol) package and the Defend Other talent, when
      an ally within the area of your patrol is the target of such an ability,
      you may spend an attack of opportunity to move to put that ally within
      reach (with the normal limits for moving as part of your patrol) and
      redirect the effect to yourself.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (challenge) package, any time a creature under the
      effects of your challenge uses such an ability that does not include you
      in its effect, it suffers a -2 penalty to the ability&#8217;s save DC.
      This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 points of base attack bonus you
      possess.</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Wiki Note:</strong> Per discussion with the author, this
      is intended to permit characters to cure effects caused by things this
      ability can delay before they take effect.</sup></p>
