      <p>Whenever you take an action that is similar to a Handle Animal trick,
      the next time you handle or push your animal allies to perform that trick
      before the end of your next turn, reduce the time required to handle or
      push those animal allies by 1 step. This reduction stacks with the Rapid
      Handle talent.</p>

      <p>Whenever you handle or push an animal ally to perform a trick, that
      animal ally gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all attack rolls, skill
      checks, and ability checks made to perform that trick for a number of
      rounds equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1). For every 10 ranks
      in Handle Animal you possess, the circumstance bonus on rolls granted by
      this talent increases by +1.</p>

      <p>The action reduction and bonuses granted by Hands-On Handler do not
      stack with itself; if two handlers would grant an animal ally a bonus
      using this talent, only the highest bonus applies.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> You attack an enemy. Until the end of your
      next turn, if you would handle or push your tamed wolf to use the attack
      trick or another similar trick (such as bombard, demolish, feint, flank,
      etc.), the time required to handle or push your tamed wolf is reduced by 1
      step.</p>

      <p>GMs should determine if an action taken by a character is reasonably
      similar to tricks available through Handle Animal. Distracting a target
      with bubbles created by an Illusion effect is not similar enough to the
      attack trick.</p>
