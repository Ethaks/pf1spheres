      <p>You may recruit a troop in place of a single creature. Use the base
      statistics of a cohort, but apply the troop subtype. Your troop does one
      die of damage, increasing by one die at 3 ranks in Diplomacy and again
      every 3 ranks thereafter. This damage becomes magical when you reach 5
      ranks in Diplomacy. Once per turn, a single creature that receives this
      troop damage or the damage from a special ability granted by the
      squad&#8217;s profession may be affected as if the damage was an attack
      action for the purpose of sphere effects that apply to or modify attack
      actions. If a Leadership sphere talent would grant a cohort an attack, the
      squad may inflict its troop damage on all creatures within its reach.</p>

      <p>Unlike normal troops, a cohort troop must spend a standard action to
      inflict its troop damage. Troop damage is normally only inflicted with
      melee attacks, though some professions give special abilities that have
      range. Effects that restore hit points to a single creature may target the
      troop, but have all healing reduced to 1/4 its normal amount (minimum 1);
      if the effect targets multiple creatures, the healing is instead reduced
      to 1/2 (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>Effects that heal in an area of effect grant 1.5 times their normal
      healing. A cohort troop may be given improved gear, though any change
      requires at least 10 pieces of identical equipment.</p>

      <p>The squad gains abilities based on profession:</p>

      <p><strong>Student:</strong> 1d6 troop damage, with the bomb special
      ability.</p>

      <p><em>Bomb:</em> as a standard action, deal 1d6 + 1d6 per three levels
      acid or fire (chosen at the time of use) damage to a 10 foot radius + 5
      feet per 5 ranks in Diplomacy inside a 30 feet range +5 feet per 5 ranks
      in Diplomacy, Reflex save against your sphere DC for half.</p>

      <p><strong>Thief:</strong> 1d8 troop damage, with the low blow special
      ability.</p>

      <p><em>Low Blow:</em> Creatures that take damage from must succeed on a
      Reflex save against your sphere DC or be staggered until the end of their
      next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Warrior:</strong> 1d10 troop damage, with the batter special
      ability.</p>

      <p><em>Batter:</em> Creatures that take damage from the troop are battered
      until the end of the troop&#8217;s next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Woodsman:</strong> 1d6 troop damage, with the volley special
      ability.</p>

      <p><em>Volley:</em> as a standard action, deal 1d6 + 1d6 per three levels
      piercing damage to a 10 foot radius + 5 feet per 5 ranks in Diplomacy
      inside a 100 foot range, Reflex save against your sphere DC for half.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Healers talent, your troop cohort may restore 1d6
      hit points per two Hit Dice it possesses (minimum 1d6) to itself a number
      of times per day equal to your practitioner ability modifier with 1 minute
      worth of effort.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Messengers talent, you may dispatch up to 2
      messengers at a given time from a troop cohort.</p>
