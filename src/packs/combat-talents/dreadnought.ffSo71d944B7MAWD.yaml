      <p>You are inevitable. You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws and to your
      CMD against effects that would slow or impair your movement (such as
      entangled, grappled, paralyzed, staggered, or other similar effects),
      increasing by +1 for every 4 base attack bonus you possess. Whenever you
      would attempt a save against an effect that would slow or immobilize you,
      you may roll twice, taking the better result.</p>

      <p>In addition, once per round, you may expend martial focus as an
      immediate action to attempt a save against an effect which has slowed or
      impaired your movement, or make a combat maneuver or other appropriate
      check to escape a grapple, Lancer impale, or other similar effect.</p>
