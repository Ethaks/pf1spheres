      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 10</p>

      <p>You create a flask of pleasant thought distillate that functions as a
      splash weapon you can use as a ranged touch attack with a range increment
      of 10 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact or adjacent squares
      must attempt Will saves. Creatures who fail their saving throw have their
      disposition toward you increased by 1 step to a maximum of friendly for 1
      minute per rank in Craft (alchemy). This is a mind-affecting compulsion
      effect.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each
      time you do so, the radius increases by 5 feet. You can separately
      increase the Craft DC for this weapon by an increment of 20 to increase
      its potency; when you do so, any creature who fails its Will save against
      this effect instead have their disposition towards you increase to
      friendly for the duration.</p>
