      <p>You may spend an immediate action to redirect the damage from a
      successful attack against you to your shield. This action is taken after
      the result of the attack roll is known but before the damage is revealed.
      Attacks that do not target you directly or which do not deal hit point
      damage cannot be redirected in this manner.</p>
