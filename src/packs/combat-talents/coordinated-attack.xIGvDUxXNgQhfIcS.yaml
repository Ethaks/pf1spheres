      <p>When you use the attack action to attack, one of your animal allies may
      also attack your target with a single natural weapon it possesses as a
      joint swift action. If both you and the animal ally successfully deal
      damage with these attacks, the animal ally may immediately move 5 ft. as a
      free action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
