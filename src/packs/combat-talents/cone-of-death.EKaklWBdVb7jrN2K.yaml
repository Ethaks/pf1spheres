      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Barrage sphere, base attack bonus
      +5.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus as a full-round action to make a
      special barrage. You forgo your ability to add (blitz) talents and instead
      make a single attack against every creature within a close range (25 ft.
      +5 ft. per 2 base attack bonus) cone. Roll a single attack and apply it to
      every creature within range, dealing damage to any creature you
      successfully strike. This may affect swarms that are usually immune to
      weapon damage.</p>

      <p>You may take this talent a total of three times, up to once per 5 base
      attack bonus you possess. If taken twice, increase the size of the effect
      to a medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. per base attack bonus) range cone. If taken
      three times, increase the size of the effect to a long range (400 ft. + 40
      ft. per base attack bonus) cone.</p>

      <p>Using Cone of Death is the equivalent of making 10 attacks with ranged
      or thrown weapons; if you do not have enough ammunition or are incapable
      of reloading your weapon or drawing weapons as a free action, you cannot
      use Cone of Death. Special abilities, features, or other enhancements
      (special ammunition, enhancement bonuses, etc.) only apply to Cone of
      Death if all 10 ranged or thrown attacks would be augmented by them.</p>
