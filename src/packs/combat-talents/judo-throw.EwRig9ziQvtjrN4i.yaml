      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you may make a trip attempt as a
      standard action which does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If this
      trip attempt is successful, you may choose for the creature to land in any
      square adjacent to you.</p>

      <p>This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you cannot
      throw the creature into a space occupied by other creatures. You may
      expend your martial focus as a free action when you trip a creature with
      this talent to deal damage equal to your unarmed strike. In addition, for
      every 5 points your trip attempt exceeds the target&#8217;s CMD, you deal
      +1d10 bludgeoning damage to them. At +10 base attack bonus, you may
      instead choose for the creature to land in any square within your natural
      reach.</p>
