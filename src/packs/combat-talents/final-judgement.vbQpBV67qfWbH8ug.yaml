      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Open Hand sphere, base attack bonus
      +20.</p>

      <p>Whenever you kill a creature with an unarmed strike, that
      creature&#8217;s soul is trapped inside of your fists for up to 1 week.
      While it is inside of your fists, you can communicate with it normally and
      can influence its nature, being able to change its alignment by 1 step two
      times unless it has an alignment subtype (you could change a creature from
      chaotic evil to neutral (chaotic to neutral and evil to neutral) or
      chaotic good (evil to neutral and neutral to good)). An unwilling soul may
      attempt a Will save to resist each attempt to change its alignment. You
      can also choose to resurrect that creature with a full-round action as
      though using the Resurrection Life sphere talent, inflicting 2 temporary
      negative levels onto the creature in the process. You cannot affect the
      same creature more than once a year with this talent.</p>
