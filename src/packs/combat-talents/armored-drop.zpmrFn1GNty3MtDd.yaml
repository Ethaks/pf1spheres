      <p>While wearing medium or heavy armor, you may divert any damage taken
      from falling to your armor. Damage you redirect this way ignores your
      armor&#8217;s hardness, and you are still knocked prone if you would have
      taken fall damage without this talent. You suffer any damage in excess of
      your armor&#8217;s hit points. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong>
      Cushioning Armor</p>

      <p><strong>Addendum:</strong> You may select this talent a second time.
      When you use this talent, creatures within 5 feet of where you land suffer
      bludgeoning damage equal to half the damage that would be dealt to your
      armor. [Apoc: Armor Talents 2]</p>
