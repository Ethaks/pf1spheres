      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere, Diplomacy 1 rank.</p>

      <p>You may perform an ear-splitting scream. All targets within the area of
      effect suffer 1d8 sonic damage, +1d8 per 4 ranks in Diplomacy you possess.
      In addition, the targets become deafened for 1 round, +1 per 4 ranks in
      Diplomacy you possess. Targets are allowed a Fortitude save to halve the
      sonic damage and negate the deafened effect.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus when performing an explosive
      ululation. If you do so, all targets who fail their Fortitude save (as
      well as unattended objects) are immediately subject to a bull rush combat
      maneuver performed as a free action that does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity, using your ranks in Diplomacy + your Charisma modifier as
      your CMB. Targets are pushed directly away from you, and you cannot move
      as part of this maneuver. There is no size limitation on what creatures
      you may bull rush in this manner.</p>

      <p>You may spend a free action to warn your allies before using this
      effect protecting them from the shout&#8217;s effects, but doing so grants
      all other creatures a +5 circumstance bonus on their saving throw. This is
      a supernatural effect.</p>
