      <p>When unfolding any particle blade, you may treat it as though it was
      any other melee weapon of the same category (light, one-handed, or
      two-handed) that you are proficient with for the purpose of benefiting
      from feats, talents, or abilities. While treating the particle blade as
      another melee weapon, the particle blade also gains any special features
      that a weapon of its kind would normally gain. For example, if you were
      also proficient with the longspear, you could unfold a two-handed particle
      blade and treat it as if it were a longspear for the purposes of the
      Weapon Focus (longspear) feat, and grant the particle blade the brace and
      reach weapon specials. (See the <a href="/tech">Tech</a> sphere for more
      information on particle weapons.)</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Author's Note:</strong> If emulating a two-handed melee
      weapon with the double special property, the damage of each of the
      weapon's ends are 3 sizes smaller than normal for the particle blade
      (1d6/1d6 Medium, 1d4/1d4 Small).</sup></p>
