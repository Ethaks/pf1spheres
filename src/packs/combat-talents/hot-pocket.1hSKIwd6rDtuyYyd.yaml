      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sleight of Hand 10 ranks, Scoundrel
      sphere.</p>

      <p>When you gain this talent, designate a container in a specific location
      (such as a safe or crate in a specific warehouse). This container becomes
      your &#8220;hot pocket&#8221;. You may spend 8 hours studying a container
      to designate it as your new hot pocket. If a hot pocket is substantially
      moved, such as to another building or generally more than 30 feet, it
      stops being your hot pocket until you spend time to designate it as your
      hot pocket again. Whenever you successfully perform a steal combat
      maneuver, you may expend martial focus to teleport the stolen item to your
      hot pocket. Your hot pocket must be on the same plane as you when you
      teleport it with this effect. When you possess 15 or more ranks in Sleight
      of Hand, you may teleport objects to your hot pocket even if it is not on
      the same plane as you. This is a supernatural effect.</p>
