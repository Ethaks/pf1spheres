      <p>You gain the ability to bounce your attack off of the ceiling, floor,
      or wall to attack a protected target. You may target a 5-ft. square of a
      solid surface, then treat that spot as your new point of origin when
      attacking a target. This can allow you to attack around corners, or
      possibly ignore the cover on a target. For every 4 points of base attack
      bonus you possess, you may bounce your shot 1 additional time, but you
      suffer a -2 penalty to the attack roll per surface used to bounce in this
      fashion. A bounced surface does not take damage, and you use the total
      distance traveled (including to and between bounced surfaces) when
      determining range penalties.</p>

      <p><sup>Wiki Note: This ability has been clarified to mean that each
      bounce, including the first, imposes a cumulative -2 penalty on your
      attack roll.</sup></p>
