      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere, Vacuum Cut, base attack
      bonus +11.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use the Vacuum Cut talent, you may spend a move action and
      your martial focus to increase the effect, targeting all creatures within
      a close range cone. Make a single attack roll and compare the result to
      each creature within the affected area; all creatures hit by the attack
      take damage as though you had hit them directly with a melee attack
      (including any bonus damage to which you would be entitled, such as from
      the Vital Strike feat). Only damage is dealt; no other effects granted by
      the attack action are applied.</p>
