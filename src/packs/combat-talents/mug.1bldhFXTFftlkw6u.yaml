      <p>When you successfully perform a steal combat maneuver against a target,
      you may make a single attack against that target with any weapon you
      possess as a free action. Creatures damaged by this attack are battered
      for 1 round. You may select this talent a second time; if you do, you may
      also apply it to successful dirty tricks.</p>
