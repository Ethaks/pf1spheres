      <p>Your countless Duelist practices have built up thick scar tissue and
      callouses that provide you protection from bleeding wounds. You gain DR 2
      / bludgeoning and reduce all bleed damage you take by 1; bleed damage
      cannot be reduced below 0 by this ability. For every 5 points of base
      attack bonus you possess, the damage reduction granted by this ability
      increases by 2 points and you reduce any bleed damage you take by an
      additional 1 point.</p>
