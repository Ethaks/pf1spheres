      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere, Great Focus, base
      attack bonus +15.</p>

      <p>Whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature, you may expend two
      martial focuses to attempt to send the target to hell, or heck, or
      somewhere. If you do, that creature must succeed at a Will save or be
      transported to another plane that is strongly-aligned with evil (e.g.
      Hell, Abaddon). If the target succeeds at their saving throw, the cosmic
      energy you attempted to exploit backlashes and you suffer 6d6 fire damage
      and are fatigued. This is a supernatural effect; you can only use this
      talent against the same creature once every 24 hours.</p>
