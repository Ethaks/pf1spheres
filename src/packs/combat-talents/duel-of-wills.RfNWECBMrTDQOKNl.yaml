    value: >
      <p>Whenever you roll initiative or as a swift action, you may expend
      martial focus to target a creature within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet
      per rank in Intimidate). That creature must succeed at a Will save or take
      a -1 penalty to Armor Class and Will saves for a number of rounds equal to
      your practitioner modifier. For the duration of the penalty, the creature
      counts as demoralized for the purpose of your Gladiator talents. For every
      4 ranks in Intimidate you possess, the penalties increase by -1. This is a
      mind-affecting fear effect.</p>
