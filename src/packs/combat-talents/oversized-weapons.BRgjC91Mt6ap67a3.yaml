      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Equipment sphere, base attack bonus
      +6.</p>

      <p>You may wield weapons sized for creatures 1 size larger than yourself
      without increasing the effort required (i.e., you do not increase the
      weapon&#8217;s category by 1 step from light to one-handed, one-handed to
      two-handed, etc.), though you still suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls
      with the oversized weapon. In addition, you may treat two handed weapons
      of your normal size as one-handed weapons and may treat one-handed weapons
      of your normal size as light weapons, but suffer a -2 penalty to attack
      rolls made while doing so. These penalties are doubled when making a full
      attack action.</p>
