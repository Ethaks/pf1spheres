      <p>You may rig a technological item (including technological items,
      gadgets, inventor inventions and other such things determinable by the GM)
      that requires activation to be triggered by your snare. If the item
      requires a longer activation time than the time that would be required to
      place the trap, then the time required to place the trap increases to
      match the item activation time. If activating the item requires a skill
      check of some sort, this check must be made as part of setting the trap.
      This trap is not destroyed when triggered. Each time it is triggered, it
      consumes one charge from the item (if it is a charged item; single use
      items are counted as possessing 1 charge for this purpose), destroying the
      trap when the remaining charges reach 0.</p>

      <p>The duration of the trap also decreases by 5 rounds each time it is
      triggered. Once the trap is destroyed, any item used may be recovered,
      less any charges used. If the technological effect targets a creature, the
      triggering creature is targeted. If it targets an area, the effect
      originates from one corner of the square from which it was triggered (your
      choice). Shapes such as cones or lines must have their orientation
      determined when the trap is placed.</p>
