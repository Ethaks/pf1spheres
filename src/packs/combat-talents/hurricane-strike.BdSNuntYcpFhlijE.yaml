    value: >
      <p>Whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature in the same round that you
      draw the weapon used to deal that damage, you may make an additional
      attack against each enemy within reach as an immediate action. Make a
      single attack roll with a -2 penalty and apply it against each
      target&#8217;s AC, dealing half your normal weapon damage to each creature
      that you hit. You may instead choose to target all squares within your
      reach, removing any difficult terrain in those squares for a number of
      rounds equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1). At +10 base attack
      bonus, you instead deal your full normal weapon damage to all creatures
      hit with this talent.</p>
