      <p>By calling attention to yourself, you allow your allies to slip from
      view. Allies other than yourself within range of this boast may
      immediately make a Stealth check even if they are observed until the end
      of your next turn. You may not benefit from the Stealth skill until this
      duration expires. You may choose to activate this boast as a standard
      action without the normal requirements for activating a boast.</p>
