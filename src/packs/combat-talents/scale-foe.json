      "value": "<p>You may, as a move action, make a Climb check against the CMD of a creature within your natural reach that is at least one size larger than you to climb onto that creature, entering its space without provoking an attack of opportunity; failure on this check means that you provoke an attack of opportunity and fail to scale the creature, remaining in your current space. For every size the creature is larger than you, you gain a +3 bonus on your Climb check against that creature. You can climb with only one hand as part of using this ability, but you must have at least one hand free.</p>\n<p>While you are on a creature, you move with it whenever it moves. For every size larger that the creature is than you, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks against you. The creature is also flat-footed against your attacks. You may climb down the creature to an unoccupied adjacent square as a swift action, taking no damage, or jump off as a free action that can be taken even when it&#8217;s not your turn, taking falling damage as appropriate to the creature&#8217;s height. The creature may make a combat maneuver check against your CMD to dislodge you, causing you to fall into an adjacent square; you may substitute your Climb skill modifier + 10 in place of your CMD for this check (this includes the +3 bonus per size category). If the creature spends a full-round action to drop prone and roll, it gains a +10 bonus on this check and you take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each size category larger than you the creature is unless you choose to jump off. If you are grappled by a creature while scaling a different creature, if the scaled creature leaves the reach of the grappling creature, the grapple ends instantly. If you are subject to an effect originating from another creature that would move you while scaling an enemy and you are moved so that the scaled creature is no longer within your natural reach, this ability ends instantly.</p>\n<p>If the target creature is impaled per the impale ability of the Lancer sphere, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to CMD against grapple checks made by the target to remove you and count any hand being used to control the weapon used to impale the target as being used for the climb check. If you possess the (leap) package, you may make the required Climb check as part of any jump that would carry you through a space that would put the target within your reach. If you possess the Bronco Buster talent of the Beastmastery sphere, you may use Ride skill checks in place of Climb checks for this talent.</p>\n",
