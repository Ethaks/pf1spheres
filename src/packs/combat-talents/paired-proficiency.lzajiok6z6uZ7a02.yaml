    value: >
      <p>Each combat feat, class feature, or combat talent which would apply to
      your main hand weapon also applies to your off-hand weapon, unless it
      would be an illegal choice (such as applying a talent to a melee attack
      that only may be used with ranged attacks or applying a feat that requires
      a specific type of weapon on a weapon that does not meet these
      prerequisites).</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, combat feats, class features, or combat
      talents which would apply to your off-hand weapon also applies to your
      main hand weapon, unless they would also be an illegal choice. The only
      exception to this is special attack actions, such as brutal strikes,
      barrages, and deadly shots, which are not applied to the off-hand
      weapon.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This talent is designed to make it
      viable to use different types of weapons when dual wielding, rather than
      two copies of the same weapon. It does not allow additional actions, allow
      you to vital strike with both weapons, etc.</p>
