      <p>Whenever you successfully attack with your counter punch, all natural
      attacks the target possesses (including unarmed strikes) take a -2 penalty
      to damage rolls for 1 round. For every +4 points of base attack bonus you
      possess, penalty lasts for an additional round. At base attack bonus +10,
      this penalty increases to -5 and the target also takes a -1 penalty to
      attack rolls with natural attacks.</p>
