      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Guardian sphere, base attack bonus
      +5.</p>

      <p>At the start of their turns, hostile creatures within the area of your
      patrol must succeed on a Fortitude save or be moved 5 ft. closer to you,
      though stop when they become adjacent. This movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity. Hostile creatures within the area of your patrol
      count every square of movement directed away from you as two squares when
      determining their movement for the round. This stacks with the effects of
      difficult terrain. At +10 base attack bonus, the distance moved toward you
      and the additional cost of movement away from you increases by 5 ft. This
      is a supernatural effect.</p>
