    value: >
      <p>If you are using a shield and you are attacked by a creature you are
      aware of while not flat-footed, you may spend an attack of opportunity to
      increase your shield bonus to AC against that attack by +2. This decision
      must be made before the roll is made. For every 4 points of base attack
      bonus you possess, the increase to your shield bonus provided by this
      talent increases by 1. Talents with the (deflect) tag grant additional
      effects to this ability. Each use of active defense may only benefit from
      one (deflect) talent. You may expend your martial focus to use active
      defense in place of spending an attack of opportunity.</p>
