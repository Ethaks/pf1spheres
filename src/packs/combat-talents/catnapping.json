Often one that doesn&#8217;t belong to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sleight of Hand 5 ranks, Scoundrel sphere (Master Thief).</p>\n<p>You may perform the steal combat maneuver against a target that has another creature secured on their person (such as a familiar inside of a satchel or a creature riding atop a mount).</p>\n<p>A creature you attempt to steal this way must be at least 2 sizes smaller than you. If successful, you steal that creature. An unwilling creature stolen this way is treated as being subject to a successful grapple combat maneuver.</p>\n<p>A grapple combat maneuver performed and maintained using this talent is unique; you may perform steal combat maneuvers in place of grapple combat maneuvers to maintain this unique grapple and do not gain the grappled condition until the start of your next turn after initiating this unique grapple, allowing you to move normally and bring a grappled creature with you during your movement the same turn you steal them before continuing to grapple them normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is normally no check to hide a creature on your person; even a familiar stored away in a satchel would need to attempt checks to be hidden. For the purposes of this talent, a character may identify that there is a creature hidden on the target&#8217;s person with a Perception check (DC 10 + the target&#8217;s Sleight of Hand bonus), such as inside a satchel or coat pocket.</p>\n",
