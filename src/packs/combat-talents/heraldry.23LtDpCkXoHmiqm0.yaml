      <p>As long as you hold your clan, house, nation or party&#8217;s flag,
      members of that allegiance who can see the flag (including yourself) treat
      the effects of your tactics as though you had 5 additional ranks in
      Diplomacy. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls while
      within the area of a tactic you create. A flag must held in either one
      hand or attached to a longspear, pole, or other similar object in order to
      grant this bonus. If the standard is taken by the enemy or destroyed, the
      bonuses granted by this talent become a penalty, you treat the effects of
      your tactics as though you had 5 less ranks in Diplomacy (to a minimum of
      0), and you take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls within the area of
      tactics you create. This penalty lasts for 24 hours or until you repair
      your destroyed standard or acquire a new standard. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Flagbearer.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you have the banner class feature or other
      similar ability, you may treat your banner as your flag for the purposes
      of this talent.</p>

      <p><strong>Flag:</strong> A flag is a colorful banner that bears the
      heraldry or symbol of a nation or organization. A character with the
      Warleader (Heraldry) talent who bears a flag can grant additional combat
      bonuses to allies inside tactics they maintain. Carrying a flag in combat
      requires a free hand. <strong>Cost</strong> 10 gp <strong>Weight</strong>
      3 lbs.</p>
