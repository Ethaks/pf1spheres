    value: >
      <p>Whenever you attack a target with a weapon they did not know about (a
      hidden weapon, or an improvised weapon from the environment that
      hasn&#8217;t been wielded or used to make an attack yet), they become
      battered until the end of your next turn. Additionally, your first attack
      with that weapon gains a +1 circumstance bonus for every 4 points of base
      attack bonus you possess. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Catch-Off
      Guard.</p>
