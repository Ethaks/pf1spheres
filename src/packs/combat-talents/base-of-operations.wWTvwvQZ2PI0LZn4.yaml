      <p>Choose up to two settlements with which you are familiar when you gain
      this talent; you have a group of followers permanently based in that
      settlement that cannot be dispersed unless the settlement is destroyed, in
      which case they regroup in a nearby settlement of your choice, regaining
      10% of their strength per week. This group is in addition to your normal
      group of followers; you do not gain any additional benefit from having
      multiple groups of followers in the same location. This permanent group
      cannot form a caravan, so remains in the chosen settlement.</p>

      <p>Moving them to a new settlement requires 1d4 months of selling, buying,
      traveling, and forming new contacts. Severing ties with existing followers
      and recruiting new followers in a different settlement requires the same
      amount of time. You do not benefit from these followers during this time.
      At 5 ranks in Diplomacy and every 5 ranks thereafter, you may have your
      followers settled in an additional settlement simultaneously.</p>

      <p>Contacts from the (cohort) package will often choose to settle in a
      settlement where you maintain a presence via this talent. When you release
      a cohort and maintain them as a contact, unless they are particularly
      prone to wander or tied to a specific location, they will live in or near
      one of these locations of your choice.</p>
