      <p>While in this stance, you may treat melee attacks with improvised
      weapons as unarmed strikes for the purpose of how much damage they deal
      and interactions with abilities which require an unarmed strike.</p>

      <p>Once per turn while in this stance, you may break a weapon when
      attacking adjacent to you and spend an attack of opportunity to make an
      attack with an unarmed strike against the same target as a free
      action.</p>
