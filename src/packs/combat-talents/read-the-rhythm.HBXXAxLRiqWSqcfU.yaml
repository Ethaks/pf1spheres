    value: >
      <p>As a move action, you can select one creature within 40 ft. of
      yourself; you gain a +2 competence bonus on all opposed skill checks you
      make against that creature for 1 minute. You can only gain this bonus
      against a single creature at a time, and you can only use this talent
      against a particular creature once per day. For every 4 points of base
      attack bonus you possess, this bonus increases by +2.</p>
