    value: >
      <p>As long as you have martial focus, if you successfully use the attack
      action to strike a creature with your main-hand weapon, your off-hand
      weapon gains any enhancement bonus your mainhand weapon possesses until
      the beginning of your next turn, replacing any enhancement bonuses your
      off-hand may possess.</p>

      <p>At +10 base attack bonus, your off-hand weapon is also treated as
      though it were made of the same material as your main-hand weapon for the
      purposes of penetrating damage reduction.</p>
