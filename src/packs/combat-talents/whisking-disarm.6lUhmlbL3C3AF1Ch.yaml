    value: >
      <p>Whenever you succeed at a disarm attempt against a creature, you may
      have the disarmed weapon or object land up to 10 feet away from its
      previous wielder in a direction of your choice. The distance you may have
      the weapon or object travel before landing increases by 5 feet for every 5
      points of base attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p>In addition, creatures you succeed at a disarm attempt against gain the
      battered condition until the end of your next turn. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Greater Disarm.</p>

      <p><strong>Normal:</strong> Disarmed weapons and gear land at the feet of
      the disarmed creature.</p>
