      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Base attack bonus +4.</p>

      <p>While wearing heavy armor and fighting defensively, any adjacent
      creature that strikes you with a melee attack takes bludgeoning damage
      equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus. A creature can only take this damage
      once per round, plus one additional time each round per 5 points of base
      attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This talent was previously known as Iron
      Wall.</p>
