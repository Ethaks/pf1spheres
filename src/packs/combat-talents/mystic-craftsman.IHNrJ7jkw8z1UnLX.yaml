      <p>Your followers may craft magic items using your skill ranks, feats, and
      other abilities, even in your absence, allowing 8 hours of progress to be
      made each day in addition to any time spent by you or your allies. This
      does not increase the number of magic items that may be crafted at one
      time nor in one day. An allied PC may share his skills, feats, and
      abilities in place of yours, but all checks to craft the item take a -2
      penalty.</p>

      <p>Any allied PC crafting a magic item automatically gain a +2
      circumstance bonus to skill checks made as part of the crafting from the
      crafters&#8217; aid. This bonus increases by +1 for every 8 ranks in
      Diplomacy that you possess. If you possess the Merchant&#8217;s talent,
      treat your followers&#8217; base value as one step higher (if you have 18
      ranks or more in Diplomacy, double the base value).</p>

      <p>If you possess the (cohort) package, your cohort&#8217;s starting
      weapons count as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. If
      you also possess the Craftsmen talent, the cohort&#8217;s starting weapons
      and armor become +1 at 7 ranks in Diplomacy and +2 at 14 ranks in
      Diplomacy. This does not affect any additional weapons and armor you give
      them.</p>

      <p>If using the Downtime rules from Ultimate Campaign, your followers may
      generate Magic capital in place of earning gold, with 50 gp equaling 1
      Magic. Use your Diplomacy modifier for making the earnings checks. This
      stacks with capital gains from other talents.</p>
