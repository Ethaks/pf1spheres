      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brute sphere, Muscular Surge.</p>

      <p>You may use your Muscular Surge talent as a free action rather than a
      move action, and are not fatigued after its duration expires; in essence,
      the bonuses become permanent. Your total carrying capacity is also
      multiplied by 2. This does not stack with other effects that multiply
      carrying capacity, such as the ant haul spell.</p>

      <p>You may still expend your martial focus as a free action to gain the
      more powerful bonus for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution
      modifier, and are only fatigued afterward rather than exhausted. For this
      duration, you also count as being one size larger than you are for the
      purpose of targeting creatures with combat maneuvers and for talents that
      have effects dependent on size, such as Rock Toss or Thrower&#8217;s
      Reflexes from the Equipment sphere, the Terrain Trasher legendary Brute
      talent, or Living Weapon from the Wrestling sphere.</p>
