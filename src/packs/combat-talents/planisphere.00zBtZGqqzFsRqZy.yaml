      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (followers) package,
      Air Travel, Teleportation, Diplomacy 15 ranks.</p>

      <p>Your followers are equipped for planar travel. While with your caravan,
      you and a number of allies equal to your Diplomacy modifier may ignore
      negative planar traits.</p>

      <p>Your caravan can meet you in any location on any plane within 1d4 days.
      This does not grant the caravan the ability to travel into dangerous
      places, though the effects of dangerous planes are ignored when
      determining where they can travel. Once per day, you and your allies can
      be carried to another plane by your caravan, arriving between 5 and 500
      miles from a chosen destination. This requires 1d4 hours.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Messengers talent, your messengers can reach any
      location on any plane and return within 1d4 days. If you possess both
      Messengers and Merchants, your messengers can be sent to obtain items from
      anywhere in the planes. You do not need to roll for availability; if it is
      available for purchase anywhere in the planes it will be bought and
      brought to you.</p>
