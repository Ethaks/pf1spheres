    value: >
      <p>As long as you have the drunk status when you make a Bluff or Diplomacy
      check, you gain a +1 competence bonus on it. This bonus increases by +1
      for every 5 base attack bonus you have. You may also expend your drunk
      status as a free action to reroll a Bluff or Diplomacy check, but you must
      take the new result, even if it is worse. If you do so, you take a -5 on
      Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the next 10 minutes.</p>
