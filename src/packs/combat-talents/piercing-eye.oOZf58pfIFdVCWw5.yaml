    value: >
      <p>You have learned to see through obscuring effects and to spot the
      subtle patterns in defensive illusions. You may spend a move action to
      reduce your miss chance due to concealment on a single creature by 5%
      until the start of your next turn (this cannot reduce your miss chance due
      to concealment below 0).</p>

      <p>For every 2 ranks in Stealth you possess, you further reduce your miss
      chance due to concealment by an additional 5%. You may expend your focus
      to make this a free action. If the target is under the effects of the
      mirror image spell or a similar effect, you may roll twice and choose the
      most favorable result when determining if the target was struck.</p>
