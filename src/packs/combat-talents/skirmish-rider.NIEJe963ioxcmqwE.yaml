      <p>While mounted and moving with your mount, you and your mount may each
      make an attack action at any point during the movement and then complete
      the movement. This requires using your standard action as normal and
      cannot be used if you do not have a standard action available. You and
      your mount do not provoke attacks of opportunity from one creature of your
      choice that you make an attack or combat maneuver roll against as part of
      this attack action.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you may make an attack action at any point when you make
      a joint withdraw action while mounted. If you possess the Athletics
      sphere, you cannot regain focus on the same withdraw action as you use
      this option.</p>
