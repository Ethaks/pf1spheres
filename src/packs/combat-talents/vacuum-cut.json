      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Duelist sphere.</p>\n<p>Whenever you use the attack action to make a melee attack in the same round you draw a sheathed weapon, you may target a creature within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 base attack bonus), provoking attacks of opportunity as though using a ranged attack.</p>\n<p>Using this talent reduces the damage die of the weapon being used with this talent by 1 step, and the attack made with this weapon is treated as a projectile for the purposes of being able to be blocked or deflected by effects. This attack is treated as a melee attack for all other purposes (and may not be used with talents or abilities which would only affect ranged attacks) except for the target of the attack. At +5 base attack bonus, using this talent no longer provokes attacks of opportunity. At +10 base attack bonus, attacks made with this talent no longer have their damage die reduced.</p>\n<p>You may take Vacuum Cut a second time. If you do, when utilizing another Duelist sphere talent that targets creatures within your reach (such as Iai Slash and Hurricane Strike, but not talents that merely grant you an attack such as Swift Slice), you may instead use the range of Vacuum Cut in place of your reach for the purpose of those talents.</p>\n",
