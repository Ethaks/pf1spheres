      "value": "<p>You create a single use bag of fine metallic powder you can throw as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet that drastically deteriorates the defenses&#8212;both manufactured and natural&#8212;of those affected. Anyone standing on the square of impact or in adjacent squares must attempt a Fortitude save; targets 10 feet away must also succeed a Fortitude save but gain a +5 circumstance bonus. Creatures who are immune to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (such as constructs and undead) are not immune to the effects of this formulae.</p>\n<p>Creatures that fail the save have a specific form of damage reduction reduced by 2 + 1 per 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy) for 1 minute, or until they wash the powder off (which ends the effect). While a creature may have multiple types of damage resistance reduced with different blanch bombs, multiple applications of this formulae (even from multiple sources) to reduce a specific type of damage reduction do not stack, only the most potent applies. You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; each time you do so, the area of effect increases by 5 ft., and all saving throw DCs increase by +2.</p>\n<p>The types of damage reduction that may be reduced are determined by the Craft DC used for its creation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DC 20:</strong> damage reduction/magic</li>\n<li><strong>DC 25:</strong> damage reduction/cold iron or damage reduction/silver (chosen at the time of creation)</li>\n<li><strong>DC 30:</strong> damage reduction/adamantine</li>\n<li><strong>DC 35:</strong> damage reduction/alignment-based (chosen at the time of creation)</li>\n</ul>\n",
