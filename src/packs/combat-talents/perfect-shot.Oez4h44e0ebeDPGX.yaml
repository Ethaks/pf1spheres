      <p>As long as you have martial focus, whenever you would suffer a miss
      chance due to concealment, roll the miss chance twice and take the most
      favorable result. In addition, as long as you have martial focus, you no
      longer automatically miss when rolling a natural 1 on a ranged attack
      roll; your attack must still hit the target&#8217;s AC as normal. At +10
      base attack bonus, you can reroll a result of 1 on a ranged attack roll
      once per round.</p>
