      <p>While in this stance, whenever you successfully damage a creature with
      an attack action or attack of opportunity, you may choose to extend the
      duration of one of your active warleader abilities. If you choose an
      active shout, increase the duration by 1 round. If you choose an active
      tactic, the next time you maintain that tactic you may do so as a free
      action which allows you to recenter the tactic as normal. You can only
      extend the duration of an individual shout or tactic once per round with
      this talent.</p>
