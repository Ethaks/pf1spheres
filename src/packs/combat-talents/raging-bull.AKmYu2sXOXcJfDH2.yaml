    value: >
      <p>Whenever you ready a counter punch, you can instead ready a charge,
      although you may only move up to your speed with this charge (the attack
      granted by this charge is still treated as an attack action).
      <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Rhino Charge.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> Abilities that multiply damage dealt on
      a charge, such as the Spirited Charge feat or wielding a lance while
      making a mounted charge, may not be used with this talent.</p>
