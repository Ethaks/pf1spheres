      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Stealth 3 ranks or Perception 3 ranks;
      Scout sphere.</p>

      <p>Whenever a scouted target attacks you or includes you in an area of
      effect which deals hit point damage, as an immediate action, you may
      attempt a Stealth or Perception check with a DC equal to the scouted
      target&#8217;s attack roll or the ability&#8217;s saving throw DC. If your
      check is successful, you only suffer 1/2 the hit point damage dealt by the
      incoming attack and do not suffer any additional effects dealt by that
      attack (such as an additional saving throw against a negative
      condition).</p>

      <p>You may use this ability after the results of the attack roll are
      revealed or after you roll a saving throw to avoid or resist the area of
      effect.</p>

      <p>You may only use this ability once per day for each scouted target.</p>
