      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere, Craft (alchemy) 10
      ranks.</p>

      <p>You may choose for your poison to make the creature staggered instead
      of fatigued. Creatures who fail two consecutive saving throws against this
      poison are instead immobilized and cannot move from the location they were
      in when they failed their saving throw, and creatures who fail three
      consecutive saving throws become petrified. A petrified character has been
      turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character
      cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he
      returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character&#8217;s petrified body
      is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete
      and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or
      debilitation.</p>
