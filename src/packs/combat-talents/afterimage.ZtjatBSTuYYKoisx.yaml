      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere.</p>

      <p>When moving more than 5 ft. during your turn using the movement mode
      corresponding to a package you possess, the speed of your motion causes
      you to leave behind an afterimage, which may foil your foe&#8217;s
      attacks. If you move more than 20 ft., you may expend your martial focus
      as a free action to leave behind an additional afterimage. These
      afterimages disappear at the start of your next turn. For every 6 ranks in
      Acrobatics you possess, you may leave an additional afterimage.</p>

      <p>Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an
      attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your
      afterimages instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether
      the selected target is real or an afterimage.</p>

      <p>If it is an afterimage, the afterimage is destroyed. If the attack
      misses by 5 or less, one of your afterimages is destroyed by the near
      miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your
      afterimages. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect
      you normally and do not destroy any of your afterimages. Spells that
      require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy an
      afterimage.</p>

      <p>An attacker must be able to see the afterimages to be fooled. If you
      are invisible or the attacker is blind, this ability has no effect
      (although the normal miss chances still apply).</p>
