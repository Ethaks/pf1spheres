      <p>While within the affected area of this tactic, allied creatures are
      considered to be flanking as long as they both threaten the same creature,
      regardless of their comparative positioning.</p>

      <h2 id="toc2"><span><span style="color: #993300">Shouts</span></span></h2>

      <p>Shouts are sound-based effects centered on the practitioner that affect
      creatures in an area of effect centered on the practitioner with a radius
      of 10 ft. + 5 ft. per 2 ranks in Diplomacy the practitioner possesses. The
      practitioner may choose whether or not to include himself in the effects
      of his shout. The effects of shouts last for a number of rounds equal to 1
      + 1 for every 4 ranks in Diplomacy you possesses, and use your ranks in
      Diplomacy instead of your base attack bonus when determining any saving
      throws. Unless otherwise noted, using a shout is a standard action. Deaf
      characters or characters otherwise lacking the ability to hear gain a +5
      bonus on all saves against shout effects, and must attempt a saving throw
      against a shout even if its effects would be beneficial. Practitioners in
      the area of a silence spell or otherwise unable to make a sound cannot use
      shouts until they are once more able to be heard.</p>

      <p>While some shouts only affect allies or enemies, others affect all
      targets within their area of effect. When performing such a shout, you may
      spend a move action to warn your allies to cover their ears and negate the
      effects, but doing so gives enemies within the area of effect a +5 bonus
      to their saving throw against the shout&#8217;s effects. Some shouts may
      require you to expend your martial focus, as described in their entry.</p>

      <p>When you first gain the Warleader sphere, you gain the following
      shout:</p>
