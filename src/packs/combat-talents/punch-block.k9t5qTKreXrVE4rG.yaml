    value: >
      <p>When you use your active defense, you may choose to make an attack roll
      as if making a shield bash and must use the result of this attack in place
      of your AC for resolving the attack, even if lower. You must be capable of
      making shield bash attacks with the shield to use this ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Punch Block replaces your entire AC bonus with
      your attack roll; treat this as though using your active defense. This is
      not a shield bonus, and does not apply to attacks which would bypass your
      Shield bonus (such as the Improved Precise Shot feat). The Deflecting
      Shield talent does not allow Punch Block to apply against touch
      attacks.</p>
