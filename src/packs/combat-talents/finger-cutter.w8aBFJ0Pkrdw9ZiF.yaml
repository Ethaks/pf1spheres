      <p>Whenever you succeed at a disarm attempt against a creature, they take
      1 additional point of bleed damage, +1 additional point for every 3 points
      of base attack bonus you possess. This stacks with other bleed damage
      granted by the Duelist sphere.</p>

      <p>In addition, you no longer provoke attacks of opportunity for
      attempting the disarm combat maneuver. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong>
      Improved Disarm.</p>
