      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (cohort) package, Diplomacy 5 ranks.</p>\n<p>You can seek out powerful individuals to serve you, for a price. The time required to find and negotiate with a given creature will vary depending on the creature&#8217;s location, whether you are looking for a specific individual, and other factors, meaning that the time is determined by the GM. Normal rates are 10 gp per Hit Die per day for traveling or non-hazardous tasks, while dangerous tasks, such as aiding you in combat or accompanying you into hazardous locations, this price can increase to 100 to 1,000 gp per Hit Die per day. Creatures so hired count as cohorts for activating and benefiting from (cohort) talents. Creatures hired with this ability do not count against the number of Hit Dice of cohorts you may have recruited at one time.</p>\n<p>Payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to a quest on your part that matches the creature&#8217;s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. Creatures with no racial Hit Dice and only NPC class levels usually can be hired for half of the price of others.</p>\n<p>Few, if any, creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal. However, at the GM&#8217;s discretion, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature&#8217;s ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.</p>\n",
