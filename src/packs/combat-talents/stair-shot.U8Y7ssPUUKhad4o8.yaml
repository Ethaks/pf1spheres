      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Barrage sphere.</p>

      <p>As an attack action, you may expend 10 pieces of ammunition from a
      ranged weapon to create a staircase of arrows/bolts. There must be a wall,
      cliff, or another suitable mostly-vertical surface for you to use when
      creating a staircase of arrows, and the staircase cannot extend more than
      5 ft. per point of base attack bonus you possess, but you may choose its
      shape (going straight across, or up or down as desired, but no steeper
      than 45 degrees either direction). You may expend your martial focus to
      perform this maneuver as an immediate action, such as to build a platform
      to stop someone from falling.</p>

      <p>This only functions with weapons that fire arrows, bolts, or other
      appropriate ammunition, and that you may reload as a free action.</p>
