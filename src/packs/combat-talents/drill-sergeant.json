You may grant a cohort creature 1 bonus Hit Die for every hour you spend training it with a Diplomacy check with a DC of 10 + the creature&#8217;s new Hit Dice total.</p>\n<p>These additional Hit Dice count against your Hit Dice cap for the recruit ability as normal and cannot cause the creature&#8217;s Hit Dice to exceed the maximum shown on Table: Cohort. If a cohort is released, these bonus Hit Dice are lost at a rate of 1 per week. Additional feats and skill points from these Hit Dice are assigned by you.</p>\n<p>You may retrain feats and skill ranks possessed by cohort. You may retrain one feat, talent, or a number of skill ranks equal to your ranks in Diplomacy with 4 hours of training. The new feats and skills must be appropriate for the cohort; cohorts may not gain casting abilities. The GM is the final arbiter of what feats and skills are suitable. With 8 hours of training, you may instead retrain a number of feats equal to half your ranks in Diplomacy (minimum 2 feats).</p>\n<p>You may recruit 1 Hit Die cohorts from your followers. You may recruit a number of cohorts not exceeding your practitioner ability modifier (minimum 1) this way each week.</p>\n",
