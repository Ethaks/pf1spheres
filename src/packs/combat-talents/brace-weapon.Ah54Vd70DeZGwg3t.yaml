      <p>You may use a shield or a weapon held in two hands to perform an
      overrun maneuver. If using a shield, you may add the shield&#8217;s AC
      bonus to your CMB. If using a weapon held in two hands, you may add the
      weapon&#8217;s enhancement bonus, as well as bonuses to attack from spells
      or feats such as Weapon Focus, to your CMB. You may choose to use a shield
      bash as your weapon for this purpose, in which case the shield&#8217;s
      attack bonus, rather than its AC bonus, is used.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may use one of the above to perform a shove, adding
      their bonuses to your shove&#8217;s attack roll. If using a weapon in this
      fashion, you may also add its enhancement bonus to your shove&#8217;s
      damage, as well as damage from appropriate special abilities such as
      flaming, holy, etc.</p>
