      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere, Diplomacy 15
      ranks.</p>

      <p>You may expend your focus to perform a shout that saps the very life
      and will to live from a creature. Any creature within this shout&#8217;s
      radius who fails a Fortitude saving throw suffers 1d4 temporary negative
      levels that lasts 1 day. You may spend a move action to warn your allies
      before using this effect protecting them from the shout&#8217;s effects,
      but doing so grants all other creatures a +5 circumstance bonus on their
      saving throw. This is a supernatural effect.</p>
