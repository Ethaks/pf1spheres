      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere, Sleight of Hand 9
      ranks.</p>

      <p>When performing a steal combat maneuver, rather than steal an item, you
      may attempt to transfer an ongoing spell effect from that target to
      yourself for 1 round per rank in Sleight of Hand you possess. At the end
      of this duration, the effect ends on yourself and returns to the creature
      it was stolen from. Time spent stolen still counts against the
      effect&#8217;s duration, and if the effect&#8217;s duration expires while
      it is stolen, it ends as normal. At 10 ranks in Sleight of Hand, the
      duration increases to 1 minute per rank you possess.</p>

      <p>This functions with spell effects with a target of &#8216;self&#8217;,
      but does not otherwise function with spell effects that would consider you
      an invalid target (for example, if the effect only targets specific
      creature types). This is a supernatural effect.</p>
