    value: >
      <p>When making an attack action, attack of opportunity, or additional
      attack granted by a class feature or talent with an unarmed strike, you
      may add 1.5x your Strength bonus on the damage roll rather than just your
      Strength bonus (this talent does not apply to off-hand attacks or other
      attacks where a half Strength modifier is specified). On attacks targeting
      prone creatures, you instead deal 2x your Strength modifier on the damage
      roll for your unarmed strikes.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This only applies to attacks where you
      use your Strength modifier. Axe Kick does not work if you use a different
      ability modifier for damage.</p>
