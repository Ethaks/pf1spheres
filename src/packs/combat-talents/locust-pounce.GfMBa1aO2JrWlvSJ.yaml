      <p>You may roll an Acrobatics check to jump as part of a melee attack
      action, moving no more than half your land speed before performing the
      attack action. This movement is not subtracted from your total movement
      per round. You may expend your martial focus to make this movement without
      provoking an attack of opportunity.</p>
