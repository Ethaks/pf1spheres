      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere, base attack bonus +10.</p>\n<p>Whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature who is already taking bleed damage, you are able to twist your blade to puncture a lung or similar organ, causing the target to begin suffocating 1d4 rounds later unless they succeed on a Fortitude save. Once the suffocation begins, in the first round, the target falls unconscious (0 hit points). In the following round, they drop to &#8211;1 hit points and are dying. In the third round, they suffocate and die. The target may make a Fortitude save each round to stave off advancing to the next stage, but they continue to make saving throws each round until they die or until the condition ends.</p>\n<p>If the target receives at least 5 hit points of healing at any point before they suffocate, the suffocation effect ends and they resume breathing as normal. The suffocation effect can also be ended as a full-round action by a Heal check with a DC equal to your normal DC for combat sphere effects. Creatures who do not need to breathe are immune to this effect. If a practitioner uses Bleed Air against a creature that is currently suffocating, they are automatically moved 1 round closer to suffocation.</p>\n",
