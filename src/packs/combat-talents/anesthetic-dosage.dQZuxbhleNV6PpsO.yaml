      <p>Instead of causing fatigue, your poison makes the target numb (this
      talent cannot be used with a contact or inhaled poison). Those who are
      under the effects of this poison can convert the next 2 hit points of
      lethal damage they take to nonlethal damage; this effect last for 1 minute
      or until expended. For every rank in Craft (alchemy) you possess, the
      creature can convert an additional 2 hit points of lethal damage into
      nonlethal damage. The creature also gains a +2 circumstance bonus against
      spells and abilities with the (pain) descriptor, +1 for every 4 ranks in
      Craft (alchemy) you possess. A creature cannot benefit from an Anesthetic
      Dosage more than once per hour.</p>
