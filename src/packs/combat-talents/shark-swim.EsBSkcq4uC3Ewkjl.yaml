      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere.</p>

      <p>While swimming, you move at your full base speed as a move action
      rather than half speed, or double your base speed as a full-round action.
      You may perform the run action while swimming, may take 10 on Swim checks
      even when threatened or endangered, and do not need to make swim checks
      each hour to avoid taking damage from fatigue. Making standard or
      full-round actions no longer reduces how long you can hold your
      breath.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Strong Lungs talent, you can replace its usual bonus
      to holding breath and instead hold your breath for a number of hours equal
      to your Constitution modifier.</p>
