    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully attack a creature with a charge, you may roll
      an Acrobatics check against the CMD of the creature as a free action,
      adding the attack bonus from charging to your roll. If you succeed, you
      may continue your charge&#8217;s movement any distance as long as you
      still have movement remaining. This movement does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity from the attacked creature nor is it halved for moving through
      squares threatened or occupied by the attacked creature. If you fail this
      check, you instead provoke an attack of opportunity from the attacked
      creature and not move further.</p>
