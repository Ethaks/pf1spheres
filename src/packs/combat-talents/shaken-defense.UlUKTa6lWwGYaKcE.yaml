      <p>Whenever you successfully demoralize a creature, it takes an additional
      -2 penalty to its combat maneuver rolls and CMD for the duration of the
      demoralization. In addition, if they attempt a combat maneuver against
      you, it always provokes an attack of opportunity, even if it normally
      would not. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this penalty is
      doubled.</p>
