      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sniper sphere, Perfect Shot, base
      attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>As a full-round action, you may perform a deadly shot with a -5 penalty
      that increases your weapon&#8217;s base range increment to 1 mile. You can
      attack a target without having line of sight or line of effect to them,
      ignoring any cover or concealment they possess, provided there is at least
      some form of straight open path between you and them, even if that path
      must go over a mountain or some other sort of large obstacle. However, you
      must have an accurate idea of the target&#8217;s location, such as by
      being signaled by a flying ally or informed of the target&#8217;s location
      and movements via a spell cast by an ally who currently has line of sight
      to the opponent. Creatures who are completely enclosed by protective
      surfaces, such as creatures inside a castle room with no windows, cannot
      be targeted by this effect.</p>
