      <p>You confuse enemies with flirtatious gestures before your attack. The
      next enemy you attack before the end of your next turn must succeed at a
      Will save, or else they are denied their Dexterity bonus to AC against
      your attack. Each time the same creature attempts a save against this
      effect they gain a cumulative +1 bonus to the save for the next 24
      hours.</p>
