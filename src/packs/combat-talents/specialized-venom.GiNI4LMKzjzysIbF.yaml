    value: >
      <p>You select 1 creature type (or subtype) from the ranger favored enemy
      list; your poisons may affect creatures of that type even if they would
      normally be immune to poison (or ignore any racial bonuses they may
      possess to saving throws against poison). For every 4 ranks in Craft
      (alchemy) you possess, you may select another creature type (or
      subtype).</p>

      <p><sup><strong>Clarification:</strong> This is intended to work on
      creature types that are normally immune to poison, such as constructs.
      That includes allowing Specialized Venoms to bypass constructs' immunity
      to effects requiring Fortitude saves on top of their immunity to poisons.
      This does not inherently bypass other immunities, such as immunity to
      fatigue.</sup></p>
