      <p>While in this stance, whenever a creature within reach misses you with
      a melee attack, you may expend an attack of opportunity to perform a dirty
      trick or steal maneuver against that creature as a free action that can be
      taken outside of your normal turn. You may not use this talent in
      conjunction with (deflect) talents or any other ability that would grant
      you an attack or combat maneuver due to a missed attack against you.</p>
