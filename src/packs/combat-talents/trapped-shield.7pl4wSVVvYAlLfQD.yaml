      <p>You may place Trap sphere dart traps onto any shield (except a buckler)
      you&#8217;re wielding using a normal placement action. Whenever you are
      missed by a melee attack, you may trigger the trap as an immediate action,
      making the trap&#8217;s attack against the attacking creature. If you

      ability.</p>
