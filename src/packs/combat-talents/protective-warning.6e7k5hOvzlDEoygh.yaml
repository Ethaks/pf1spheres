      <p>You can warn your allies to protect themselves better against an
      enemy&#8217;s specific attack. When you use this shout, choose one
      specific ability you know an enemy possesses (such as a dragon&#8217;s
      breath weapon, a practitioner ogre&#8217;s brutal strike (exertion), or a
      specific spell or magical sphere effect an enemy uses, but not all
      spellcasting). All allies in the radius of this shout gain a +2 competence
      bonus to saving throws against that specific ability, increasing by +1 for
      every 5 ranks in Diplomacy you possess. You may expend martial focus to
      use this shout as an immediate action, but the bonuses from this shout end
      after one round.</p>

      <p>You must know about the ability to warn against it, such as having
      succeeded a Knowledge check and learned about that ability, witnessing the
      ability from the enemy, or learning about the ability from another source
      (such as an ally informing you).</p>

      <p>For spherecasting effects, which can be highly mutable, the bonus from
      this shout applies to the base ability used rather than an exact
      combination of talents. For example, this shout can be used in reaction to
      a destructive blast, and would apply to an unmodified Destruction
      sphere&#8217;s destructive blast or a destructive blast modified by the
      Energy Strike or Chain Blast talents.</p>
