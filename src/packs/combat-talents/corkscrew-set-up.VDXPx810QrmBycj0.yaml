      <p>As a part of readying an action to perform a counter punch, you can
      make an attack roll against one creature within your reach. If this attack
      hits, it deals no damage, but until the start of your next turn, the
      target of this attack can move only in such a way that the space it
      occupies is adjacent to you after their movement. Alternatively, it can
      attempt a combat maneuver check (against your CMD) on their turn as a
      swift action to ignore this talent&#8217;s effect. If your base attack
      bonus is +10 or higher, this attack deals damage equal to your
      practitioner modifier + your base attack bonus instead of no damage.</p>
