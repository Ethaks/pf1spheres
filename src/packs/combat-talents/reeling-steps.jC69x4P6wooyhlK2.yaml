      <p>Until the beginning of your next turn, any movement you make or combat
      maneuvers you attempt do not provoke attacks of opportunity; you also gain
      an alchemical bonus on Perform (dance) checks equal to 1/2 your base
      attack bonus as long as you have the drunk status. At +10 base attack
      bonus, creatures cannot apply their Dexterity bonus to their CMD against
      combat maneuvers you attempt while using this talent and you can expend
      your drunk status to treat a Perform (dance) check as though you rolled a
      15.</p>
