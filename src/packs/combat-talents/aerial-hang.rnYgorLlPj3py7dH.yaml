      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Athletics sphere.</p>

      <p>While in this stance and standing on solid ground, you may levitate 5
      feet off of the ground until the beginning of your next turn as a free
      action. While levitating this way, you gain a +2 to your CMD against
      creatures at a lower elevation. In addition, whenever you successfully
      attack a creature with a melee attack action while levitating this way,
      you can make a free 5-foot step. At the beginning of your next turn, you
      descend back to the ground, although you can instantly kick off of the
      ground to return to your previous space if this stance is still active
      (this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity); if you are not 5
      feet above solid ground, you fall as normal. For every 5 ranks in
      Acrobatics you possess, the bonus to your CMD increases by 1 and you can
      levitate an additional 5 feet from the ground (and can be an additional 5
      feet from the ground before treated as though you were falling).</p>
