      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fencing sphere, Parry and Riposte, base
      attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>You may use your Parry and Riposte talent against ranged attacks and
      spells which require attack rolls as well as melee attacks. You still
      cannot make a retaliatory attack against the target unless it is within
      your reach. In addition, you may use Parry and Riposte in place of making
      a Reflex save against a spell, supernatural, or extraordinary ability you
      are aware of. If you succeed on this check, the effect is reduced as if
      you had the evasion rogue class feature.</p>
