    value: >
      <p>Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a
      ranged weapon, you may instead expend your martial focus and choose to
      catch the weapon. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed, and
      you must have at least one hand free. Attempting to catch a ranged attack
      doesn&#8217;t count as an action. You cannot catch an attack that is from
      a weapon sized for a creature more than one size category larger than you
      are. Ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects
      can&#8217;t be caught. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Snatch
      Arrows.</p>
