      <p>Whenever you use the attack action to attack while wielding two
      weapons, you can expend your martial focus as a swift action to deal
      additional damage with all attacks you make equal to the weapon damage die
      of your offhand weapon (if you possess multiple offhand weapons, you must
      select 1 to use with this talent) until the end of your turn. This bonus
      damage is not increased by the Vital Strike feat or critical hits.</p>
