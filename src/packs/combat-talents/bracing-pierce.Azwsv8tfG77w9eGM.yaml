    value: >
      <p>Whenever you ready an action to intercept a charge, you can also impale
      the charging creature without taking a -2 on the attack roll; readying an
      action in this fashion does not alter your place in the initiative order.
      Once per round while you have an action readied in this fashion, you may
      move up to half your base speed as a free action even when it is not your
      turn; if this movement would place you in the path of a charging creature,
      you can make your readied attack against them. At +10 base attack bonus,
      if a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from you due to moving
      towards you, they are treated as a charging creature for the purpose of
      triggering your readied action.</p>
