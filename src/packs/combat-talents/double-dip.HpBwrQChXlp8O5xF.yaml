    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver, you
      may expend your martial focus as a free action to select two different
      conditions to apply to a creature instead of just one, although both
      conditions may be removed with the same action. When you have at least 10
      ranks in Sleight of Hand, you can instead apply up to three conditions.
      You cannot use this talent to apply conditions that could not normally be
      applied by a dirty trick (such as with the savage dirty trick rage
      power).</p>
