      <p>If you possess the brutal breaker ability, you may treat an improvised
      weapon as having the fragile weapon special feature regardless of its
      hardness or material for the purposes of feats or other talents you
      possess. In addition, you can break an improvised weapon regardless of its
      hardness of material. This ability does not allow you to break magic items
      or creatures being used as improvised weapons.</p>

      <p>In addition, whenever you use a (smash) talent as part of a given
      action, you may expend your martial focus to use a second (smash) talent,
      provided that (smash) talent can apply to that action.</p>
