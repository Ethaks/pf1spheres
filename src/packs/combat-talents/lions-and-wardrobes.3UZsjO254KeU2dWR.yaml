      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Disguise 1 rank, Beastmastery sphere
      ((handle animal) package).</p>

      <p>You may use Handle Animal to teach an animal a unique trick:</p>

      <p><strong>Civilized (DC 20):</strong> The companion can commingle with
      humanoid society, and is able to behave autonomously and appropriately in
      complex social situations, such as bowing to a monarch when appropriate,
      attending a dinner party, or generally behaving like a polite person in
      any given scenario. This is not intelligence, it is simply learned
      mannerisms that conveniently allow an animal to react to both simple and
      complex social situations, and react appropriately to questions and
      conversations as though it understood languages the handler possessed at
      the time they taught the animal this trick.</p>

      <p>In addition, when attempting a Disguise check to alter an
      animal&#8217;s appearance, the Disguise check takes no penalties due to
      different gender, race, age, or size category. Disguising an animal in
      this way may be as simple as putting a hat on a bear to applying full
      makeup and costumery to a salamander. An animal disguised this way does
      not automatically draw attention to itself, though it may draw suspicion
      if it does not behave appropriately to a situation. You may substitute
      your Handle Animal bonus in place of your Disguise bonus when attempting
      this check.</p>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> A bear disguised as a human noble and taught
      the Civilized trick could attend a nobleman&#8217;s dinner party, not draw
      suspicion to itself while disguised as a noble, and even engage in basic
      social etiquette.</p>
