      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere, Craft (alchemy) 10
      ranks.</p>

      <p>Whenever a creature fails their Fortitude saving throw against this
      poison, they gain 1 temporary negative level that lasts for 24 hours,
      making another save at that time or the negative level becomes permanent.
      Additionally, if they fail their saving throw against this poison, they
      must pass another Fortitude save at the beginning of their next turn or
      gain another temporary negative level and need to save the following round
      or gain another. If a creature dies due to the effect of this poison, they
      rise 1 minute later as a zombie. This talent is a death effect.</p>
