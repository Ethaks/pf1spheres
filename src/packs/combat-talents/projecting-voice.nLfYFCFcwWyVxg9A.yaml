      <p>When using a shout, you may center your shout inside any square of an
      ongoing tactic you are maintaining, treating that square as the point of
      origin for that shout. If you have Breath Support or another talent or
      effect which would allow you to change the shape of your shout (such as
      into a line or cone), you choose the direction of your shout as normal
      from that square.</p>
