      <p>You may expend your martial focus to use this shout, allowing all
      allies within its radius to make a new saving throw against any ongoing
      effect they are currently suffering from that normally grants a saving
      throw using the original DC, even if they have already failed the initial
      save and would not normally be granted another. Poison and disease effects
      that can worsen on a failed saving throw do not count this saving throw as
      a failure when determining such effects if it is unsuccessful. A creature
      can only benefit from this shout once in regard to any individual
      effect.</p>
