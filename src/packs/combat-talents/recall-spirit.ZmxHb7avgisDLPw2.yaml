      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere, Rousing Claxon,
      Diplomacy 10 ranks.</p>

      <p>You may expend your focus to recall the spirit of a creature within
      range of your shout that has died within 1 round. The target is healed for
      an amount equal to your ranks in Diplomacy + your Charisma modifier. If
      this healing is enough to raise the slain creature&#8217;s hit points to
      an amount greater than its Constitution score in negative hit points, it
      is returned to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. If the
      creature&#8217;s hit point total would still be at a negative amount
      greater than or equal to its Constitution score, it remains dead.
      Creatures brought back to life via this ability gain a temporary negative
      level that lasts for one day. This is a supernatural effect.</p>
