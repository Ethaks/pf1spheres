    value: >
      <p>As an immediate action, when a creature targets you with a melee
      attack, before the attack roll is made you may allow the attack to
      automatically strike you (although the roll is still made to determine if
      the attack threatens a critical hit). After the damage is determined, you
      may make a brutal strike targeting that creature as a free action that may
      be taken even when it isn&#8217;t your turn, if it is in range. If the
      creature attacking you is battered, you may resolve your attack action
      prior to their attack being resolved.</p>
