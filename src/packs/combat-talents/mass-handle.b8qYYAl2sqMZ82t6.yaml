      <p>You may increase the action required to handle or push an animal ally
      by one step to affect 1 additional animal ally creature plus 1 additional
      animal ally for every 2 ranks in Handle Animal you possess. You may expend
      martial focus instead of increasing the action required.</p>

      <p>When handling or pushing multiple animal allies with this talent,
      determine the action required based on the longest action required. When
      handling or pushing multiple animal allies, each animal ally can be
      commanded to perform a different trick (such as a wolf being told to guard
      and an eagle being told to attack).</p>
