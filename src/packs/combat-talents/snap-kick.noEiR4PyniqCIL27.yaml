      <p>Whenever you succeed on a trip combat maneuver against a creature, they
      provoke an attack of opportunity from you (you can choose to wait until
      the creature is prone before resolving this attack of opportunity), this
      attack of opportunity considers &#8220;whenever a creature lands
      prone&#8221; and &#8220;whenever you succeed on a trip combat
      maneuver&#8221; to be part of the same trigger, and you can not take more
      than one attack of opportunity due to this circumstance. If your attack of
      opportunity is successful, the creature must make a successful Reflex save
      or become staggered until the end of their next turn.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> This attack of opportunity from this ability
      must be made as an unarmed strike.</p>
