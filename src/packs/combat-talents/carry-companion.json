      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Beastmastery sphere.</p>\n<p>You can touch an animal ally as a standard action, instantly transforming the creature into a small figurine of stone, small enough to fit in your palm. The animal ally must be a willing subject for this talent to take effect. Any items the creature is wearing (such as a harness or saddle) or carrying (such as equipment stowed in saddlebags) are transformed and miniaturized along with the creature.</p>\n<p>While miniaturized, the animal ally is under an effect similar to a flesh to stone spell. The animal ally is mindless and inert, and does not appear to be alive when viewed with spells like deathwatch or the Divine Life Divination sphere talent. You may return the animal ally to its normal form at any time by placing the figurine on the ground, touching it, and speaking a command word. Otherwise, the animal ally remains in miniature form unless the effect is broken, such as by dispel magic or other similar effects. If the figurine is broken or damaged, the creature, when returned to its original form, has similar damage or deformities unless repaired. This is a supernatural ability.</p>\n",
