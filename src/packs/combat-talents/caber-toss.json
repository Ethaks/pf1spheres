      "value": "<p>You are considered proficient with thrown cabers, which are normally used for breaking up military formations.</p>\n<p>You can hurl cabers up to two size categories larger than you. A &#8220;caber&#8221; is any long, thick, and relatively cylindrical shaped object made of any material with a hardness of 5 or less, that is at least 5 feet in length, such as a wooden beam or massive leg bone. Cabers are considered two-handed exotic thrown weapons and deal quadruple damage on a critical hit. You can hurl the caber as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 5 feet + 5 feet per size category it is smaller than you, targeting a square (AC 5) within range. Success means that you create a line of difficult terrain originating from the target square (in the direction of your choice), and everyone in the line&#8217;s area must attempt a Reflex save or take bludgeoning damage as if hit by the caber. The difficult terrain lasts as long as the caber remains in the area; moving, picking up, or destroying the caber similarly affects the difficult terrain. Failing to hit the target square results in the caber taking the damage itself, the GM randomly determines the direction of the line of difficult terrain using a d8, and everyone in the line&#8217;s area automatically succeed their Reflex save.</p>\n<p>As long as you have martial focus and a suitable caber in your reach, you may pick them up as part of your attack. At +7 and +14 base attack bonus increase the maximum size caber you can throw by one size category.</p>\n<strong>Cabers: Affected Area and Damage by Size</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Caber Size</th>\n<th>Affected Area</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5-ft. line</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>10-ft. line</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>20-ft. line</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>50-ft. line</td>\n<td>2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n<td>100-ft. line</td>\n<td>2d8</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n",
