      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Boxing sphere, counter punch ability,
      Launching Uppercut.</p>

      <p>Whenever you launch a hostile creature into the air with your Launching
      Uppercut talent, you may make an Acrobatics check to jump into the air
      next to them as an immediate action (this movement does not provoke
      attacks of opportunity). If you manage to jump at least as high as the
      target was launched, you may make an attack of opportunity against that
      creature, knocking them back to the ground immediately where they suffer
      falling damage and are not allowed a saving throw to avoid falling
      prone.</p>

      <p>You descend back to the ground at the end of the target&#8217;s turn,
      and do not suffer falling damage for the distance you jumped.</p>
