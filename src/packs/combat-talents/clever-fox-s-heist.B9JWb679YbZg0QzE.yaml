    value: >
      <p>You channel the fox, weaving expert thievery with grace. You may
      perform the dirty trick or steal combat maneuver as an attack of
      opportunity. You cannot apply (trick) talents to a combat maneuver
      performed this way unless you expend martial focus or spend an additional
      attack of opportunity.</p>

      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick or steal combat
      maneuver as an attack of opportunity, as an immediate action, you may move
      up to half your base speed. This movement does not provoke an attack of
      opportunity from the target of your dirty trick or steal. If you take an
      action to move during your next turn, subtract the amount of movement you
      made using this ability from your total movement.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Fox Trickery.</p>

      <p><strong>Special:</strong> If you would be granted an attack of
      opportunity against a target because of a dirty trick or steal combat
      maneuver you performed, such as a (trick) causing the target to provoke an
      attack of opportunity, you may not use this talent to perform a dirty
      trick or steal maneuver as an attack of opportunity.</p>
