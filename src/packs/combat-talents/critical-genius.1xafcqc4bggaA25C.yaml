    value: >
      <p>You may select 1 weapon with which you are proficient (including
      unarmed strike), treating that weapon as though its critical threat range
      was 19-20 (unless it would be higher) and its critical multiplier as
      though it was x2 (even if it would normally be higher). In addition, when
      you confirm a critical hit with the chosen weapon while using the attack
      action, you deal additional damage equal to your base attack bonus; this
      additional damage is applied after other modifiers and is not multiplied
      by the critical hit. At +10 base attack bonus, the chosen weapon&#8217;s
      critical threat range is instead treated as 18-20.</p>

      <p><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The change in critical threat range and
      critical multiplier from this talent is applied before other modifiers,
      such as the keen weapon property or the weapon mastery class feature.</p>
