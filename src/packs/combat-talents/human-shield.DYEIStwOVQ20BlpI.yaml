    value: >
      <p>Whenever you are the target of an attack, you may perform a reposition
      combat maneuver against an impaled creature as an immediate action without
      provoking an attack of opportunity. You may reposition the impaled enemy
      into occupied squares other than your own, but they are shunted to the
      nearest unoccupied square after the attack resolves. If the impaled
      creature&#8217;s new position would place them in the path of the attack
      targeting you, the attack is instead rolled against them.</p>
