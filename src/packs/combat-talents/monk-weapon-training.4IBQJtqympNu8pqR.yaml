      <p>You gain proficiency with all weapons with the monk special feature. If
      you have this talent and either the brawler&#8217;s flurry or flurry of
      blows class feature, you may make one additional attack with a weapon in
      this group as a free action whenever you make an attack action with a
      weapon from this group or an unarmed strike, but both attacks take a -2
      penalty. You must decide whether or not to use this ability before making
      the first attack roll for your attack action. Attacks made using this
      ability apply your full Strength bonus to the damage roll, regardless of
      whether the weapon is wielded with two hands or with an off-hand.</p>
