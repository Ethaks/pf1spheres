      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a Steal or Dirty Trick maneuver
      against an opponent within your reach, you may make a Sleight of Hand
      check against their CMD. If successful, the opponent is entangled until
      the start of your next turn, and you may spend an immediate action to move
      to any other occupied space adjacent to the target creature and regain
      your martial focus.</p>
