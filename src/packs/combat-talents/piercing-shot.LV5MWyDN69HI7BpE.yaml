      <p>Your deadly shot pierces the target and can strike another creature in
      line behind it. You must be able to trace a line starting at your space
      and passing through both targets to make this additional attack. The
      secondary attack is made at a &#8211;4 penalty, in addition to any
      modifiers for added range; additional targets cannot be outside your
      normal maximum range. If the secondary attack also successfully damages
      its target, the projectile can continue to hit another target, but the -4
      penalties for each additional target continue to stack.</p>
