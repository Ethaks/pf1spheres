      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 20</p>

      <p>You create a single use bag of improved flash powder that can be thrown
      as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 20 ft. Creatures within
      a 10-ft. radius burst of the point of contact are blinded for 1 round
      unless they succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against this effect. You
      can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; each time you
      do so, the radius increases by 10 ft. and the duration of the blindness
      increases by 1 round.</p>
