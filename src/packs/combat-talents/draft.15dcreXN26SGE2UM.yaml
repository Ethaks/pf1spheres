      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, Diplomacy 5
      ranks.</p>

      <p>You may expend martial focus as a standard action to force a creature
      which you can recruit within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 base
      attack bonus) to make a Will save or have its attitude improved to helpful
      and serve you as a cohort for 1 minute per rank in Diplomacy you possess.
      Creatures not of the humanoid type gain a +2 bonus on their Will saves.
      Once a creature saves successfully against your use of this ability, it is
      immune to further uses of this ability by you for 24 hours. When the
      duration of the recruit effect ends, the creature returns to its previous
      disposition, modified by any other effects that would have altered it in
      the meantime.</p>

      <p>Attempting to make the creature perform an obviously suicidal action
      automatically releases it, even if you possess the Brainwash legendary
      talent. This is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability.</p>
