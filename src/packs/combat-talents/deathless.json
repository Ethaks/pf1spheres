You must make this decision as soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn&#8217;t your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.</p>\n<p>When using this talent, you are staggered. You can take a move action without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some swift actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If your negative hit points are equal to or greater than twice your Constitution score, you immediately die. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Diehard.</p>\n",
