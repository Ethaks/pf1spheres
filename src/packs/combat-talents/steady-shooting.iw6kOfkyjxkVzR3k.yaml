      <p>You have mastered techniques for making firearms more reliable and
      accurate at the expense of power. When firing a firearm as an attack
      action, you may ignore its misfire chance, but the weapon targets normal
      AC instead of touch AC. When firing a firearm in this manner, treat its
      range increment as 10 ft. longer than it actually is, plus an additional
      10 ft. for every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess.</p>
