    value: >
      <p>Whenever a weapon attack (not including siege weapons, or other massive
      weapons) misses a creature benefiting from your active defense, you may
      choose a new target for the attack within its original range (for ranged
      attacks) or reach (for melee attacks) as a free action that can be taken
      even when it&#8217;s not your turn, comparing the original attack roll,
      with a -2 penalty, to the new target&#8217;s AC and resolving the attack
      as normal on a successful hit.</p>
