      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you are always considered to have a
      running start when attempting an Acrobatics check to jump.</p>

      <p>As a move action, you may store kinetic energy. Kinetic energy may be
      stored indefinitely, but you may only have one instance of stored kinetic
      energy at any time.</p>

      <p>Whenever you move more than 5 feet during your turn using a movement
      mode corresponding to a package you possess, you may expend this stored
      kinetic energy to increase your speed with that package by +10 feet,
      increasing by +10 for every 5 ranks in a skill associated with a package
      you possess.</p>
