This must have been a trap you could setup as a single full-round action, and you must still succeed on the skill check to place it there successfully. If the creature has the ability to notice the presence of traps without actively searching (such as with the Heightened Awareness talent or See Hazard sense), they get to make a free Perception check against the DC to spot the trap, and if they succeed, do not trigger the trap.</p>\n<p>You may take this talent a second time when you possess 10 ranks in Craft (traps), to be able to apply alchemical, magical, and technological items, as well as other dart or snare types you know, as part of the trap (you must still possess the ability and resources to do so).</p>\n",
