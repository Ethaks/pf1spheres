    value: >
      <p>Whenever you perform an attack action, attack of opportunity, or
      additional attack granted by a class feature or talent with shuriken, you
      may throw two identical shuriken at once. If you do so, increase the size
      of the shuriken&#8217;s base damage die by three steps (1d6 Medium, 1d4
      Small) instead of hitting twice.</p>

      <p>Abilities that would negate a single attack only stop one shuriken per
      use, removing the damage die increase but failing to prevent the attack
      entirely if only one shuriken is negated. Abilities that replace the base
      damage die of the weapon such as the warpriest&#8217;s sacred weapon do
      not stack with this talent.</p>
