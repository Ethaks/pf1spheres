      "value": "<p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 15</p>\n<p>You create a single-use jar filled with a durable chemical foam that expands to fill an area when shattered. This item can be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet into an unoccupied square capable of supporting an object as a standard action.</p>\n<p>The foam fills an area with a radius of 10 feet + 5 feet per 5 ranks in Craft (alchemy) with semi-solid foam. A 5-foot block of foam possesses a break DC equal to your Alchemy sphere DC and has a number of hit points equal to your ranks in Craft (alchemy). A creature may attempt to move through the foam during their turn, requiring a successful break attempt for every 5 feet they pass through. On a failed break attempt they can no longer move through the foam and their movement ends. Creatures in the radius are allowed a Reflex save to be pushed to a square at the edge of the radius to avoid entrapment. Creatures that fail their Reflex save may attack the foam or try other means of escape as described above.</p>\n<p>The foam also serves a cushioning function preventing 15 feet of fall damage for every 5 feet of foam exists between the ground and the point where the falling individual touches the foam.</p>\n<p>This foam is porous to oxygen, and cannot be used to suffocate a creature, and too light to deal damage as a falling object. The foam dissipates on its own after 1 minute.</p>\n<p>You can increase the Craft DC of this item in increments of 10; each time you do so, each 5-foot square of foam gains 5 additional hit points, and lasts for an additional minute.</p>\n",
