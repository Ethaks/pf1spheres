      <p>As an immediate action, you fall prone and gain the benefits of the
      evasion ability until the start of your next turn. At the beginning of
      your next turn, if you have martial focus, you may stand up as a move
      action without provoking attacks of opportunity. At 10 base attack bonus,
      you may use this talent as a free action that can be taken even when it is
      not your turn and gain improved evasion.</p>
