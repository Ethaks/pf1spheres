      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, 5 ranks in either
      Acrobatics, Climb, or Fly.</p>

      <p>When using a movement mode associated with a package you possess, you
      may expend martial focus as a swift action to complete your movement
      without passing through any intervening squares. This does not allow you
      to reach any space you would not normally be able to reach with associate
      movement modes you posses. You may use this ability to charge through
      difficult or obstructed terrain as long as you are aware of the position
      of your target. This is a supernatural teleportation effect.</p>
