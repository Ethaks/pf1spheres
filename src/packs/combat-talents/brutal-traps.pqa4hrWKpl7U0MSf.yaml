      <p>A creature that fails its Reflex save to avoid this snare is subject to
      a bull rush as if the trap successfully beat their CMD by 1 +1 for every 2
      ranks in Craft (traps) you possess. This counts as you performing the bull
      rush as a standard action for the purposes of Brute sphere abilities (a
      trap deals 1d4 damage with a Strength bonus of +0 for talents such as
      Smash). Creatures targeted by this trap get a +1 circumstance bonus on
      their saving throw for each size category they are larger than Medium.</p>
