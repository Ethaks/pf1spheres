      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Leadership sphere.</p>

      <p>You can recruit cohorts from far-off realms. Such cohorts are built
      like a normal cohort, but are Small or Medium creatures with the
      aberration type, and benefit from the Conjuration sphere Aberrant Creature
      (type) talent as if they were a Conjuration companion. As you recruit by
      calling on creatures from alien realms, you do not actually have to be at
      a settlement in order to recruit cohorts this way. You treat this as if
      recruiting from a metropolis and the population is always at least 50% of
      the particular race you are seeking.</p>
