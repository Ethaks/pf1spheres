      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you gain +1 attack of opportunity
      per round. You may make attacks of opportunity even when flat-footed.
      These additional attacks of opportunity stack with those granted by the
      Combat Reflexes or Muscular Reflexes feat. For every 4 points of base
      attack bonus you possess, you gain an additional attack of
      opportunity.</p>
