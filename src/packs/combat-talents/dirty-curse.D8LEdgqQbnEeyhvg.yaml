      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere, Sleight of Hand 7
      ranks.</p>

      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick combat maneuver, the
      effects of that dirty trick are treated as a curse with a caster level
      equal to your ranks in Sleight of Hand, and a spell level equal to 1/2
      your ranks in Sleight of Hand (maximum 9th) for the purposes of being able
      to remove it. This does not extend the duration of the dirty trick&#8217;s
      effect. A creature may only be cursed by this talent once per day. This is
      a supernatural effect.</p>
