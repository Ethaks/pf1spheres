      <p>When you bull rush, drag, or reposition a creature into another
      creature, you may make a trip attempt as a free action that does not
      provoke an attack of opportunity against the second creature, even if that
      creature is not within your reach. If you fail the trip attempt by 5 or
      more the creature cannot make a trip attempt against you in return.</p>
