      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Warleader sphere, Diplomacy 6
      ranks.</p>

      <p>You may make Diplomacy checks to improve the attitude of undead,
      including mindless undead. Undead creatures with an attitude of friendly
      or better towards you can benefit from any morale bonuses, teamwork feats,
      or mind-affecting effects your shouts or tactics would bestow, and
      mindless undead whose attitude has been improved to friendly will follow
      your orders to the best of their ability, though undead who are not
      closely watched may quickly revert to their prior inclinations. If the
      undead is under the control of a creature (such as a spellcaster or cleric
      using the Command Undead feat), the orders of that creature still
      supercede your own.</p>
