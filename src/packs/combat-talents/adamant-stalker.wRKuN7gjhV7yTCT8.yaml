    value: >
      <p>Whenever a creature within your threatened area attempts to take a
      5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate
      action so long as you end your movement with the creature in your
      threatened range. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step
      during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next
      turn, subtract 5 ft. from your total movement. You can select this talent
      a second time; if you do, the creature also provokes an attack of
      opportunity from you at the end of your movement.</p>
