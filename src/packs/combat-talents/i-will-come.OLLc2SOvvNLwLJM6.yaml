      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Guardian sphere, I Will Hear, Defend
      Other, base attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>When a creature calls you with the I Will Hear talent, you may spend a
      full-round action to teleport to their location. You can bring along
      objects as long as their weight doesn&#8217;t exceed your maximum load.
      You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature
      (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per
      three points of base attack bonus you possess. A Large creature counts as
      two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and
      so forth. All creatures to be teleported must be in contact with one
      another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.
      You arrive in the safe space nearest to the calling creature that is large
      enough for you and any creatures you bring along to occupy. You are
      exhausted for 10 minutes after using this ability, and fatigued for 1 hour
      thereafter. You may expend focus as a free action to delay these
      conditions for a number of rounds equal to your base attack bonus. You
      incur the penalties of these conditions even if you are immune to the
      exhausted and fatigued conditions. You may attempt to use this ability
      while exhausted or fatigued, but doing so incurs a 50% chance that the
      ability fails to work; regardless of whether you succeed at this attempt,
      you suffer 1d6 points of Constitution damage and the duration of the
      exhausted and fatigued conditions caused by using this ability are
      doubled. You may only travel to a particular creature using this ability
      once per day. This is a supernatural teleportation effect.</p>
