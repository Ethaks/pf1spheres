    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully make an attack with a weapon wielded in one
      hand in the same round you make an attack action (including the attack
      action itself), you can move 5 ft. as a free action; this movement
      doesn&#8217;t provoke attacks of opportunity from the creature attacked.
      You cannot move in this way if you haven&#8217;t made an attack action yet
      that round. You can also use an attack roll in place of a Perform (dance)
      check in order to make money. At +10 base attack bonus, you can instead
      move 10 ft., and you may roll twice for the attack roll used in place of a
      Perform (dance) check, taking the better result.</p>
