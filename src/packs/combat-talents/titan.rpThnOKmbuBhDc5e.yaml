      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brute sphere, Muscular Surge, Giant,
      base attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>Your carrying capacity multiplier from the Giant talent increases from
      x2 to x10.</p>

      <p>You are always considered as being one size larger than you are for the
      purpose of who you may target with combat maneuvers and for talents that
      have effects dependent on size. If you have expended your martial focus
      with the Muscular Surge talent, you are considered two size categories
      larger for the duration.</p>

      <p>If you possess Strong Lungs from the Athletics sphere, you may add your
      bonus from Muscular Surge to your Constitution score when determining how
      many rounds you may run or hold your breath.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Oversized Weapons legendary talent from the
      Equipment sphere, you may wield weapons of any size without increasing the
      effort required (i.e., you do not increase the weapon&#8217;s category by
      1 step from light to one-handed, one-handed to two-handed, etc.), though
      you still suffer a -2 penalty on attack rolls for each size category the
      weapon is larger than you.</p>
