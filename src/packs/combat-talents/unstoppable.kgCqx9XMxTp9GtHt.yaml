    value: >
      <p>When making a charge, you can push your way through obstacles blocking
      your path, be they creatures, objects, or others.</p>

      <p>You may charge over difficult terrain. This movement still costs twice
      as much as normal. Additionally, when making a charge, you may attempt to
      overrun a creature in the path of the charge, or to make a Strength check
      to break an unattended object such as a door or wall that is in your way,
      as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the
      check is successful, you may complete the charge. If the check is
      unsuccessful, the charge ends in the space directly in front of that
      creature or object.</p>

      <p>For every 5 base attack bonus you possess you may attempt to break or
      overrun an additional target, but suffer a cumulative -2 penalty on each
      additional check made.</p>

      <p>This can allow you to initiate a charge through squares that you do not
      have line of sight to. You may resolve your charge attack against any
      valid target within reach of the charge&#8217;s path after passing through
      the barriers (creature or object) blocking your line of sight.
      <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Charge Through.</p>
