      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere (Iai Slash (bleed)),
      base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>You may spend a move action and expend your martial focus to
      elaborately sheathe one held weapon without provoking attacks of
      opportunity and glare at nearby enemies. Each enemy within 30 feet of you
      currently suffering from bleed damage dealt by your blooded strike
      suddenly spasms and hemorrhages blood, suffering 1d6 bludgeoning, slashing
      and piercing damage, plus an additional 1d6 for every 3 points of base
      attack bonuses you possess. If you possess Perforating Wounds, the
      creature suffers an additional 2d6 damage for every stack of that talent
      applied to them. After suffering this damage, any bleed damage dealt due
      to your Duelist sphere abilities immediately end.</p>

      <p>If you possess Defiant Focus, you do not need to expend your martial
      focus to use this ability.</p>
