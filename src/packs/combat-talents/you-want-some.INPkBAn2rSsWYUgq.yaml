    value: >
      <p>If you have an alcoholic beverage (or other non-directly harmful
      liquid) in one hand when you make an attack action, you can force the
      target of the attack action to drink from it if you succeed on the attack
      action and the target is within your natural reach. Forcing a creature to
      drink an alcoholic beverage grants them a Reflex save to avoid drinking,
      and on failure makes that creature sickened for 1 round, and potentially
      other effects based off the drink (such as gaining the drunk
      condition).</p>

      <p>Additionally, when you succeed on a check made to maintain a grapple,
      you can choose to force a creature to drink from an alcoholic beverage you
      have in your hand instead of the other options, or you can make a joint
      move action as part of the grapple check to draw a beverage and force the
      creature to drink from it, applying the same effects as above. At +10 base
      attack bonus, you can instead force a creature to drink a magical potion
      or beverage, or any other directly harmful drink (such as a mug of lava or
      acid, or a poisoned mug of alcohol).</p>
