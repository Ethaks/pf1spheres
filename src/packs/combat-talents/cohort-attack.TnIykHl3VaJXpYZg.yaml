      <p>When you use the attack action to attack, one of your cohorts may also
      attack your target with a single weapon it possesses as a joint swift
      action. If both you and the cohort successfully deal damage with these
      attacks, the cohort may immediately move 5 feet as a free action. This
      movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
