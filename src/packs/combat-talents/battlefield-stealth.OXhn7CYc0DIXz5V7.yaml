      <p>Whenever you or an ally would apply an effect which would cause a
      creature or creatures to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC, you may spend
      martial focus to attempt a Stealth check against those creatures as an
      immediate action. Your Stealth automatically ends if you do not enter
      cover or concealment, or use this ability again, by the end of your next
      turn.</p>
