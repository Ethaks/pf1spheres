      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Shield sphere (Flexible Cover), base
      attack bonus +7.</p>

      <p>Whenever you use flexible cover, your shield provides total cover
      regardless of what type of shield it is and provides total cover against
      targeted spells.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Cover Ally talent, when you use cover ally to grant
      your active defense to an ally, you may expend martial focus as an
      immediate action to grant that ally total cover against a single attack.
      Using cover ally this way cannot be used in conjunction with the Extensive
      Defense talent.</p>
