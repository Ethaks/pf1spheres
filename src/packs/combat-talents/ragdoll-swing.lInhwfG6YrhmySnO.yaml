      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you may use a creature you are
      currently impaling with a wielded weapon as an improvised weapon of that
      creature&#8217;s size, taking no penalties on attack rolls for doing so.
      This talent does not allow you to wield a creature of a larger size than
      you normally could wield as an improvised weapon. Each successful attack
      you make while using the impaled creature as a weapon deals damage to the
      impaled creature equal to half your base attack bonus.</p>
