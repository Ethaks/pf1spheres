    value: >
      <p>On a successful deadly shot, you aim for the target&#8217;s eyes,
      seeking to take away their vision. The first time you hit a target while
      using this ability, they are dazzled for 1d4 rounds; if you successfully
      use this ability against a target already suffering from the dazzled
      condition, they are instead blinded for 1 minute. The blind condition can
      be removed with a DC 20 Heal check, or when the target receives at least 1
      hit point of healing. If your base attack bonus is +10 or higher, you may
      use the blinding option of this ability even if the target is not
      dazzled.</p>
