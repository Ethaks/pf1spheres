      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Open Hand sphere, Mystic Fists, base
      attack bonus +15.</p>

      <p>When making an attack action with an unarmed strike, you may expend
      your martial focus. Any creature struck must make a Will save or become
      ethereal for 1 round per point of base attack bonus you possess. They may
      attempt a new Will save each round as a full-round action to end this
      effect early. Once a creature has become ethereal via this talent, you may
      not affect them with it again for 24 hours, though other creatures may use
      it on them normally. This is a supernatural effect.</p>
