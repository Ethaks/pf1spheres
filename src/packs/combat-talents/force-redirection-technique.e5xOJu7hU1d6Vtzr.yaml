      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Equipment sphere.</p>

      <p>You may use your Strength modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier
      to AC, up to a maximum of 3 + half of your base attack bonus. Characters
      who gain Climb or Swim as a class skill may instead choose to have the cap
      increase by +1 for every 2 ranks in the listed class skill they possess.
      Your bonus to AC is still affected by anything that would limit or remove
      your Dexterity modifier to AC such as wearing armor or being flat-footed.
      You may disable or enable Force Redirection Technique as a free action at
      the start of your turn, once per turn.</p>
