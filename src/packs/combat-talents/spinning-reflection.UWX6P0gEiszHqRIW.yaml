      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dual Wielding sphere, base attack bonus
      +5.</p>

      <p>While in this stance, you begin to spin your main-hand and off-hand
      weapons rapidly in front of you. Whenever a weapon attack roll is made
      against you (and you are aware of it), you may attempt to disrupt the
      attack before it can harm you. Unusually massive weapons and attacks
      generated by spell effects cannot be deflected in this way.</p>

      <p>You can expend an attack of opportunity and make a melee attack roll
      with both your main-hand and off-hand weapons, both at your highest bonus
      (but suffering the penalties associated with dual attack to both attacks).
      If one result is greater than the attack roll total of the attack, the
      attack deals half damage, before applying damage reduction and similar
      abilities. If both results are greater than the attack, the attempted
      attack misses you completely.</p>
