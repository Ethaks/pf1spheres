    value: >
      <p>Whenever you wield a melee weapon in one hand and a ranged weapon in
      the other, you don&#8217;t provoke attacks of opportunity from firing or
      reloading while threatened. If you successfully attack two different
      creatures more than 5 ft. apart from each other in the same round you make
      an attack using the attack action, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on
      damage rolls against each creature until the end of your next turn; for
      every 5 base attack bonus you have, this bonus increases by +2.</p>
