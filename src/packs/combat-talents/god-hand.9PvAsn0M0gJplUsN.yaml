    value: >
      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Open Hand sphere, Mystic Fists, base
      attack bonus +10.</p>

      <p>Your unarmed strikes cause all fast healing and regeneration a creature
      may possess to cease functioning for 1 round.</p>

      <p>Whenever you deal damage to a creature or object with your unarmed
      strike using an attack action, if that creature would be reduced to 0 or
      fewer hit points, it is instantly killed and transformed into fine dust.
      If you deal damage in this manner to an object, reducing the object to 0
      hp disintegrates the object (or a 10 ft. cube, if the object is
      particularly large). This is a supernatural effect.</p>
