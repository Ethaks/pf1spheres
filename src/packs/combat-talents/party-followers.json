      "value": "<p>In some games, especially those focused on a traveling group larger than a normal adventuring party, rather than have one player shoulder the burden of spending character resources to have a group of followers and cohorts, the party as a whole could be allowed to gain talents. This could be done in various ways, such as allowing each PC to contribute talents into a group pool. One &#8216;leader&#8217; would take the base sphere and benefit from the bonus skill ranks, while others could add additional talents, reflecting the cohorts and followers they attract with their skills. Anyone who possesses a (cohort) talent would be able to use it with any of the shared party cohorts.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the base sphere could simply be granted to the group, with bonus skill ranks removed, then additional talents granted at appropriate intervals based on level, achievement, or wealth (either accumulated or spent). This can be used to reflect being part of a mercenary company, trading caravan, or other group.</p>\n",
