      "value": "<p>When you succeed at a disarm combat maneuver check against a creature, instead of disarming their weapon you may choose to bind their weapon to yours. This attempt may be made against creatures even if they are wielding nothing but natural attacks or unarmed strikes. As long as the creature&#8217;s weapon is bound, they cannot move from the square they currently occupy. A creature whose weapon is bound may release the weapon as a free action or attempt to break the bind as a standard action by making a successful combat maneuver check against your disarm CMD. If the bound weapon is a natural attack or unarmed strike, the creature must succeed at a successful combat maneuver check to break the bind. You cannot attack with the weapon or limb used to bind a creature as long as the bind is in effect, but may end the bind at any time as a free action. Binding a creature&#8217;s weapon counts as a disarm for talents and abilities that require a disarm check or attempt.</p>\n",
