      <p>Whenever you successfully make an attack with your counter punch, you
      may force the creature hit by your counter punch to make a successful
      Fortitude save or be sickened and have all of their movement speeds
      reduced by 1/2 for 1 round. For every 5 points of base attack bonus you
      possess, the duration of this talent is increased by 1 round.</p>
