      <p>You quick eyes often lead your deft hands into picking up a small,
      purring companion. Often one that doesn&#8217;t belong to you.</p>

      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Sleight of Hand 5 ranks, Scoundrel
      sphere (Master Thief).</p>

      <p>You may perform the steal combat maneuver against a target that has
      another creature secured on their person (such as a familiar inside of a
      satchel or a creature riding atop a mount).</p>

      <p>A creature you attempt to steal this way must be at least 2 sizes
      smaller than you. If successful, you steal that creature. An unwilling
      creature stolen this way is treated as being subject to a successful
      grapple combat maneuver.</p>

      <p>A grapple combat maneuver performed and maintained using this talent is
      unique; you may perform steal combat maneuvers in place of grapple combat
      maneuvers to maintain this unique grapple and do not gain the grappled
      condition until the start of your next turn after initiating this unique
      grapple, allowing you to move normally and bring a grappled creature with
      you during your movement the same turn you steal them before continuing to
      grapple them normally.</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is normally no check to hide a creature on
      your person; even a familiar stored away in a satchel would need to
      attempt checks to be hidden. For the purposes of this talent, a character
      may identify that there is a creature hidden on the target&#8217;s person
      with a Perception check (DC 10 + the target&#8217;s Sleight of Hand
      bonus), such as inside a satchel or coat pocket.</p>
