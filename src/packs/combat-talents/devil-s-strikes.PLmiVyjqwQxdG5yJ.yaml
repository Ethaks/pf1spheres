      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Open Hand sphere, base attack bonus
      +6.</p>

      <p>You may spend a move action to rapidly spin in place, generating heat
      and friction that cause the next unarmed strike you make before the start
      of your next turn to deal an additional amount of fire damage equal to
      your base attack bonus. While this talent is active, the hellish flames
      around your limbs cause your unarmed strikes to be treated as magical
      weapons when attacking incorporeal creatures; if your unarmed strikes
      would already be magical, such as because you are currently wearing an
      amulet of mighty fists, they instead deal full damage against incorporeal
      creatures. Creatures killed while this talent is active require those
      attempting to resurrect them to make a caster level check equal to 10 +
      your base attack bonus or fail. This is a supernatural effect.</p>
