    value: >
      <p>You may increase the power of a tame creature through intense training.
      You may grant a tame creature 1 bonus Hit Die for every hour you spend
      training it with a Handle Animal check with a DC of 10 + the
      creature&#8217;s new Hit Dice total. These additional Hit Dice count
      against your Hit Dice cap for the trainer ability as normal and cannot
      cause the creature&#8217;s Hit Dice to exceed your ranks in Handle Animal.
      These additional Hit Dice are multiplied as normal for companions that
      have their Hit Dice doubled for the purposes of determining how many
      creatures you may have tame. If a creature is released from the tame
      condition, these bonus Hit Dice are lost immediately.</p>

      <p>Creatures do not gain size increases for these additional Hit Dice.
      Additional feats and skill points from these Hit Dice are assigned by the
      GM unless you possess the Purposeful Training talent, in which case they
      may be assigned within the limits of the retraining granted by that
      talent. This ability can never be applied to an animal companion or
      familiar.</p>
