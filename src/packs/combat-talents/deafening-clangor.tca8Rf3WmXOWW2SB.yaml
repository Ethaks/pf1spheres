      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Gladiator sphere, Strike Fear
      (demoralization), Shield sphere, Intimidate 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>Whenever you perform the strike fear demoralization, you may choose to
      strike a shield you are wielding with a weapon or limb to produce a
      deafening clangor. All targets (excluding yourself) within your strike
      fear range must pass a Fortitude save or become deafened for 1d4+1 rounds.
      You may warn your allies as a free action to cover their ears and protect
      them from the effects of the deafening clangor, but doing so gives enemies
      a +5 bonus to their saving throw against this effect.</p>
