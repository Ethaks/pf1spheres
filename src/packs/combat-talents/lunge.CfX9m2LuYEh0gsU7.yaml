      <p>As long as you have martial focus, you may increase the range at which
      you may make melee attacks by 5 ft., but suffer a -2 penalty to attack
      rolls made against targets within this extended range. This does not
      affect your threatened area, only the reach of your attacks, and does not
      stack with other, similar effects. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong>
      Lunge.</p>
