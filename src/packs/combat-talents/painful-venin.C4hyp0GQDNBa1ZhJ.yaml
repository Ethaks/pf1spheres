      <p>In addition to making the target fatigued, the target also suffers
      damage equal to 1/2 your ranks in Craft (alchemy) (minimum 1). This damage
      happens before resolving the effect of the poison.</p>

      <p><strong>Addendum [Apoc]:</strong> You can take this talent a second
      time. If you do, the damage from this talent applies to all your Alchemy
      sphere poisons. When creating a poison with this (toxin) talent, this
      extra damage stacks with the poison&#8217;s normal damage.</p>
