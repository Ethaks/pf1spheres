    value: >
      <p>You can expend your martial focus to make a grapple check against two
      different creatures within your reach as a standard action. If your
      grapple check is successful against both creatures, you can grapple both
      creatures simultaneously, although you must be adjacent to both creatures
      while maintaining a grapple against them. Whenever you make a check to
      maintain the grapple, you use the result against both creature&#8217;s CMD
      with a -4 penalty to your combat maneuver bonus in order to maintain the
      grapple against both creatures, and both creatures gain a +4 on their
      combat maneuver checks to end the grapple. If you use a (slam) talent, you
      can spend a move action in addition to the swift action required to use a
      slam to use it against both grappled creatures. For every 5 points of base
      attack bonus you possess, this penalty to CMD and bonus to combat maneuver
      checks is reduced by 1/-1 respectively.</p>
