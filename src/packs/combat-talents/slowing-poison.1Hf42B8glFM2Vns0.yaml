    value: >
      <p>You may choose for your poison to halve all the creature&#8217;s speeds
      instead of making them fatigued. Apply this reduction to a
      creature&#8217;s speeds after any other reductions. Creatures who fail two
      consecutive saving throws against this poison have their speeds reduced to
      a quarter of their normal amounts, and creatures who fail three
      consecutive saving throws have their speeds reduced to 5 feet. This cannot
      reduce a target&#8217;s speed to less than 5 feet.</p>
