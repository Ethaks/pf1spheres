      <p>While in this stance, you can use any long, flexible objects like
      strings, ropes, sashes, chains, etc. as an extension of your own body. As
      part of the action you use to enter this stance, you may draw or pick up
      an unattended object within reach capable of use with this talent. While
      holding such an object in your hand, you may use it to increase your
      natural reach for grabbing objects, manipulating objects, and performing
      the bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, drag, steal, and trip maneuvers. The
      increased reach is limited by the length of the object used, to a maximum
      of 10 feet.</p>

      <p>For every 4 base attack bonus you possess, the maximum potential reach
      of the object increases by 5 feet and you gain a +1 bonus to CMB for
      combat maneuvers made with the object. These objects count as grappling
      hooks for the purposes of talents such as Get Over Here! and Rope
      Swing.</p>
