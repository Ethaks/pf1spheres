      <p>Whenever you successfully make an attack with your counter punch, you
      gain DR 2/- until the beginning of your next turn, although this damage
      reduction is lost if you move more than 5 ft. during your turn. For every
      3 points of base attack bonus you possess, this damage reduction increases
      by 1.</p>
