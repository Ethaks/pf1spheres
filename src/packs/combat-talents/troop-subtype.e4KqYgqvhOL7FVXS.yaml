      <p>The troop subtype represents an organized group of trained soldiers
      that act as a unit, rather than as individuals. A troop is something of an
      abstraction, in that the component creatures that make up the troop are
      mostly irrelevant; only the troop as a whole matters for the purposes of
      combat. A troop is similar to a swarm, but is normally composed of Small
      or Medium creatures. Large groups of Tiny or smaller creatures should use
      the normal swarm rules.</p>

      <p><strong>Traits:</strong> A troop is not subject to flanking, but it is
      subject to critical hits and sneak attacks if its component creatures are
      subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 hit points or fewer causes
      it to break up, effectively destroying the troop, though the damage taken
      until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist
      attack.</p>

      <p>All troops gain the following traits.</p>

      <p><strong>Troop Subtype:</strong> A troop is a collection of creatures
      that acts as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but typically as part
      of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as
      noted here. A troop has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single
      initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single armor class. A troop
      makes saving throws as a single creature. A single troop occupies a
      20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though
      the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component
      creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shape-able, though
      the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the
      teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of
      the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move
      through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment,
      although the troop provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A
      troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures.
      The exact number of a troop&#8217;s component creatures varies, but in
      general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12
      to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied
      by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of
      the component creatures.</p>

      <p>A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Immunity to being Tripped or Bull Rushed:</strong> A troop
      cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, except by area effects that
      include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent.</p>

      <p><strong>Immunity to Single Target Spells:</strong> A troop is immune to
      any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including
      single-target spells such as disintegrate and multiple target spells such
      as haste), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area
      or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as fireball or mass hold
      monster).</p>

      <p><strong>Vulnerable to Area Effect Spells:</strong> A troop takes half
      again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If
      a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage, it disperses
      and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Troop Attack:</strong> Creatures with the troop subtype
      don&#8217;t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic
      damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end
      of their move, with no attack roll needed. A troop&#8217;s stat block has
      &#8220;troop&#8221; in its Melee entry with no attack bonus given. The
      amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice. Unless stated
      otherwise, a troop&#8217;s attacks are non-magical. Damage reduction
      sufficient to reduce a troop attack&#8217;s damage to 0 or other special
      abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the
      troop&#8217;s attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in
      addition to normal damage. Troops threaten all creatures within their
      reach or within their area, and attempt attacks of opportunity as normal
      with their troop attack.</p>

      <p><strong>Chaos of Combat:</strong> Because of the chaos of combat,
      spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or
      within its reach requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level).
      Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful
      DC 20 Will save.</p>
