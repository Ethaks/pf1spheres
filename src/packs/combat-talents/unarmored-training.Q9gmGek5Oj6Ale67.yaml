    value: >
      <p>Your deft movements, physical conditioning, and expert use of your
      chosen weapons allow you to create a protective barrier around yourself as
      effective as any true suit of armor. When unarmored and unencumbered, you
      gain a +3 armor bonus to your AC. This bonus increases by +1 for every 3
      points of base attack bonus you possess. Characters who gain Acrobatics as
      a class skill may instead choose to have the armor bonus increase by +1
      for every 3 ranks in the Acrobatics skill they possess.</p>

      <p>This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you are
      flat-footed. You lose these bonuses when you are immobilized or helpless,
      when you wear any armor, or when you carry a medium or heavy load. These
      bonuses do not stack with the AC bonus class feature of the monk or
      similar abilities.</p>

      <p>This bonus depends on an intricate awareness of the practitioner's body
      and balance, and as such is lost when the target is under any shapeshift
      other than blank form, or is polymorphed into a creature of the animal,
      dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin type.</p>
