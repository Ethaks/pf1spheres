      <p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Barrage sphere.</p>

      <p>So long as you have at least 10 pieces of ammunition of a particular
      non-magical type, you may fire as many pieces of that ammunition as you
      desire without actually expending your ammunition.</p>

      <p>When the combat is finished, you cannot retrieve more pieces of
      ammunition than you had before the combat began; you always end the combat
      with the same amount of ammunition you started with. This is a
      supernatural effect.</p>
