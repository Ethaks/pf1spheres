      <p>Your followers can quickly deliver messages via rider, messenger bird,
      and other means as appropriate to the setting. While with your followers,
      you may send written messages and items not exceeding 10 lbs. per rank in
      Diplomacy to any place reachable by normal travel (not requiring the
      casting of magical effects) at a base overland speed of 60 miles per day,
      increasing by 10 miles at 4 ranks in Diplomacy and every 4 ranks
      thereafter.</p>

      <p>Messengers can also be used to deliver items to and retrieve them from
      your followers or caravan while adventuring, though as normal for
      followers they won&#8217;t go anywhere apparently dangerous. A messenger
      may be summoned by messenger bird, whistle, or, if possessed, magical
      means.</p>

      <p>If you possess the Merchants talent, whenever you fail an item
      availability roll, you can send messengers to obtain the item in nearby
      settlements. Roll for the availability of the item in the nearest
      settlement, rolling again for each successively further settlement until
      the item is available. You may obtain the item in a number of days based
      on the overland speed of your messengers and the distance to the
      settlement.</p>
