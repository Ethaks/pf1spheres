      <p>You gain proficiency with the butterfly knife, longsword, rapier,
      scimitar, spiral rapier, and sword cane, and may wield the estoc as a
      two-handed martial weapon. Whenever you make an attack using your
      Dexterity bonus on attack rolls and your Strength bonus on melee damage
      rolls, any creature you deal damage to suffers a -1 to CMB when attempting
      to disarm or sunder your weapon, and a -1 to CMD against disarm or sunder
      attempts you make against it. These penalties end at the start of your
      next turn. At +10 base attack bonus, these penalties increase to -2.</p>
