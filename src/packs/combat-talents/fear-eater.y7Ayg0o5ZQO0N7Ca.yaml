      <p>Whenever you successfully damage a creature with an attack action while
      they are demoralized, you can expend your martial focus to gain a number
      of temporary hit points equal to your ranks in Intimidate as a free action
      which last for 1 minute. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate,
      double the amount of temporary hit points this ability provides.</p>
