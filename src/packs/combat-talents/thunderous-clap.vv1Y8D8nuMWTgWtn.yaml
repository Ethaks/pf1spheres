      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brute sphere, base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus as a full-round action to slam your
      palms together, creating a thunderous shockwave that blows down anything
      in its path. Creatures within a close range burst (25 ft. + 5 ft. per 2
      base attack bonus) or a medium- sized cone (100 ft. +10 ft. per base
      attack bonus) suffer 1d8 sonic damage per 2 points of base attack bonus
      you possess (minimum 1d8) and are deafened for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful
      Fortitude save halves this damage and negates the deafened effect.</p>

      <p>In addition, you may make a bull rush at range as a free action that
      does not provoke an attack of opportunity against each target within the
      affected area. You do not move with the targets when bull rushing them in
      this manner, nor is there any size limitation on how large a creature you
      can affect with this ability.</p>

      <p>All nonmagical sources of fire within the affected area are instantly
      extinguished.</p>
