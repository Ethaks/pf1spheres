    value: >
      <p>Whenever you move at least 10 ft. in a round and begin and end your
      turn in cover or concealment, you gain a competence bonus to Stealth
      checks equal to 1/2 your ranks in Stealth (minimum 1) for one round. You
      must end your movement in a different square than the one you started your
      turn to receive this benefit. If you use the Sniper function of the
      Stealth skill, the penalty to Stealth checks is reduced by -10 (to a
      minimum of 0).</p>
