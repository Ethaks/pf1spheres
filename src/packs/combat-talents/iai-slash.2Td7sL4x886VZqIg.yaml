    value: >
      <p>Whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature in the same round you drew
      the weapon used to deal that damage, you may expend any amount of attacks
      of opportunity as a free action to compare the same attack roll against
      the AC (or your maneuver check against their disarm CMD) of a different
      enemy within reach for each attack of opportunity. If your attack roll is
      greater than a creature&#8217;s AC, you quickly strike that creature and
      cause them to suffer from your blooded strike (this does not allow you to
      apply additional (bleed) talents).</p>

      <p>Additionally, whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature already
      suffering from your blooded strike, or an enemy suffering from your
      blooded strike&#8217;s bleed is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, you may
      sheathe your weapon as a free action.</p>
