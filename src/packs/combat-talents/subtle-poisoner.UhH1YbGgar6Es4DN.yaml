    value: >
      <p>Once per round, as part of the same action used to draw a hidden
      weapon, you can apply poison to the weapon. To do so, you must already
      have the poison in hand and must succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check.
      Success means the dose of poison is expended and you poison the weapon
      without drawing attention to your act. Failure means any creatures present
      can immediately attempt opposed Perception checks to notice your poisoning
      attempt.</p>

      <p>If you fail the check by 5 or more, you also expose yourself to the
      poison unless you have an ability that would prevent accidental poisoning,
      such as the (poison) package of the Alchemy sphere, or the poison use
      ability. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Subtle Poisoner</p>
