      <p>You are skilled at crafting and repairing gear. When you first gain
      this ability, you gain ranks in a single Craft skill of your choice equal
      to your total Hit Dice; whenever you gain a Hit Die (such as when you gain
      a level) you gain an additional rank. If you already possess ranks in this
      Craft skill, you may immediately retrain them, but you do not get to
      retrain when only temporarily gaining this talent, such as through the
      armiger&#8217;s customized weapons class feature. When crafting a mundane
      item, you may do so in half the usual time.</p>
