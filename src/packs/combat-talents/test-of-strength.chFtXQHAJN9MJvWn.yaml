    value: >
      <p>Whenever you attempt to initiate a grapple, you can allow the creature
      which you are attempting to grapple to make an opposed grapple check; if
      the creature&#8217;s result is higher than yours, the grapple fails
      regardless of your result. If your result is higher, the grapple is
      successful regardless of your result and the creature provokes an attack
      of opportunity from an ally of your choice. The creature may choose to not
      make an opposed grapple check, in this case, they take a -2 penalty to
      their CMD until the end of their next round.</p>
