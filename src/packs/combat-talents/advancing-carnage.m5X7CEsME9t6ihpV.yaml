    value: >
      <p>Whenever you make a melee attack using the attack action, you may
      choose to take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made that round. If your
      attack hits, you may make an additional attack as a free action against a
      creature that is adjacent to the first and also within your reach. If this
      additional attack hits, you may make another additional attack against a
      new target adjacent to the struck target. You may continue attacking
      targets adjacent to your most recent struck target as long as you still
      have a valid target for this ability, but you cannot attack the same
      creature twice. The number of additional attacks made with this ability
      cannot exceed 1/2 your base attack bonus (minimum 1).</p>

      <p>You can take this talent a second time, allowing you to take a single
      5-ft. step as a free action after making an attack when using this
      ability. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that
      creature becomes a legal target for your additional attack(s) as long as
      it meets all the other prerequisites. Your movement with this talent
      cannot exceed your move speed. <strong>Associated Feats:</strong> Cleave,
      Great Cleave, Cleave Through when taken twice.</p>
