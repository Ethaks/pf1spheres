      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Dual Wielding sphere, base attack bonus
      +5.</p>

      <p>While wielding two weapons, as a standard action you expend your
      martial focus to twirl the two weapons with enough force to create a
      damaging cyclone of air. Each creature within 10 ft. of you takes damage
      equal to your weapon damage for both your primary and one of your off-hand
      attacks. A successful Reflex save reduces this damage by half. For every 5
      additional base attack bonus you possess, you may increase the radius by
      an additional 5 ft.</p>
