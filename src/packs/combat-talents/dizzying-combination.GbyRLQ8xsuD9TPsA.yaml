    value: >
      <p>Whenever you use an attack action and successfully strike a single
      creature with both your main-hand and off-hand weapons before the start of
      your next turn, that creature must make a successful Reflex save or take a
      -2 penalty on Reflex saves and have all movement speeds they possessed
      reduced by 10 ft. (minimum 0 ft.) for 1 minute. At +10 base attack bonus,
      this penalty is doubled. Any action that would remove the battered
      condition also ends this penalty.</p>
