    value: >
      <p>When a creature makes a melee attack against you, you may expend your
      martial focus and use an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that
      attack. Make an attack roll as if you were making an attack of
      opportunity, but for each size category the attacking creature is larger
      than you, you take a &#8211;2 penalty on this roll. If your result is
      greater than the attacking creature&#8217;s result, the creature&#8217;s
      attack automatically misses and you regain your martial focus. If your
      base attack bonus is +5 or greater, you may choose to make a single melee
      attack against a creature whose attack you have successfully parried
      instead of regaining your martial focus.</p>
