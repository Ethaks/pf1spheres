If you do, you are not tripped and remain standing on your feet. This ability can cause a successful trip maneuver to be treated as an unsuccessful one for the purposes of other abilities or effects. If you are flying and use this ability to not fall prone, you instead do not fall.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, if you possess the associated Athletics sphere package, you gain additional abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Catwalk (requires (run) package):</strong> You may always take 10 on Acrobatics checks made to cross narrow or uneven surfaces. In addition, as long as you have martial focus, you always succeed at Acrobatics checks made to not fall prone while moving faster than half your speed across a slippery surface (such as grease or ice) or while blind.</li>\n<li><strong>Soft-Paw Landing (requires (leap) package):</strong> During your turn, whenever you would fall at least 10 feet and suffer no falling damage (such as succeeding at Acrobatics check to soften a fall), you may immediately attempt a Stealth check to hide, and can hide even while you are observed or if you do not have cover or concealment. If this ability is used as part of your movement, you may complete your movement after attempting the Stealth check (such as to reposition into cover, etc.).</li>\n</ul>\n",
