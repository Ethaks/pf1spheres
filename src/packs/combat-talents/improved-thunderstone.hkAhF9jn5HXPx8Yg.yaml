      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>

      <p>You create an alchemical stone that can be used as a ranged attack with
      a range increment of 10 ft. When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck
      hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each
      creature within a 10-ft.-radius spread must make a Fortitude save or be
      deafened for 1 hour. A deafened creature, in addition to the obvious
      effects, takes a &#8211;4 penalty on initiative and has a 20% chance to
      miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to
      cast.</p>

      <p>You can increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; each
      time you do so you increase the duration of this ability by 1 hour, add
      1d6 sonic damage to all creatures within the effect&#8217;s radius
      (creatures who pass their saving throw against this item take half
      damage), and increase the radius of the effect by 10 ft.</p>
