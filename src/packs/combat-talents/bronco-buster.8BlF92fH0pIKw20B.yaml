      <p>As a standard action, you may attempt to mount a creature of the animal
      type within your reach that is of a size suitable to serve you as a mount.
      Make a Ride skill check against the creature&#8217;s CMD. If successful,
      you move into the creature&#8217;s space and it acts as your mount. The
      creature may make a Will save each round to break free of your control. If
      successful, it may attempt to throw you once per round as a move action,
      making a combat maneuver check against a DC of 10 + your Ride skill
      modifier to force you to dismount in an adjacent square of your choice. If
      it fails the Will save, it must act as a willing mount for that turn. A
      new Will save must be made each round until you are thrown or choose to
      dismount.</p>

      <p>Additionally, you may use your ranks in Ride in place of your ranks in
      Handle Animal when making checks to train or rear a creature suitable to
      serve as your mount.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (handle animal) package and the Broad Skills talent,
      you may use this talent on any creature to which your trainer ability
      applies, though creatures not of the animal type gain a +2 bonus on their
      Will save.</p>
