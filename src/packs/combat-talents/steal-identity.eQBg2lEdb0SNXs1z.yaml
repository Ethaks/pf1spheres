      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Scoundrel sphere, Sleight of Hand 3
      ranks.</p>

      <p>When performing a steal combat maneuver, rather than steal an item, you
      may expend your martial focus to harness an understanding of the
      creature&#8217;s appearance and behavior. You gain a +10 bonus on Disguise
      checks to disguise yourself as that creature for 1 hour. This bonus does
      not stack with the benefit to Disguise checks granted by polymorph
      effects. In addition, targets gain half the usual benefit to their
      Perception checks based on familiarity with the target. This is a
      supernatural effect.</p>
