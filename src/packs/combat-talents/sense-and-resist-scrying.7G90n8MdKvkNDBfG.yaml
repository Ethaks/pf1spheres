      <p>You are able to detect and evade the scrying of others. You may use a
      Perception check to detect sensors (such as from the
      clairaudience/clairvoyance spell) as if they were invisible creatures with
      a Stealth check of 20 + the caster level of the effect. As long as you
      have martial focus, you also immediately become aware of any attempt to
      scry on you, such as with a divination (scrying) school spell or the
      Scrying advanced divination talent. If these spells and effects originate
      within 30 ft. of you, you also know their location. As soon as you become
      aware of such an effect, you may force the caster to make a caster level
      check opposed by your Stealth check. If you succeed, the effect becomes
      unable to detect any information about yourself or the area or creatures
      within 30 ft. of you.</p>
