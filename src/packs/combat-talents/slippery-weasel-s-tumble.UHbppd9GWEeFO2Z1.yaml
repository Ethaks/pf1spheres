      <p>You channel the weasel, darting and slipping just out of grasp before
      striking.</p>

      <p>Whenever you succeed at an Acrobatics check to move through an
      opponent&#8217;s threatened area or space without provoking an attack of
      opportunity from that opponent, you may move 5 feet into another space
      inside that opponent&#8217;s natural reach or threatened area. You must
      make this movement using a movement mode corresponding to a package you
      possess. For every 10 ranks in a skill granted by an Athletics package you
      possess, you may move an additional 5 feet when moving with this talent.
      This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity or count against
      your total movement for the turn. You may use this talent to move a number
      of times each round equal to your practitioner modifier.</p>

      <p>Whenever you succeed at an Acrobatics check to move through an
      opponent&#8217;s threatened area or space without provoking an attack of
      opportunity from that opponent, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on attack
      rolls made against that opponent until the start of your next turn. This
      bonus increases by +1 for every 7 ranks in a skill granted by an Athletics
      package you possess. If you moved through multiple opponents&#8217;
      threatened areas, choose one opponent to gain these bonuses against.
