    value: >
      <p>As long as you have martial focus, the number of hit points you can be
      reduced to below 0 without dying is doubled and you may choose to act as
      if you were disabled, rather than dying. You must make this decision as
      soon as you are reduced to negative hit points (even if it isn&#8217;t
      your turn). If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you
      immediately fall unconscious.</p>

      <p>When using this talent, you are staggered. You can take a move action
      without further injuring yourself, but if you perform any standard action
      (or any other action deemed as strenuous, including some swift actions,
      such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after
      completing the act. If your negative hit points are equal to or greater
      than twice your Constitution score, you immediately die.
      <strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Diehard.</p>
