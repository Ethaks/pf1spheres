      <p>Whenever you succeed at a Reflex saving throw against an attack or
      effect that targets or affects multiple squares, you may make a Stealth
      check to hide even if you do not have cover or concealment. Your Stealth
      automatically ends if you do not enter cover or concealment, or succeed at
      a Reflex saving throw against another area effect, by the end of your next
      turn.</p>
