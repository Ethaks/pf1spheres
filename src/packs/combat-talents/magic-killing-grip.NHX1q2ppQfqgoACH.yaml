      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Wrestling sphere, base attack bonus
      +10.</p>

      <p>Treat the result of your grapple check as a dispel check against the
      target of your grapple as though you were making a targeted dispel with
      dispel magic (compare your grapple check to the effect on the target with
      the highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell&#8217;s caster level). If
      successful, that effect ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell
      with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have
      dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel
      every spell). If you grapple a summoned creature, this can end the spell
      that summoned them.</p>
