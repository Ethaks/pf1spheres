      <p>You are no stranger to the elements you walk through. Each time you use
      this adrenaline, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain
      energy resistance equal to 5 + 1/2 your base attack bonus against the
      chosen energy type. This energy resistance stacks with other forms of
      energy resistance. If you expend your martial focus when you start
      berserking using this talent, increase the energy resistance granted to 10
      + your base attack bonus.</p>

      <p>Whenever the energy resistance granted by this (adrenaline) would
      prevent or reduce energy damage you take, you may spend an immediate
      action to regain martial focus.</p>
