      <p>If you possess the (challenge) package, any time a creature under the
      effects of your challenge attacks an ally within Close range of you (25 ft
      + 5 ft. per 2 base attack bonus), that attack suffers a 20% miss
      chance.</p>

      <p>If you possess the (patrol) package, allies within the area of your
      patrol, not including yourself, gain a 20% miss chance against melee
      attacks originating from a creature that you threaten.</p>

      <p>If an attack would be subject to both miss chances, the miss chance
      increases to 50%.</p>
