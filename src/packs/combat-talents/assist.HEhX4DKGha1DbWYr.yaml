    value: >
      <p>When an ally within the area of your patrol makes an attack, is
      targeted by an attack, or attempts a saving throw, you may spend an attack
      of opportunity to move to put that ally within reach (with the normal
      limits for moving as part of your patrol) and use the aid another action
      to improve that ally&#8217;s attack roll, AC, or saving throw as
      appropriate to the triggering action. <strong>Associated Feat:</strong>
      Bodyguard.</p>
