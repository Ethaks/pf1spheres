      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Athletics sphere, Diving Strike, either
      Shatter Earth from the Berserker sphere or Earthquake Stomp from the Brute
      sphere, base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>When using Diving Strike, you may treat the attack granted at the end
      of the charge as a valid attack to use either Shatter Earth or a valid
      action to perform an Earthquake Stomp, and may target the ground in place
      of a creature when cushioning your fall, and are always considered to have
      made a successful attack.</p>

      <p>In addition, the size of the effect increases depending on how much
      falling damage you inflict to the floor. Radius effects increase by 5 ft.
      per 2d6, cones increase by 5 ft. per 1d6, and lines increase by 10 ft. per
      1d6.</p>
