    value: >
      <p>Whenever you make an attack action with a bow, you can load two arrows
      and fire them as part of the same attack. When making an attack action in
      this fashion, your attack suffers a -2 penalty, but can target two
      adjacent creatures. For every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess,
      the targets may be +5 ft. away from each other and still be viable
      targets, so long as their distance from each other is not greater than the
      distance from you to either of them. If combined with a barrage, only the
      actual attack action is split, not the extra attacks.</p>
