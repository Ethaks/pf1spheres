      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Open Hand sphere, base attack bonus
      +10.</p>

      <p>When you make an attack action with an unarmed strike, you can expend
      your martial focus as a free action as a part of the attack. If you do,
      until the end of your turn, whenever you deal damage with an unarmed
      strike, your opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain 1 permanent
      negative level (you can only bestow a number of negative levels to a
      creature with this talent equal to 1/2 your practitioner modifier). At
      base attack bonus +20, they must succeed at two Fortitude saves instead of
      one to resist the permanent negative level.</p>
