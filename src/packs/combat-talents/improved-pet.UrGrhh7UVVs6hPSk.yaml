      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Beastmastery sphere; Beastmastery
      sphere (Pet) or ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible alignment,
      sufficiently high level (see details).</p>

      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> You may grant your familiar all the normal
      benefits of being a familiar, as the wizard&#8217;s arcane bond option
      (including type, Intelligence bonus, and special abilities), but doing so
      incurs the normal replacement cost should your familiar die. In addition,
      when choosing a familiar, you may choose from the creatures available
      through the Improved Familiar feat (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Your
      effective arcane spellcaster level must be sufficiently high enough to
      choose a familiar with this talent. You may choose a familiar up to one
      step away on each alignment axis (lawful through chaotic, good through
      evil).</p>

      <p>An improved familiar is otherwise treated as a regular familiar and
      always counts as an animal ally, with two exceptions: if the
      creature&#8217;s type is something other than animal, its type does not
      change to magical beast, and improved familiars do not gain the ability to
      speak with other creatures of their kind (although many of them already
      have the ability to communicate).</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Improved Familiar.</p>
