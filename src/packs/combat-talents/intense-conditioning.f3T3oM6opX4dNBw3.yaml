      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Boxing sphere, counter punch ability,
      base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>Whenever you land a successful counter punch, you may expend your
      martial focus as a free action to make the creature damaged by your
      counter punch make a Will save; if this save is unsuccessful, for 1
      minute, whenever the creature attempts the action which triggered your
      counter punch, they must make a successful Will save or lose that action.
      This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>
