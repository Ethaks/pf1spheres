    value: >
      <p>All allies that start their turn within the radius of this tactic gain
      a +5 ft enhancement bonus to their base land speed. An ally who begins or
      ends their turn outside of this tactic&#8217;s affected area loses its
      benefits until they once more start their turn within its radius. For
      every 5 ranks in Diplomacy you possess, this enhancement bonus is
      increased by an additional 5 ft.</p>

      <p><strong>Addendum [Conq. HB]:</strong> You may take this talent twice.
      If taken a second time, instead of granting an enhancement bonus to base
      land speed, you may allow allies benefiting from this tactic to move
      through 5 feet of difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain,
      increasing by 5 feet for every 10 ranks of Diplomacy you possess, and
      allows allies to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain.</p>

      <p><strong>Associated Feat:</strong> Nimble Moves (if taken twice).</p>
