      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Fencing sphere, base attack bonus
      +5.</p>

      <p>As long as you have martial focus, when you strike an opponent that has
      a chance of negating critical hits or precision damage, such as from the
      fortification armor special ability, reduce that chance by 5% per point of
      base attack bonus you possess.</p>

      <p>When you use this effect, you may expend martial focus to treat
      creatures that are normally immune to critical hits and precision damage
      as having a 150% chance to negate the critical hit or precision damage,
      reduced as normal by this talent&#8217;s effect. Treat creatures with a
      100% fortification chance or greater as if they were immune to critical
      hits and precision damage (thus having an effective 150% chance to negate
      such effects) for the purposes of this talent. <strong>Associated
      Feat:</strong> Anatomical Savant.</p>
