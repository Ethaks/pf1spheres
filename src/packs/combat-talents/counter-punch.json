For every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess, this bonus increases by +2. Using this ability does not change your place in the initiative order.</p>\n<p>You can apply a single talent with the (counter) tag to a counter punch.</p>\n<p>Whenever you ready a counter punch, you can decide on an additional trigger for your prepared attack from the following list; if the trigger is met, the readied attack qualifies as a counter punch (if an action would also provoke an attack of opportunity, you may choose in which order you wish to resolve your attacks):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A hostile creature making an attack roll, other than as part of a combat maneuver</li>\n<li>A hostile creature attempting a combat maneuver</li>\n<li>A hostile creature moving from their square</li>\n<li>A hostile creature using a spell or a spell-like ability</li>\n<li>A hostile creature drawing a weapon</li>\n<li>A hostile creature speaking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For every 5 points of base attack bonus you possess, you may select an additional trigger from this list.</p>\n",
