    value: >
      <p>When a creature affected by your challenge is reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points, you may issue a challenge to a creature you can see as a free
      action (even if it is not your turn). A creature challenged this way gains
      an additional +2 bonus on attack rolls against you until the end of its
      next turn.</p>

      <p>If you have Mass Challenge, challenging a creature this way does not
      end your challenge on any other creatures.</p>
