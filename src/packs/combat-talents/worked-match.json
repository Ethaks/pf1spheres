      "value": "<p>If you are adjacent to a willing ally, you may make an Intimidate check as a full-round action against all hostile creatures watching you to influence their attitude, using dangerous looking moves against your ally while not dealing any actual damage to them. You gain a +2 to this Intimidate check for every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess. Creatures who have their attitude shifted by this talent have their attitude reverted to neutral rather than unfriendly, and any creature whose attitude is shifted by this talent takes a -2 penalty to saving throws against fear effects which originate from you for 1 day.</p>\n<p>You can also use a grapple check with a willing ally as a Perform check for the purposes of making money gaining a +2 bonus for every 4 points of base attack bonus you possess (this is treated as a performance check for bonuses that would apply to making performance checks).</p>\n<p>Each willing ally who participates in this talent for either use of it gives you an additional +2 bonus on this check (up to 5 additional allies), allowing you to further demonstrate your grappling prowess.</p>\n<p>Those observing you using this talent can make a Perception check with a DC of 10 + your grapple check to see that it is fake, which shifts their attitude 1 step closer towards hostile towards you and any ally who participated in this talent.</p>\n",
