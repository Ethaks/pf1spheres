    value: >
      <p>Creature damaged by your brutal strike must succeed on a Fortitude save
      or be staggered for 1 round plus 1 round per 4 base attack bonus. If the
      target is battered, it is instead staggered for 1 round on a successful
      save, or dazed for 1 round then staggered as normal on a failed save. If
      the target failed the Fortitude save, for the duration of the staggered
      condition, it also counts the damage from the attack as ongoing damage for
      the purpose of concentration checks. Creatures immune to the dazed
      condition are instead staggered for the round they would have been
      dazed.</p>
