    value: >
      <p>Whenever you attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize any number of
      creatures, your terrifying display causes creatures that have been
      successfully demoralized to begin screaming until the end of their next
      turn. Creatures who are screaming automatically allow any creature who can
      hear them to pinpoint their exact location without a Perception check,
      even if they are otherwise invisible. Additionally, this causes any
      screaming to break their stealth if they were actively stealthing. This
      does not negate any bonuses granted from invisibility (although it does
      allow creatures to pinpoint them) or any concealment the creature might
      have.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus when utilizing this talent to
      increase the duration by 1d4 rounds, plus an additional round for every 5
      ranks in Intimidate that you possess. If you have at least 10 ranks in
      Intimidate, when expending martial focus with this ability creatures who
      are screaming no longer benefit from any bonuses from being difficult or
      impossible to see (such as invisibility). This includes any bonuses to
      attacks they might have, concealment, and any such similar bonus as long
      as it is granted due to vision of the creature being obscured.</p>
