      "value": "<p>When triggered, this trap erects a distracting, scratchable pole which occupies the nearest unoccupied square to the triggering square. The scratching post is an object which remains in that square for 1 minute per rank of Craft (traps) you possess and the square it occupies is treated as difficult terrain. The creature which triggered this trap must immediately attempt a saving throw or suffer the scratching post&#8217;s penalties.</p>\n<p>Whenever an enemy within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 ranks of Craft (traps) you possess) who can see the scratching post makes an attack roll that does not include the scratching post, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or take a penalty on all attack rolls they make until the start of their next turn equal to -2 - 1 per 5 ranks in Craft (traps). If the creature successfully saves against the scratching post&#8217;s effect, they are immune until the start of their next turn. If there are multiple scratching posts, a creature only needs to succeed at a single saving throw to resist their allure (against the highest DC).</p>\n<p><strong>Scratching Post</strong><br>\nThe scratching post is a wooden object approximately 3 to 5 feet tall with the following statistics:<br>\n<strong>Hit Points</strong> 5 + 3 per rank in Craft (traps)<br>\n<strong>AC</strong> 5 + 1 per rank in Craft (traps)<br>\n<strong>CMD</strong> 15 + 1 per rank in Craft (traps)<br>\n<strong>Hardness</strong> 5<br>\nAs an object, the scratching post cannot succeed at saving throws and can otherwise be interacted with as a normal object. However, the scratching post is firmly grounded and difficult to move. The materials it is constructed from are scavenged and temporary, and cannot be salvaged from a broken trap or after the trap&#8217;s duration expires.</p>\n",
