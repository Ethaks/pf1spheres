      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (cohort) package,
      Diplomacy 5 ranks.</p>

      <p>You may recruit intelligent (Int greater than 2) creatures of any type
      into your service, though creatures of a different type impose a +10
      increase to their recruit DC. Creatures so recruited use their normal
      statistics and equipment.</p>

      <p>Unlike normal cohorts, advanced cohorts that are not of normal player
      races are unlikely to be found in settlements, though may be encountered
      over the course of the campaign; finding a particular creature may require
      a seperate adventure to seek out and ally yourself with them. Monstrous
      creatures often have very different perspectives and goals than common
      adventurers, so may be even more likely to have the cohort relationship be
      transitory.</p>

      <p>Creatures recruited with this talent cannot have a CR greater than half
      your ranks in Diplomacy (round down as usual). Use the minimum required
      Diplomacy ranks to recruit such a creature in place of its Hit Dice for
      determining the number of Hit Dice required from your Hit Dice pool.
      Advanced cohorts start with whatever gear is appropriate per their
      creature entry or situation. As usual, the cohort must be compensated for
      any equipment that is lost. Equipment you provide to an advanced cohort is
      not factored into their CR calculation.</p>

      <p>Creatures that advance by class levels may advance as a cohort, using
      cohort professions, whenever a cohort would normally be allowed to gain
      Hit Dice. Otherwise, they may advance by class, using their new CR to
      determine equivalent Hit Dice. Treat such a creature&#8217;s Hit Dice as
      equal to its CR x 2 + the number of cohort Hit Dice added to it for the
      purpose of determining the number of Hit Dice required from your Hit Dice
      pool.</p>

      <p>Creatures that advance by Hit Dice may do so whenever the cohort would
      normally be allowed to advance, but cannot exceed the normal limits on
      effective Hit Dice. Intelligent creatures that you create, such as via the
      Bestow Life advanced talent of the Enhancement sphere or the Greater
      Undead advanced talent of the Death sphere, are usually willing to serve
      as advanced cohorts, removing the +10 DC increase for having a different
      type.</p>
