    value: >
      <p>When a creature affected by your challenge is reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points or you succeed on a combat maneuver check made on an attack of
      opportunity while you have a patrol set up, you may regain martial focus
      as an immediate action.</p>

      <p>If you posses the Defend Other talent, you may regain focus on your
      next turn whenever an enemy misses an ally benefiting from that talent
      with an attack.</p>
