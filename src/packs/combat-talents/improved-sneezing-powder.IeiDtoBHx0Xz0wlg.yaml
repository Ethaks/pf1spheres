      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>

      <p>You create a single use bag of coarse yellowish-red powder that can be
      used as a range touch attack with a range increment of 10 ft. Anyone
      standing in the square of impact or an adjacent squares must make
      Fortitude saves; creatures within 10 ft. of the point of impact must also
      make Fortitude saves, but gain a +5 competence bonus on the save.
      Creatures who fail their initial save are staggered for 1 round as they
      succumb to uncontrollable sneezing, and must make a Fortitude save each
      round for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter or continue to be staggered.</p>

      <p>A successful save ends the effect. This is a poison effect. You can
      increase the Craft DC for this item in increments of 10; each time you do
      so, the area of effect improves by 5 ft., and all saving throw DCs
      increase by +2.</p>
