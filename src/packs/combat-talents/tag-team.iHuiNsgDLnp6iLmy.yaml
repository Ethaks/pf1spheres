      <p>You force the target of your grapple to provoke an attack of
      opportunity from one other ally threatening the target with a +2
      circumstance bonus on their attack roll, breaking your grapple. If the
      target takes damage from the attack of opportunity, you regain martial
      focus and may move up to 10 feet. This movement does not provoke an attack
      of opportunity.</p>
