      <p>As a move action, you may move up to half your speed and make a melee
      touch attack against a creature. If successful, the target takes
      bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier (or whichever attribute
      was used to make the check) and gains the battered condition until the end
      of your next turn. You may perform a shove in place of the attack granted
      by a charge, although this does not grant the extra movement.</p>

      <p><strong>Manhandle:</strong> When you successfully perform a bull rush,
      drag, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver (assuming the target decided
      to block you and did not simply move out of the way), you may apply the
      effect of one (manhandle) talent you know to that creature. (Manhandle)
      talents cannot be applied to maneuvers performed as a free action.</p>

      <p><em>Author's Note:</em> Shove is a unique "armed attack" that when
      augmented with a talent that allows you to "use a weapon" (e.g. Brace
      Weapon, Slapper) will only inherit specific properties from that weapon.
      The Brace Weapon and Slapper talents add bonuses to hit and/or damage and
      certain damaging effects (such as a flaming or holy special weapon
      ability) but do not treat a shove attack as an attack with that weapon for
      other effects (such as a spell-storing weapon, the grab or trip universal
      monster rules, the Bashing Finish feat, or other "when you make a
      successful attack"-type effects).</p>
