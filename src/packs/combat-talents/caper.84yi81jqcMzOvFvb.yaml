    value: >
      <p>Your extravagant and unusual display confounds your foes. Until the
      start of your next turn, any creature within range of this boast that
      attempts to target you with an attack roll must make a Will save or lose
      their attack, though if making a full attack may still direct any
      remaining attacks toward other targets. If they targeted you with a spell,
      the spell or the portion of the spell targeting you is lost. Once a
      creature succeeds on a Will save against this ability, it is immune to
      your use of it for 24 hrs.</p>
