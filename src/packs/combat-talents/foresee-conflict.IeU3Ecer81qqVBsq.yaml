      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Intimidate 5 ranks, Gladiator sphere
      (Duel Of Wills).</p>

      <p>Whenever a creature fails a save against your Duel Of Wills talent in
      combat, the GM pre-rolls the attack roll of the first attack that creature
      would make against you in the current combat and shows you the result of
      the d20. At 10 ranks in Intimidate and every 5 additional ranks, the GM
      pre-rolls the next attack the creature would make against you.</p>
