      <p>When used as a dart, the target must make a Reflex save or suffer a 20%
      miss chance on all attack rolls for 1 round and dazzled for a number of
      rounds equal to your ranks in Craft (traps). At 10 ranks in Craft (traps),
      it may inflict the blinded condition rather than a miss chance.</p>

      <p>When used as a snare, all creatures within 5 ft. of a corner of the
      triggering square of your choice must make a Reflex save or be blinded for
      1 round and dazzled for a number of rounds equal to your ranks in Craft
      (traps). For every 5 ranks in Craft (traps) you possess, the area of this
      snare increases by 5 ft. If you possess 10 or more ranks in Craft (traps),
      the duration of the blinded condition also increases by 1 round.</p>
