      <p>When moving down an incline or using the charge action, you may spend a
      swift action to throw your shield down in front of you and use it to skate
      across the ground. This gives you a 10 ft. circumstance bonus to your land
      speed for that round. You do not benefit from your shield bonus to AC
      during your movement while using this ability. You may reclaim and reequip
      your shield as a free action at the end of your movement.</p>

      <p>For every 5 points of base attack bonus you possess, the circumstance
      bonus to your land speed increases by 10 ft. You may make overrun attempts
      against any creature in the path of this movement without provoking
      attacks of opportunity. Add your shield bonus to AC to your combat
      maneuver bonus for these checks.</p>
