      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Diplomacy 5 ranks, Warleader
      sphere.</p>

      <p>You may release a shout that causes nearby metal weapons to suddenly
      resonate with sound. For the shout&#8217;s duration, you and your affected
      allies&#8217; weapon attacks made with metal weapons deal an additional
      1d6 points of sonic damage. This damage increases by 1d6 at 10 ranks in
      Diplomacy and every 5 ranks beyond.</p>

      <p>You may expend your martial focus when using this shout to allow the
      shout to benefit all kinds of weapons. Additionally, at 10 ranks in
      Diplomacy, the damage die size is also increased to d8s instead of
      d6s.</p>
