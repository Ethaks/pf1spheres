      <p>You consider any beverage, alcoholic or not, to be an alcoholic
      beverage. This means that even water can potentially cause you to become
      drunk, and that potions, extracts and even alchemy formulae can grant you
      the drunk status, and that they may potentially sicken you from drinking
      too many.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, when drinking an alcoholic drink, you can consider it to
      be nonalcoholic. This allows you to drink as many alcoholic drinks as you
      desire without gaining the drunk status nor contributing to how many
      alcoholic drinks you have had before gaining the sickened condition.</p>

      <p>You choose whether or not to consider a drink as alcoholic or not
      alcoholic at the time of drinking.</p>
