      <p>You gain proficiency with the blade boot, brass knuckles, cestus, dan
      bong, emei piercer, gauntlet, katar, knuckle axe, punching dagger, rope
      gauntlet, sap, scizore, spiked gauntlet, and tekko-kagi, and may treat
      these and any natural attacks you possess (except when using them as part
      of a full attack) as an unarmed strike for the purpose of how much damage
      they deal and interactions with abilities which require an unarmed strike;
      when using any of these weapons as an unarmed strike, it uses your unarmed
      strike&#8217;s critical multiplier, even if it would normally be
      higher.</p>
