      <p>You treat garrotes as possessing the finesse weapon special feature. As
      an attack action, you may make a grapple check to initiate a grapple using
      a garrote against any target within reach, not just helpless or unaware
      targets. If successful, you deal your garrote damage to the target. You do
      not take the -4 penalty for not having two hands free on this check. When
      you use the choke option when making a grapple check, you may inflict
      garrote damage in addition to the effects of the choke. The garrote damage
      referenced in this ability includes your Strength modifier as appropriate
      to a two handed weapon as well as any enhancement and other bonuses.
      Damage from this talent does not stack with damage from the constrict
      universal monster ability.</p>
