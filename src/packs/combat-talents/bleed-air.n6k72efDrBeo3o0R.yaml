      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Duelist sphere, base attack bonus
      +10.</p>

      <p>Whenever you deal bleed damage to a creature who is already taking
      bleed damage, you are able to twist your blade to puncture a lung or
      similar organ, causing the target to begin suffocating 1d4 rounds later
      unless they succeed on a Fortitude save. Once the suffocation begins, in
      the first round, the target falls unconscious (0 hit points). In the
      following round, they drop to &#8211;1 hit points and are dying. In the
      third round, they suffocate and die. The target may make a Fortitude save
      each round to stave off advancing to the next stage, but they continue to
      make saving throws each round until they die or until the condition
      ends.</p>

      <p>If the target receives at least 5 hit points of healing at any point
      before they suffocate, the suffocation effect ends and they resume
      breathing as normal. The suffocation effect can also be ended as a
      full-round action by a Heal check with a DC equal to your normal DC for
      combat sphere effects. Creatures who do not need to breathe are immune to
      this effect. If a practitioner uses Bleed Air against a creature that is
      currently suffocating, they are automatically moved 1 round closer to
      suffocation.</p>
