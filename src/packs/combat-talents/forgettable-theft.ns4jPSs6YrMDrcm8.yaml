    value: >
      <p>Whenever you successfully steal an object from an opponent with the
      steal combat maneuver, the opponent must make a successful Will saving
      throw or forget that they owned the stolen object for 1 minute. If the
      opponent is presented with evidence of their previous ownership of the
      object (such as the object having their name on it or being reminded of
      their ownership), they immediately gain an additional saving throw. When
      you have at least 10 ranks in Sleight of Hand, this effect instead lasts
      for 1 hour, and the creature must make an additional saving throw at the
      end of its duration or completely forget that they owned the stolen
      object.</p>
