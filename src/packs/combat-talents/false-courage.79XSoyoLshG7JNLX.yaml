      <p>You ignore all fear effects from which you are currently suffering
      until the beginning of your next turn. At the beginning of your next turn,
      you can make a Will saving throw against one fear effect from which you
      are currently suffering (if a fear effect from which you are currently
      suffering does not have a DC, its DC is treated as 10 + the source&#8217;s
      CR), ending that effect on a successful save.</p>
