      "value": "<p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 15</p>\n<p>Cherry bombs are alchemical bombs that make up for their lack of power with volume and easy maintenance. Crafting a cluster of cherry bombs counts as crafting a single alchemical formulae when determining the total number of formulae you can craft at a time and the total number you may have crafted at once. A cluster of cherry bombs has a number of bombs in it equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 3). Cherry bombs are a splash weapon you can use as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage + 1d4 per 3 Craft (alchemy) ranks you possess to the target of a direct hit, and 1 point of bludgeoning splash damage per die of damage this weapon deals on a direct hit to targets 5 feet away from the point of contact (to a maximum of half the damage dealt to the primary target).</p>\n<p>An individual cherry bomb cannot be split apart from its cluster for more than 1 round without becoming inert. An individual cherry bomb may be modified (such as by being placed into a vial arrow) without being split from its cluster. An entire cluster of cherry bombs is required to make a coating if used with the Chemical Coating talent.</p>\n<p>If you can create formulae that inflict different types of damage (such as an alchemist&#8217;s fire dealing fire damage) when you create the cherry bombs you may have it deal that kind of damage instead. The damage can only be of one damage type at a time, but each separate bomb can deal a different type of damage. You can increase the Craft DC for this weapon in increments of 10; each time you do so, the Reflex save DC to avoid the splash damage increases by +1.</p>\n",
