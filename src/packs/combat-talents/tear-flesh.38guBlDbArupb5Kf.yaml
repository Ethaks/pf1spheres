    value: >
      <p>You may deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage with your
      unarmed strikes, rather than only bludgeoning damage, chosen each time you
      make an unarmed attack. Whenever you deal unarmed strike damage to a
      target as an attack action, you may spend a swift action to rip the
      damaged creature&#8217;s flesh; the creature takes 1 bleed damage and has
      their natural armor reduced by 1 (minimum 0) for as long as they are
      suffering this bleed damage. For every 6 base attack bonus you possess,
      the bleed damage and natural armor reduction caused by this talent
      increase by 1.</p>
