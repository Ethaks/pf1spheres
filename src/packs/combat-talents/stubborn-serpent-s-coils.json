      "value": "<p>You channel the serpent, improving your tenacity and grip.</p>\n<p>You gain the following abilities which can be used while grappling:</p>\n<p><strong>When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From You:</strong> While you are grappling another creature, any effect which would move your grappled target out of your reach must also succeed against you and your relevant statistic (CMD, saving throw, ability check, etc.) or fail to move the grappled target.</p>\n<p><strong>When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:</strong> If an effect would move you away from your grappled target, you may attempt a grapple combat maneuver against your grappled target&#8217;s CMD as an immediate action. If the target is battered, you may spend an attack of opportunity in place of an immediate action instead. If you are successful, the grappled target is moved into the nearest unoccupied and safe space within your reach and remains grappled. A grappled target being moved this way does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>If there is no unoccupied, safe space within your reach when attempting to move your grappled target with you, the target is moved into the nearest unoccupied, safe space near your new location, is released from your grapple, and is staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your practitioner modifier (minimum 1 round).</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> The abilities granted by Stubborn Serpent&#8217;s Coils do not function against Warp sphere effects or other teleportation effects. If you possess the Inescapable Grasp talent, you may use the abilities granted by this talent against teleportation or Warp effects originating from a source other than your grappled target which would move your grappled target out of your grapple.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When Your Grappled Target Is Being Moved Away From You:</strong> You are granted a saving throw or other appropriate check to negate a teleportation effect which would move your grappled target out of your grapple, as described in this ability.</li>\n<li><strong>When You Are Being Moved Away From Your Grappled Target:</strong> You may include your grappled target in a teleport effect that would move you. If your grappled target is unwilling, the teleportation effect must be able to target an unwilling creature and the creature receives a saving throw against the effect, otherwise the grappled target is not moved with you and your grapple ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Grappling is a complex and often confusing combat maneuver. Two examples are included with this talent to help better demonstrate how this talent is used.</p>\n<p><em>If your grappled target is being moved away from you:</em> A creature which uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push your grappled target away from you must also succeed against your CMD while grappling. A Wind severity effect would fail to push your grappled target if the Wind severity effect fails to push you. If a Telekinesis sphere effect would attempt to lift and move your grappled target out of your reach, the Telekinesis sphere caster would treat this as contested control over an item.</p>\n<p><em>If you are being moved away from your grappled target:</em> If a creature uses the bull rush combat maneuver to push you away from your grappled target, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver as an immediate action (or as an attack of opportunity if the target is battered) against your grappled target. If you are successful, the grappled target also moves into an unoccupied, safe space within your reach and your grapple would not end.</p>\n",
