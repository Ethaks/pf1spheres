      "value": "<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Leadership sphere, (cohort) package, Diplomacy 5 ranks.</p>\n<p>You may recruit intelligent (Int greater than 2) creatures of any type into your service, though creatures of a different type impose a +10 increase to their recruit DC. Creatures so recruited use their normal statistics and equipment.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal cohorts, advanced cohorts that are not of normal player races are unlikely to be found in settlements, though may be encountered over the course of the campaign; finding a particular creature may require a seperate adventure to seek out and ally yourself with them. Monstrous creatures often have very different perspectives and goals than common adventurers, so may be even more likely to have the cohort relationship be transitory.</p>\n<p>Creatures recruited with this talent cannot have a CR greater than half your ranks in Diplomacy (round down as usual). Use the minimum required Diplomacy ranks to recruit such a creature in place of its Hit Dice for determining the number of Hit Dice required from your Hit Dice pool. Advanced cohorts start with whatever gear is appropriate per their creature entry or situation. As usual, the cohort must be compensated for any equipment that is lost. Equipment you provide to an advanced cohort is not factored into their CR calculation.</p>\n<p>Creatures that advance by class levels may advance as a cohort, using cohort professions, whenever a cohort would normally be allowed to gain Hit Dice. Otherwise, they may advance by class, using their new CR to determine equivalent Hit Dice. Treat such a creature&#8217;s Hit Dice as equal to its CR x 2 + the number of cohort Hit Dice added to it for the purpose of determining the number of Hit Dice required from your Hit Dice pool.</p>\n<p>Creatures that advance by Hit Dice may do so whenever the cohort would normally be allowed to advance, but cannot exceed the normal limits on effective Hit Dice. Intelligent creatures that you create, such as via the Bestow Life advanced talent of the Enhancement sphere or the Greater Undead advanced talent of the Death sphere, are usually willing to serve as advanced cohorts, removing the +10 DC increase for having a different type.</p>\n",
