    value: >
      <p>Whenever you attack a target that has lost its Dexterity bonus to its
      armor class due to your successful feint, your critical threat range for
      that attack is doubled. If you possess the Expert Feint talent, this
      doubling applies to all attacks against the target while it is suffering
      the effects of your feint. This does not stack with other effects that
      extend the threat range of a weapon.</p>
