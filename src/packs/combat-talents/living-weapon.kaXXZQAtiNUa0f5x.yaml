    value: >
      <p>If the target of your grapple has been pinned and is no larger than you
      are, you may wield the creature as if they were a melee weapon you are
      proficient with until the end of your next turn, or until they
      successfully break your grapple, whichever comes first. If you do not
      spend the necessary action to maintain the grapple on your next turn, the
      grapple ends with your turn. You may make a single attack action with the
      grappled creature in place of the options normally available when
      maintaining a grapple.</p>

      <p>Creatures wielded in this manner use the improvised weapon charts when
      determining their damage and required hands and difficulty of use, and 1/2
      of any damage dealt with the wielded creature is dealt to the wielded
      creature itself. If you possess the Shoulder Throw talent, you may use the
      wielded creature as a thrown weapon, to a maximum range as outlined in the
      Shoulder Throw talent. If the pinned opponent is unable to resist being
      pinned for any reason, you can use that opponent as a weapon without
      grappling or pinning them, until the creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit
      points, at which point the creature cannot be grappled and only counts as
      an improvised weapon.</p>
