      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Brute sphere, base attack bonus +5.</p>

      <p>Whenever you successfully perform a bull rush, drag, overrun or
      reposition maneuver against a creature, you may have them become
      immaterial for a brief, unreliable moment. The creature&#8217;s movement
      made as part of the successful maneuver is not interrupted by any
      creatures or objects within its path, and shifts harmlessly through them
      as if they were ethereal (and is affected by force and abjuration effects
      as normal). This is a supernatural effect.</p>

      <p>At base attack bonus +10, this may also force creatures within walls
      and solid objects (including creatures). If the successful maneuver would
      result in the creature being within a solid body, the creature is shunted
      to the nearest open space on a suitable surface (chosen at random if there
      are multiple valid spaces), suffering 1d6 damage for every 5 feet traveled
      (maximum 1d6 per point of base attack bonus you possess).</p>
