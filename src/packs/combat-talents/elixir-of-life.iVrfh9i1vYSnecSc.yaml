      <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Alchemy sphere, Craft (alchemy) 5
      ranks.</p>

      <p><strong>Craft DC:</strong> 25</p>

      <p>You create an elixir that can be used as a standard action to restore a
      dead target within your natural reach back to life. As long as the target
      has not been dead for longer than 1 round, the creature is healed to 1 hit
      point, and gains a temporary negative level. You can increase the Craft DC
      for this formulae in increments of 10; each time you do so this formulae
      can target dead creatures that have been dead for 1 additional round, and
      gain 1 additional hit point per Hit Die the creature possesses when
      revived.</p>
