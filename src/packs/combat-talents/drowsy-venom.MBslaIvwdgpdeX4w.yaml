      <p>Creatures who fail two consecutive saving throws against your poison
      are exhausted instead of fatigued. Creatures who fail three consecutive
      saving throws lose consciousness and fall asleep. Slapping or wounding
      awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a
      creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another
      action).</p>
