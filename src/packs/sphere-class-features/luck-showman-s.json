      "value": "<p>The technician knows how to use showmanship to his advantage. His luck pool increases by 1 point, and he gains the following abilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manipulative (Ex):</strong> Whenever the technician makes a Bluff check or Sense Motive check, he may spend 1 point of luck to roll the dice twice and take the better result. He must choose to use this ability before the dice are rolled.</li>\n<li><strong>Lucky Distraction (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, the technician may make a Bluff check to make a distraction opposed by the Sense Motive skill of all creatures within 30 ft. All creatures who fail this check do not see him, allowing him to hide from them via the Stealth skill. In addition, all creatures who fail this check are considered to have been successfully feinted, losing their Dexterity bonus vs. his next attack, as well as any other benefits associated with his feint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A technician must possess the luck technical insight to gain this insight.</p>\n",
