      "value": "<p>The mandrake root is feared in myth and legend for its ability to rend the life from mortals with its banshee-like wail. The scholar knows that while much of this is simply myth, the root does contain certain properties that gave rise to the legends. By ingesting a small portion of ground mandrake root mixed with various catalyzing agents, the scholar is able to unleash a piercing scream that deals an amount of sonic damage equal to 1d4 per class level to all creatures within a 30 ft. radius (Fortitude save for half). This ability affects objects and undead. The scholar herself is immune to the damage from this effect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sonic Shriekers [explosive]:</strong> Scholars with the howling herbology material imposition may enhance their flashbangs with mandrake root, granting them thunderous power. In addition to the flashbang&#8217;s normal effects, the target also takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per class level the scholar possesses, and the DC for Fortitude saves against flashbangs modified with this imposition increases by 1, +1 for every 5 class levels the scholar possesses. Creatures who succeed on their Fortitude save against the flashbang take 1/2 damage from this effect. The damage and effects from this ability apply to objects and undead.</li>\n</ul>\n",
