      "value": "<p><strong>Mighty Flex (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, whenever a conscript successfully executes a bull rush, drag, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver while he has martial focus, he may attempt a grapple or trip combat maneuver as an attack of opportunity (this attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity itself). The conscript cannot attempt a grapple check in this manner unless the opponent is within his natural reach (for example, if the conscript triggered this ability by making a bull rush attempt against a target he chose not to move with, he could only use the trip option of this ability).</p>\n<p><strong>Never Outmatched (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, the conscript ignores the size bonus to a creature&#8217;s combat maneuver bonus and CMD when performing or resisting a bull rush, drag, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver.</p>\n<p><strong>Giant Physique (Ex):</strong> When the conscript reaches 20th level, he gains a +4 bonus to his CMB and CMD when performing or defending against a bull rush, pull, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver. In addition, the conscript doubles his critical threat range when performing a shove or a bull rush, pull, reposition, or overrun combat maneuver that deals damage.</p>\n<p><em>Author's Note:</em> Combat Maneuvers cannot critically hit normally (they \"succeed\" on a natural 20). The Giant Physique ability allows them to critically hit on a natural 20 (doubled to 19-20 by the ability), rolling to confirm the critical hit against the target's CMD. The critical threat range of a combat maneuver augmented with this ability is 20 and multiplier is x2. If you possess an ability that allows you to use a weapon to perform the action or maneuver, you may use that weapon's critical threat range and multiplier instead.</p>\n",
