      "value": "<p><strong>Chemical Specialization (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, whenever the conscript throws an alchemical splash weapon and misses, he may select the square in which the splash weapon lands rather than rolling. Whenever an alchemical item created by the conscript would heal a creature&#8217;s hit points, any healing in excess of the creature&#8217;s maximum hit points is applied as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour per conscript class level.</p>\n<p>In addition, the conscript learns how to create an antivenom for any poison he can obtain a sample of. He can prepare such an antivenom in 1 minute; if the conscript has a poison prepared from the alchemy sphere, he can convert it into an antivenom as a full-round action.</p>\n<p>Whenever the conscript confirms a critical with a poisoned weapon, the DC of the poison is increased by +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Masterful Chemistry (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, the conscript doubles the number of formulae he can have prepared at any one time, and the conscript also gains a +1 to the DCs of their Alchemy sphere poisons.</p>\n<p><strong>Master Alchemist (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the conscript doubles the affected area of any splash or burst items he uses; effects that normally only affect a single target instead affect all targets within 5 ft. of the point of impact, splash damage affects all creatures within 10 ft. instead of 5 ft., etc. In addition, the conscript may apply any poison in his possession to a wielded weapon as a free action, and each dose of poison applied to a weapon lasts for 1 additional attack.</p>\n",
