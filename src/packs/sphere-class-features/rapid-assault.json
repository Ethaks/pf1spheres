      "value": "<p>Starting at 5th level, the armiger becomes an expert at rapidly integrating multiple weapons into her attack routines. Whenever the armiger successfully damages a creature or succeeds on a combat maneuver while using the attack action with a customized weapon, she may expend martial focus as a swift action to make an additional attack against that creature at her highest base attack bonus. This attack takes a -2 penalty on the attack roll and can only be taken with a customized weapon other than the one used in the triggering attack. At 10th level and every five levels thereafter, the armiger may make an additional attack, as long as each previous attack was successful, using a different customized weapon each time and increasing the attack penalty by 2 each time. The armiger cannot use the same weapon twice in the same attack sequence with this ability. The armiger may spend a move action to move up to her speed between the triggering action and her first additional attack.</p>\n",
