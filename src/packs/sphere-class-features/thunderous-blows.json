      "value": "<p>Starting at 1st level, the blacksmith becomes particularly adept at striking crafted creations in exactly the right place and manner to damage them most effectively. When the blacksmith makes an attack action or attack of opportunity, he deals an additional 1d6 damage if making a successful sunder attempt or if attacking a construct or object (including animated objects). This damage increases by 1d6 at 3rd level and every two levels thereafter. The blacksmith never provokes attacks of opportunity for attempting the sunder combat maneuver, and whenever the blacksmith chooses to destroy an item held or worn by a creature with a sunder attempt any excess damage is applied to the item&#8217;s wielder. The blacksmith counts as having the Improved Sunder feat for determining prerequisites.</p>\n<p>At 3rd level, the blacksmith has learned how to swing his weapons in a way that shatters scales and claws as easily as manufactured armor and weapons. The blacksmith may make a special sunder attempt as an attack action, targeting a creature&#8217;s natural armor or natural weapons. If the blacksmith chooses to sunder the creature&#8217;s natural armor, on a successful check he deals damage to the creature equal to his normal weapon damage (bonus damage from thunderous blows is not applied when using sunder in this manner) and it takes a penalty to its natural armor bonus equal to the number of bonus damage dice granted by his thunderous blows class feature; a creature&#8217;s natural armor bonus cannot be reduced below 0 in this manner. Any amount of magical healing removes this penalty, as does a DC 15 Heal check, which can be made as a standard action.</p>\n<p>If the blacksmith chooses to sunder the creature&#8217;s natural weapon, on a successful check he deals damage to the creature equal to his normal weapon damage and it takes a penalty to attack rolls with that natural weapon equal to the number of bonus damage dice granted by his thunderous blows class feature for 1 round.</p>\n",
