      "value": "<p>At 1st level, a sage gains a pool of ki points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a sage&#8217;s ki pool is equal to his sage level + his Wisdom modifier. By spending 1 point from his ki pool, a sage can increase his speed by 20 ft. for 1 round. Alternatively, he can spend 1 point from his ki pool to give himself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action.</p>\n<p>Many esoteries and esoteric training packages require the sage to spend ki points to modify an effect; unless specifically stated otherwise, the sage cannot spend more ki points on an esotery or esoteric training ability than 1 + 1 per 5 class levels he possesses.</p>\n<p>The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<p><strong>Errata:</strong> This counts as both the casting and spell pool class features; a sage who gains a spell pool from another source calculates their total from both sources into a single pool as normal for a multiclass sphere caster. Sages gain two bonus talents if this is their first level in a casting class and qualify for a unified tradition, applying any appropriate casting limitations to their ki powers (so a sage with a casting tradition that includes the Verbal Casting drawback would apply that limitation to all of their ki powers, not just those that use magic talents).</p>\n",
