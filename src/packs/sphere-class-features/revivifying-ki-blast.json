      "value": "<p>Whenever the sage would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, or when the sage would be killed by an effect that would leave his body relatively intact, he may spend all his remaining ki as an immediate action to lob a ball of revivifying energy into the air. As long as the sage&#8217;s body remains within 10 ft. of the location he was in when he activated this ability, 1d4 rounds after the sage uses this ability the energy crashes back into his body; the sage is healed for 2d8 hit points per point of ki expended when activating this ability, even if the sage was killed by the triggering attack or during the time between when this healing is granted and the ability&#8217;s initial activation. As long as the sage&#8217;s hit points are above his normal threshold for dying after this effect resolves, he is restored to life and regains 1 ki point.</p>\n<p>The sage must be at least 8th level to select this esotery.</p>\n",
