      "value": "<p>Once per day, the commander can use the gather information function of the Diplomacy skill over an hour&#8217;s time to discern the locations and pass phrases (if any) of secret portals, tunnels, tears between planar locations, and similar effects in urban areas, or in ruins and cemeteries near urban areas; the commander cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. These passages are not necessarily permanent fixtures; they may be planar or astral convergences that only happen during particular times of the year, abnormal rifts created by recent events in the area, or any number of other possible occurrences. While passages uncovered using this ability are always reliable to the degree determined by the commander&#8217;s gather information check, there are no assurances that the events that created the passage will be still viable for longer than 48 hours past the travel time to reach them. The function and reliability of this ability is determined by his gather information check, as detailed on Table: Secret Ways.</p>\n<strong>Table: Secret Ways</strong><br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Gather Information DC</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>The commander learns of a passage within 1 week&#8217;s travel of the nearest settlement of at least 1,000 people that is capable of transporting a small group (maximum 10) to a location within 1 week&#8217;s travel of his desired destination.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>The commander learns of a passage within 1 day&#8217;s travel of the nearest settlement with at least 50 people that is capable of transporting a small group (maximum 10) to a location within 1 day&#8217;s travel of his desired destination.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>The commander learns of a passage within 1 day&#8217;s travel of his current location that is capable of transporting him and up to 100 humanoids a day to a location within 1 day&#8217;s travel of his desired destination, or to the nearest settlement.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>45</td>\n<td>The commander discovers the location of a passage within 4 hour&#8217;s travel of his current location capable of transporting himself and up to 1,000 humanoids a day directly to his desired destination, or to the nearest settlement.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"toc42\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Advanced Tactician</span></span></h2>\n<p>Commanders of at least 10th level may have two enhanced tactics active at a time, and may activate or switch both enhanced tactics using the largest same action, as long as it is the largest activation action from among the two (for example, the commander could activate two enhanced tactics that both require a move action as a move action, but an enhanced tactic that requires a standard action and an enhanced tactic that requires a move action would require a standard action to activate together).</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc43\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Expert Tactician</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the commander may have up to three enhanced tactics active at a time, and may activate or switch all three enhanced tactics using the same action as long as he uses the largest activation action.</p>\n",
