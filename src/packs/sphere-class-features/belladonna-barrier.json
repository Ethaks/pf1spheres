      "value": "<p>The scholar activates this imposition by quickly mixing a piece of belladonna root with several other herbs and minerals and then ingesting it or feeding it to an adjacent ally. This mixture protects the target from being subjected to the belladonna&#8217;s poison, and confers several of its properties to them. First, the target is immune to lycanthropy; if the target has already been afflicted with lycanthropy, they cannot be affected by or benefit from any of its effects for the duration of this ability. Secondly, the target gains a circumstance bonus to their armor class against all natural attacks equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus. These effects last for a number of rounds equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus. In addition, her work with belladonna has made the scholar particularly adept at treating and preventing poisoning; whenever the scholar uses her medical training, advanced medical training, or expert medical training on a creature, the subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the effect&#8217;s duration does not affect the subject until the effect&#8217;s duration has expired, though the duration of the effect continues to expire as normal; this does not reverse instantaneous effects of poison that have already occurred, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don&#8217;t go away on their own.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Belladonna Bursts [explosive]:</strong> The scholar may enhance her flashbangs with crushed belladonna, causing targets who fail their save to take 1d6 points of Strength damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of Strength damage at 8th and 16th level, in addition to the normal effects. This is a poison effect, and creatures with resistance to poison apply that resistance to their save against the flashbang&#8217;s effects.</li>\n</ul>\n",
