      "value": "<p>A striker can spend tension in order to accomplish incredible feats and each tension technique can only be used once per round (if an ability does not have an associated action listed, using it is a free action which can be done during anyone&#8217;s turn). Unless stated otherwise, you must activate a tension technique before any applicable rolls are made. For example, if you activate Expert Guard, you must do so before making a saving throw.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Tension</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expert Guard:</strong> For each tension a striker spends on this tension technique, she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on all saves until the beginning of her next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Fiery Offense:</strong> For each tension a striker spends on this tension technique, she gains a +1 circumstance bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes until the beginning of her next turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Light Step:</strong> The striker spends a swift action and selects a single creature, all movement she makes until the beginning of her next turn does not provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature.</li>\n<li><strong>Stalwart Form:</strong> For each tension a striker spends on this tension technique, she gains DR 1/- until the beginning of her next turn; this damage reduction stacks with similar damage reduction.</li>\n<li><strong>Timely Dodge:</strong> For each tension a striker spends on this tension technique, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to her armor class until the beginning of her next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2 Tension</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Critical Knuckle:</strong> The striker increases the critical threat range of her unarmed strikes by 1 until the beginning of her next turn; this bonus stacks with other increases to the striker&#8217;s unarmed strikes critical threat range, but is applied last.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfect Offensive:</strong> The striker automatically confirms a critical threat made with an unarmed strike.</li>\n<li><strong>Swift Focus:</strong> The striker spends a swift action to regain martial focus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3 Tension</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rapid Pummel:</strong> Whenever a striker makes an attack action with an unarmed strike or attempts a combat maneuver check as a standard action, she can spend a swift action to make an additional attack with an unarmed strike with a -2 penalty (she can wait until the results of the attack roll before deciding to use this tension technique) once per turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Second Chance:</strong> The striker can reroll a saving throw after the result has been revealed, although she must accept the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed Step:</strong> The striker can spend a swift action to move up to her speed with whatever methods of movement she possesses.</li>\n</ul>\n",
