      "value": "<p><strong>Born Leader:</strong> At 3rd level and every five levels thereafter, a conscript gains a teamwork feat he qualifies for as a bonus feat. The conscript may share these feats with any ally currently benefiting from one of his tactics or shouts, even if they would not normally qualify for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Triumphant Stand (Ex):</strong> Starting at 8th level, whenever a conscript would be dropped to 0 or fewer hit points by a melee or ranged weapon attack while he has a tactic active, any ally currently benefiting from the tactic may make an aid another check as an immediate action to add +2 to the conscript&#8217;s AC (to a maximum bonus of +10). If these bonuses would be enough to raise his AC above the attack roll for the triggering attack, the attack is instead treated as a miss and he takes no damage from it.</p>\n<p><strong>Concerted Finish (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever a conscript confirms a critical hit against a creature, each ally currently benefiting from one of the conscript&#8217;s tactics or shouts may make a single attack against the target as an immediate action. This attack may be made with a melee or ranged weapon, but the ally must be threatening the creature to make a melee attack, or have a ranged weapon in hand and ready to fire in order to make a ranged attack.</p>\n",
