      "value": "<p>Whether through ocean depths or over river rapids, the commander is a master of aquatic combat. When fighting in watery or aquatic terrain, the commander and any ally affected by one of his tactics or shouts never risk being swept away by water moving 60 ft. per round or faster, double the distance they can see underwater, do not take penalties as normal for attack and damage when fighting underwater with slashing or bludgeoning weapons, increase their base swim speed by 10 ft. (or gain a swim speed of 10 ft. if they do not already have one), and gain a bonus on Swim checks equal to 1/2 the commander&#8217;s class level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc30\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Group Focus (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, the commander may fly into a strenuous and exhausting flurry as a standard action, shouting out commands, redirecting attention, calling out threats, and generally imposing his will and order upon the battlefield, restoring the martial focus of all allies who can see and hear him. If an affected ally would not benefit from regaining martial focus, they instead gain a morale bonus to their attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, AC, and CMD equal to the higher of the commander&#8217;s Charisma or Intelligence bonus for 1 round. The commander may use this ability 1/day at 5th level, and gains an additional use every 6 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc31\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Logistic Specialty (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 7th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the commander learns a logistic specialty from the following list:</p>\n",
