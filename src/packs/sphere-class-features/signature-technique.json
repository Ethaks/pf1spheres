      "value": "<p>At 20th level the sage gains a powerful esotery from the following list that acts as his signature technique. The sage cannot select a signature technique unless he possesses the corresponding esoteric training package. Signature techniques follow all other rules for esoteries, including determining saving throw DCs and the number of ki points that can be spent when activating them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc79\"><span>Desiccate Essence (Manipulator) [AoP2]</span></h4>\n<p>The sage may make a single melee touch attack using his chi gong ability as a full-round action; if successful, the target of this attack must succeed at a Will saving throw or lose all ki points, martial focus, and spell points that they possess, in addition to suffering 2 permanent negative levels. A target that succeeds at their saving throw instead suffers 1 temporary negative level for 24 hours.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc80\"><span>Devastation Wave (Ki Blaster)</span></h4>\n<p>The sage&#8217;s ki blast now uses d10s instead of d6s for its damage dice. In addition, the sage may use a full round action to fire a powered up version of his ki blast. Instead of a ranged touch attack, the sage&#8217;s ki blast fires in a 10 ft. radius, 60 ft. long horizontal column originating from his square. Any creature within the area of this column takes damage as though hit by the sage&#8217;s ki blast (Reflex save for half).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc81\"><span>Heart Stopper (Chakra Disruptor)</span></h4>\n<p>The sage may make a single melee touch attack using his chi gong ability as a full round action; if successful, the target of this attack must make a Fortitude save or die. Even creatures that are not technically living, such as constructs and undead, can be affected by this technique as the sage&#8217;s ki tears through their bodies and disrupts the energies that animate them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc82\"><span>Physical Perfection (Enhancer)</span></h4>\n<p>The sage gains a +5 inherent bonus to each of his physical ability scores (Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength), gains DR 5/-, and increases his ki pool by 5 points. In addition, the sage no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken are removed. Age bonuses still accrue, and the sage still dies of old age when his time is up, but he doubles the maximum age limit for his species.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc83\"><span>Spider&#8217;s Web (Infuser)</span></h4>\n<p>As a full round action, the sage forms his ki into a wide web that can be hurled across the battlefield, covering everything within a 60 ft. radius sphere centered on the sage. This web lasts for a number of rounds equal to the sage&#8217;s Wisdom modifier. As long as this ability is active, the sage threatens every square within its radius and may make an unarmed strike, chi gong melee touch attack, or ki blast against any creature that provokes an attack of opportunity within this territory without moving from his current location, sending pulses of devastating ki arcing across the strands of this ki web.</p>\n",
