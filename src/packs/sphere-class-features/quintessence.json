      "value": "<p>Quintessence is the raw material from which the outer planes are formed, a nebulous substance which can subvert even the forces of time. The scholar can create and apply a spread of quintessence to a 5-foot square or a Medium-sized or smaller object within her natural reach (Large targets count as 2 Medium-sized targets, Huge targets count as 2 Large-sized targets, Gargantuan targets count as 2 Huge-sized targets, etc.). Quintessence can also be applied to willing creatures, although such creatures are considered helpless so long as they are covered and cannot remove the quintessence by their own power. Creating and applying this quintessence takes 1 round, which provokes attacks of opportunity. The scholar may create a number of 5-foot squares equal to 1/2 her class level per day.</p>\n<p>A creature which moves across a square covered in quintessence must succeed at a Will save or become staggered for a number of rounds equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Objects sealed within quintessence are protected from the effects of time; the creature does not grow older and its body functions virtually cease, putting creatures in a torpid state. The quintessence possesses 2 hit points per scholar level and can be removed by reducing it to 0 hit points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Inhibitor [explosive]:</strong> The energies of the planes can be used to weaken the magic of foes. Creatures that fail their save against the flashbang&#8217;s initial effect take a penalty to their caster level equal to 1 + 1 for every 3 scholar levels you possess for 1d4 rounds (minimum CL 1). Effects which remove confusion can be used to remove this caster level penalty</li>\n</ul>\n",
