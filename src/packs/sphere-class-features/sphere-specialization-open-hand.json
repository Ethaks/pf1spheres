At 7th level and every four levels afterwards, this bonus increases by +1.</p>\n<p><strong>Empty Fist (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, as long as a conscript has nothing in any of his hands, his unarmed strikes are treated as 1 size larger to a maximum size of Large. If they would normally be treated as Large, he instead gains a +1 circumstance bonus to damage for every 4 base attack bonus he possesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Empty Soul (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, as long as a conscript has nothing in any of his hands, he can add the shield bonus from his empty hand class feature to one of his saving throws as a circumstance bonus (he can change the saving throw to which this bonus is applied as a swift action).</p>\n",
