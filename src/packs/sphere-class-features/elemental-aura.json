      "value": "<p>The sage converts his ki into a raw energy aura that protects him by damaging his foes and amplifying his attacks. As long as the sage has at least 1 point of ki in his ki pool, he can spend a swift action to shroud his body in an aura of acid, cold, fire, or electricity (chosen when he activates this ability) that deals 1d8 damage, plus 1d8 damage for every 4 class levels he possesses, of the corresponding type to any creature who strikes the sage with a melee attack or otherwise comes into direct physical contact with the sage (such as when performing a combat maneuver or delivering a touch spell) for a number of rounds equal to the sage&#8217;s Wisdom modifier, or 1 minute if he expends a point of ki when activating this ability. While this ability is active, this additional damage is also added to the sage&#8217;s unarmed strikes and chi gong melee touch attacks, and dealt to any creature the sage successfully performs a combat maneuver against. The sage may end this effect as a free action. If the sage has the ki blaster esoteric training package, he can spend 1 point of ki while this ability is active as part of making a ki blast attack to add the energy damage to his ki blast damage until the start of his next turn; when using this ability, all ki blast attacks made for the round after the first are treated as having had 1 additional ki point spent on them when determining the maximum amount of ki that can be spent to modify their effects.</p>\n",
