      "value": "<p>Brimstone, also known as sulfur, has effects that can ward off illness and disease when used in small and controlled amounts. The scholar may activate this imposition by snapping a small piece of brimstone in two and placing it in a vest pocket or pouch resting between the nose and heart of a target creature within reach, granting a +1 competence bonus to Fortitude saves, +1 per 5 class levels she possesses. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to 1 + her Intelligence modifier. While a creature is benefiting from this imposition, any time a creature attempts a bite or swallow whole against them, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sulfuric Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar may enhance her flashbangs with large doses of brimstone, causing them to smoke and burn. In addition to the flashbang&#8217;s normal effects, the target also takes 1d6 points of fire damage per 2 class levels the scholar possesses; creatures who succeed on their Fortitude save against the flashbang take 1/2 damage from this effect. In addition, noxious smoke fills a radius around the target equal to 5 ft. + 5 ft. per four class levels the scholar possesses, causing any creature that is in the smoke to make a Fortitude save against the flashbang&#8217;s original DC or be sickened for as long as they remain in the effect and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. The smoke dissipates naturally after 1 minute, and is dispersed in 1 round by strong or stronger winds.</li>\n</ul>\n",
