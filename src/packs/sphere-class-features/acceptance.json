      "value": "<p>A warden of acceptance is aware of the inevitability of death, and despite coming to terms with it, still defends his allies to ensure that they come to death naturally. These wardens are the bane of undead, and commonly protect their allies from the brink of death.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Death</p>\n<p><strong>Accepting Guard:</strong> An accepting warden&#8217;s guard feels serene and calming. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guard immediately stabilizes his guarded allies when they would fall unconscious. If the warden would fall unconscious at the same time as the guarded ally (such as both being damaged by an area of effect), the ally is stabilized first, then loses the guard's benefits. Additionally, the warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a bonus to their Constitution score when determining when hit point damage would kill them equal to twice the warden&#8217;s guard bonus.</p>\n<p><strong>Grave Sight:</strong> At 7th level, the warden can, as a standard action, grant himself the benefits of either the Divine Life or Divine Undead alternate divination, instead having a range of close, and lasting 1 round per class level.</p>\n<p><strong>Tranquil Patrol:</strong> At 11th level, the warden may spend a spell point when using his patrol ability to instill the area around him with calming energy. Enemies attempting to enter or move within the warden&#8217;s area of patrol must succeed on a Will saving throw or be unable to move closer to the warden. Affected creatures may still move sideways or backwards. Undead creatures affected by this ability must roll their saving throw twice and take the lowest result. Creatures who succeed on their saving throw but remain within the area must attempt a new saving throw every round they remain within the area. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the warden&#8217;s class level.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul Ward:</strong> At 15th level, the warden&#8217;s guarded allies are instilled with a sense of calm and acceptance, and may roll saving throws against negative levels, Death sphere abilities, and death effects twice, taking the most favorable result.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit&#8217;s Ascension:</strong> At 19th level, the warden may spend 2 spell points as a standard action to grant a guarded ally the ability to flicker between life and death. For the next minute, the ally may spend a move action at any time to become incorporeal. While incorporeal, the guarded ally may move in any direction and pass through solid objects, in addition to the other benefits to being incorporeal. After this minute has passed, the ally becomes corporeal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc41\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Vigil Reinforcements</span></span></h3>\n<h4 id=\"toc42\"><span>Channel Energy (requires acceptance)</span></h4>\n<p>The warden gains the ability to channel positive energy, as the cleric class feature. The warden uses his class level -2 (minimum 1) as his cleric level, and may channel positive energy a number of times per day equal to 1 + his casting ability modifier (minimum 1).</p>\n",
