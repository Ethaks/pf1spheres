      "value": "<p>A warden of altruism tries to remain kind and optimistic whenever they can, and are always a beacon of hope and generosity among their allies. These wardens make great healers, always trying their best to prevent pain and anguish wherever they go.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Life</p>\n<p><strong>Altruistic Guard:</strong> An altruistic warden&#8217;s guard feels warm and invigorating. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a bonus to Fortitude saves equal to the warden&#8217;s guard bonus. Additionally, the warden is always aware of the condition of his guarded allies, as the Discern Condition Scout sphere talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejuvenating Presence:</strong> At 7th level, the warden may spend a spell point when using his patrol ability to grant all allies within his area of patrol fast healing equal to his casting ability modifier (minimum 1) until the end of his next turn. This healing cannot heal a creature beyond half their maximum hit points. If the warden would reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he can keep extending the duration of the ability by one additional round without spending a spell point.</p>\n<p><strong>Sustain Harm:</strong> At 11th level, whenever an ally within the warden&#8217;s area of patrol suffers damage while he has a patrol active, he may expend an attack of opportunity to reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to the warden&#8217;s class level.</p>\n<p><strong>Disperse Healing:</strong> At 15th level, whenever the warden would recover hit points or ability damage, as a free action, he may divert any amount healed to any allies within his guard range. The amount diverted may differ for each ally, but the warden must heal at least 1 hit point or point of ability damage for this ability to function.</p>\n<p><strong>Lifebound Connection (Su):</strong> At 19th level, the warden&#8217;s guarded allies become immune to ability damage and drain (ignoring the effects of any ability damage or drain they may have at the time for the guard&#8217;s duration), in addition to maximizing any effect that would heal hit point damage.</p>\n<p>Additionally, all guarded allies within the warden&#8217;s guard range do not die until their negative hit point total exceeds twice their Constitution score.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc44\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Vigil Reinforcements</span></span></h3>\n<h4 id=\"toc45\"><span>Benevolent Guard (requires altruism)</span></h4>\n<p>The warden&#8217;s guarded allies gains a circumstance bonus to Diplomacy and Heal checks equal to twice the warden&#8217;s guard bonus.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc46\"><span>Transfer Affliction (requires altruism)</span></h4>\n<p>Whenever the warden&#8217;s guarded allies would be inflicted with the blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued, nauseated, paralyzed, sickened, staggered, or stunned condition, the warden may instead inflict this condition on himself instead of his ally as an immediate action. This ability does not function if the warden would be immune to the condition he is attempting to transfer.</p>\n",
