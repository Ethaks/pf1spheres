      "value": "<p>The mageknight gains an animal companion, treating her mageknight level -3 as her effective druid level. This stacks normally with other druid levels.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the mageknight may take a lesser c&#249;-s&#236;th as their companion. This functions as a wolf animal companion, except that it has an Intelligence score of 10 and the mageknight may spend a spell point as an immediate action on her lesser c&#249;-s&#236;th&#8217;s turn to allow it to use its baleful howl special attack as a standard action, with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 its Hit Dice + her casting ability modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Baleful Howl (Su)</strong> As a standard action, the c&#249;-s&#236;th can release a howl of ill omen. All enemies within 60 feet take a -4 penalty to saves against curse and death effects and against the c&#249;-s&#236;th&#8217;s soul shepherd ability, as well as a -4 penalty to AC. These penalties last for 5 rounds. These penalties are reduced to -1 and last only a single round with a successful Will save. This is a sonic curse effect.</p>\n",
