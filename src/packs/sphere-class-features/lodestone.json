      "value": "<p>Lodestone&#8217;s unusual properties often seem like magic to the uninitiated, but to the scholar, it is a predictable and reliable tool. The scholar may activate this imposition in one of two ways: firstly, the scholar may draw one primarily metal item or creature within 60 ft. + 10 ft. per class level directly towards herself. This item or creature cannot weigh more than 50 lbs. per class level the scholar possesses, and if it is a living creature or an item held by a living creature, the scholar must succeed on a combat maneuver check against the opponent&#8217;s CMD, using her class level in place of her base attack bonus and her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier for the check. Upon a successful use of this ability, the targeted creature or item is moved up to 10 ft. per class level directly towards the scholar; if this ability is used on a creature, this movement provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the scholar may use this ability to repel all metal creatures or objects within a 30 ft. radius; this ability cannot effect a single item or creature whose weight is more than 50 lbs. per class level the scholar possesses. Any unattended metal objects within the radius of this effect are immediately moved directly away from the scholar to the first legal square outside of the effect&#8217;s radius; when the scholar activates this ability, she makes a single combat maneuver check using her class level in place of her base attack bonus and her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier and compares the result against the CMD of all metal creatures or creatures wielding metal equipment within the area&#8217;s effect, moving any creature whose CMD her check exceeds directly away to the first legal square outside of the effect&#8217;s radius. Creatures wielding metal weapons may choose to drop them rather than be subject to this ability&#8217;s effects, but creatures wearing metal armor are treated as metal creatures for determining this ability&#8217;s effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Magnetic Bursts [explosive]:</strong> Scholars with the lodestone material imposition may enhance their flashbangs with lodestone flakes that cling to the target, making it easier for metallic weapons, or weapons whose primary damage- dealing apparatus is composed of metal, such as spear or arrowheads, to hit the target. For the next 1d4 rounds, any attack made with a metal weapon against a target who has failed their save against a flashbang modified with this explosive gains a +1 circumstance bonus to the attack roll, +1 for every 3 class levels the scholar possesses.</li>\n</ul>\n",
