      "value": "<p>At 1st level, the crimson dancer can hold a small pool of collected life force that she can use to power her abilities, known as vitae. A crimson dancer's maximum vitae is equal to her class level + her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). She begins the day with no vitae, but this amount changes throughout the day. If the crimson dancer spends over 1 minute without gaining a point of vitae, she begins to lose points at a rate of one per round. Vitae cannot be gained through any source from a creature that has less than half the crimson dancer's class level in Hit Dice, and cannot be gained if the crimson dancer is not in combat.</p>\n<p>The crimson dancer can gain vitae in the following ways, known as vitae sources. Unless otherwise specified, each vitae source can only grant vitae points once per round. Some sources are only gained at specific levels, or are gained when specific class features are obtained.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bloodletting:</strong> When the crimson dancer inflicts her bloodletting to a creature using at least a standard action, she gains 1 point of vitae.</li>\n<li><strong>Relish:</strong> Whenever the crimson dancer ends her turn adjacent to at least two or more creatures suffering from her bloodletting bleed, the crimson dancer gains 2 points of vitae.</li>\n<li><strong>Absorb Burst (2nd level):</strong> If a creature fails the saving throw against the crimson dancer's burst ability, she gains 1 point of vitae.</li>\n<li><strong>Voracity (4th level):</strong> If the crimson dancer has spent at least 1 minute with her vitae pool at 0, the next time the crimson dancer gains vitae from any source, she regains an additional 1 point of vitae.</li>\n<li><strong>Thrilling Bloodshed (6th level):</strong> Whenever the crimson dancer causes a creature to become exsanguinated, she gains 1 point of vitae.</li>\n<li><strong>Bound by Blood (8th level):</strong> At the end of each round, if the crimson dancer has at least one creature other than herself under the effects of her blood control, she gains 1 point of vitae.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The crimson dancer can spend vitae in the following ways, known as vitae abilities. Some abilities are only gained at specific levels, or are gained when specific class features are obtained.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Metabolize:</strong> The crimson dancer can ingest collected life force to heal themselves. As a standard action, she can spend any amount of vitae points, regaining 1d6 hit points per point of vitae spent. If she spends at least five points, she also removes the fatigued, shaken, and sickened conditions. The crimson dancer can only heal an amount of dice equal to 1/2 her class level per hour, but can still be used to remove conditions. This healing is not a positive or negative energy effect and can heal a crimson dancer of any creature type.</li>\n<li><strong>Staunch:</strong> The crimson dancer can spend a point of vitae as a swift action to touch a creature, attempting a Heal check with a bonus equal to her class level to end any bleed effects they are suffering from.</li>\n<li><strong>Empower:</strong> The crimson dancer can spend five points of vitae as part of casting a non-harmless sphere effect to grant herself a +1 bonus to her caster level for that effect, increasing to +2 at 10th level. This can only be used once per sphere effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Focus:</strong> The crimson dancer may spend two points of vitae as a swift action to regain her martial focus. By spending six points of vitae, she may do this as a free action that can be taken outside of her turn.</li>\n<li><strong>Talented Vitality (3rd level):</strong> When attempting any Dexterity-, Strength-, or Wisdom-based skill check, the crimson dancer can spend 2 points of vitae to gain a +2 competence bonus to that check, which increases by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter.</li>\n<li><strong>Hunter&#8217;s Sprint (5th level):</strong> By spending 2 points of vitae, the crimson dancer can take special movement action as a full-round action, allowing her to move up to ten times her movement speed. She may only use this ability to move closer to a bleeding creature, either by following their tracks or if the creature is in her line of sight, moving as close as she can to that creature.</li>\n</ul>\n",
