      "value": "<p>Silver is the metal most closely related to the moon and is said to ward off bad luck and witchcraft. When the scholar first gains this imposition she learns how to craft a small amulet that must use at least 10 sp worth of silver and costs 1 hour and a total of 100 gp times the scholar&#8217;s class level to create. A silver amulet crafted in this manner may be sold for 1/2 its crafting cost, as long as it is currently functioning. As long as the scholar or an ally is wearing this amulet, they gain spell resistance equal to 10 + the scholar&#8217;s class level. These charms do not occupy an item slot, but wearing more than one has no additional effect. Because they are not true magic items but rather science and geometry applied in a way that interferes with magical energies, these amulets are exceedingly fragile, and they cease to function after they have forced casters to attempt a caster level check to overcome the granted spell resistance a number of times equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), as determined at the time the amulet was crafted. Once this limit has been reached, the amulet ceases to function until the scholar spends at least 1 hour re-attuning it. As an immediate action, the scholar may expend their martial focus to quickly realign the amulet, causing a caster level check to not consume one of its uses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dispelling Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar adds a mixture of silver, salt, lead, and other materials which naturally disrupt magical energies to her flashbangs. Creatures and objects that fail their save against the flashbang&#8217;s initial effect are also subject to a targeted dispel magic spell, using the scholar&#8217;s level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. If the scholar also possesses the circle of salt material imposition, this instead acts as a targeted greater dispel magic effect.</li>\n</ul>\n",
