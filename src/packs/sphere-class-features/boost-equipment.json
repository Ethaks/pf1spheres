      "value": "<p>Beginning at 10th level, instead of summoning equipment, the armorist may touch a piece of magical equipment and spend a spell point to increase its enhancement bonus by half the bonus she may grant to summoned equipment (minimum +1). This has the same duration as summoned equipment and causes the item to count as summoned equipment for the purpose of arsenal tricks. This requires a standard action to boost equipment being wielded by another, but can be done with the same action cost as summoning equipment if the armorist is already touching or wielding the piece of equipment. The armorist must be able to summon a type of equipment (weapons, shields, or armor) in order to boost a piece of similar equipment.</p>\n<p>Just as with summoned equipment, a boost cannot raise a piece of equipment&#8217;s enhancement bonus higher than +5, but can be traded for special abilities. Boosting an item a second time replaces the first boosting, and pieces of bound equipment cannot be boosted.</p>\n",
