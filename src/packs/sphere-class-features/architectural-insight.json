      "value": "<p>With 10 minutes of work, the technician can expend a gadget to create quick, artificial structures that last for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>The nature of the structure depends on what materials are available; if the technician only has cloth available he can create a cloth structure, but if he is in a forest or has access to wood he may build a structure out of wood, and if he is in a cave with loose stones or have access to stone he could build a structure out of stone. The technician must have about 10 square feet of cloth, 50 lbs. of wood, or 100 lbs. of stone to create a 5 ft. square of structure. Other materials can be substituted with GM permission, and the GM makes the final decision about what materials are available. All structures have 5 hp per technician level, but a hardness dependent on the material in question (0 for cloth, 5 for wood, 8 for stone).</p>\n<p>There are three types of structures that can be created: huts, platforms, and walls.</p>\n<p>Huts give cover from all sides except any entrances the technician chooses to leave. Huts provide cover and impede movement as walls do, except they only fill a 5 ft. space. This hut can comfortably sit 2 people. Several huts can be combined together to form a single, larger hut.</p>\n<p>Platforms either raise terrain by 5 ft. in a single 5 ft. square, or create a bridge or platform up to 5 ft. wide and 15 ft. long. The platforms themselves are about an inch thick.</p>\n<p>Walls are 10 ft. tall and long, and impede movement unless a creature first climbs or destroys the wall. The technician may expend an additional gadget when creating the wall to create stairs to allow easy scaling on one side, and to allow someone climbing the wall from that side to stand on the top and fire, retaining partial cover from attacks coming from the other side.</p>\n",
