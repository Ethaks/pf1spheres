      "value": "<p>The scholar carefully lays out an unbroken circle of salt, creating a protective circle around herself and up to 1 adjacent ally per 2 class levels (minimum 1) that lasts for a number of rounds equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). If a protected ally moves outside of the square they occupied when the circle was created, the protective energy is disrupted and the effect immediately ends. While within this circle, the scholar and protected allies gain a circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Whenever the scholar succeeds on a saving throw against such an effect while protected by the circle, she immediately regains her martial focus if it is currently expended.</p>\n<p>In addition, while within the circle, the scholar and affected allies are also protected from bodily contact by summoned creatures and incorporeal undead. This causes the natural weapons and touch attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection ends if the warded creature takes any hostile action against a blocked creature, and that creature may pass through the barrier (though other creatures are still warded as normal).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dispelling Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar adds a mixture of silver, salt, lead, and other materials which naturally disrupt magical energies to her flashbangs. Creatures that fail their save against the flashbang&#8217;s initial effect are also subject to a targeted dispel magic spell, using the scholar&#8217;s level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. If the scholar also possesses the silver material imposition, this instead acts as a targeted greater dispel magic effect.</li>\n</ul>\n",
