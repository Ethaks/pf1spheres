      "value": "<p>At 16th level, if a target is at negative hit points or has died within 1 round, the soul weaver may expend a soul to trap the target&#8217;s soul. The target must succeed at a Will save or their soul is taken and added to the soul weaver&#8217;s bound nexus as a new soul, which they may expend and summon as normal (so long as the soul weaver possesses the trapped soul, the soul expended to use this ability is released from service and returns to the nether). This does not increase the soul weaver&#8217;s total number of souls. The subject of this ability cannot be resurrected unless the soul weaver is killed or voluntarily chooses to release the soul from service. While the soul is in the soul weaver&#8217;s possession, the soul weaver may speak with and question the soul, which retains the knowledge it had in life, but is under no obligation to answer questions (although bargaining for a peaceful release into the afterlife is usually enough to get a spirit to talk).</p>\n",
