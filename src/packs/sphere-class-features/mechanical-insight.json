      "value": "<p>The technician unlocks special options for his inventions, as detailed under that section. He may also give his independent inventions the clockwork subtype by adding the following properties (a construct or independent invention cannot possess more than one subtype):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Winding:</strong> The construct must be wound with a special key in order to function. As a general rule, a fully wound clockwork can remain active for 1 day per HD, but shorter or longer durations are possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerable to Electricity:</strong> Clockwork constructs take 150% as much damage as is normal from electricity attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Swift Reactions:</strong> Clockwork constructs generally react much more swiftly than other constructs. They gain Improved Initiative and Lightning Reflexes as bonus feats, and gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficult to Create:</strong> Increase the time and gp cost required to create a clockwork construct by 50% over normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, he may add one of the following triggering mechanisms to his detonators, chosen whenever one is created. When using any of these triggering mechanisms, the detonator becomes inert if not detonated within 10 minutes per technician level, and may be recovered to reclaim the expended gadget.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Land Mine:</strong> A tripwire trigger causes the detonator to explode when a creature enters its square. This allows the detonator to count as a snare trap for the purpose of Trap sphere talents such as Remote Trigger and Trap Wielder.</li>\n<li><strong>Remote:</strong> A remote trigger allows the gadget to be placed as a standard action, then triggered as a swift action from anywhere within medium range. He may place multiple detonators and detonate them with the same swift action, but as mentioned under detonators, multiple blast radiuses do not stack.</li>\n<li><strong>Timed:</strong> A timed trigger causes the detonator to explode after a set amount of time. A timed trigger has a duration of 1 hour per technician level rather than 10 minutes per technician level.</li>\n</ul>\n",
