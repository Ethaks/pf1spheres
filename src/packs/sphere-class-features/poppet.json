      "value": "<p>The hedgewitch can create a poppet that possesses a sympathetic link to a creature, allowing her to affect them with her magic regardless of distance. To create a poppet, she must personally collect a specimen directly from the creature&#8217;s body, such as a hair, a nail cutting, or drop of blood. Within 24 hours of collection, she must create a small poppet that incorporates the entire specimen, a process that takes 1 full minute and requires common materials of negligible cost (such as a handful of straw, mud, or wood). The poppet lasts indefinitely once created. When she uses a magic sphere ability, she may target the poppet to affect the creature it was made from, allowing her to affect them regardless of distance or line of sight, though they must be on the same plane. The sympathetic link makes the creature immediately aware of the incoming effect and allows them to defend against it without being surprised, even if asleep, though they are not made aware of the magic&#8217;s precise nature or source. After conveying magic 1 + 1 time per 10 hedgewitch levels, the poppet crumbles and becomes useless. She may only possess a number of poppets equal to her casting ability modifier at one time, and only one poppet at a time for any given creature. If she collects a sample for a new poppet that would put her over these limits, an older poppet crumbles (either the already existing poppet for the creature targeted if she has one, or one of her choice if she does not).</p>\n",
