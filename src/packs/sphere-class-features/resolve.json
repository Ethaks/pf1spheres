      "value": "<p>Starting at 1st level, the conscript gains resolve that he can call upon to endure even the most devastating wounds and afflictions. He can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every two conscript levels beyond 1st. Whenever the conscript defeats a target, he regains one daily use of his resolve, up to his maximum number of uses per day. Defeating a target usually involves reducing the target to 0 hit points or fewer, but the GM might rule that an enemy who surrenders or flees the battle is also defeated. He can use this resolve in a number of ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Determined:</strong> As a standard action, the conscript can spend one use of his resolve to remove the fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition. If the conscript is at least 8th level, he can alternatively remove the exhausted, frightened, nauseated, or staggered condition. If the condition has a duration longer than 1 hour or is permanent, this ability removes the condition for 1 hour, at which time the condition returns. The duration of effects suppressed by this ability continues during the hour in which it is suppressed.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolute:</strong> Whenever the conscript is required to make a Fortitude or Will save, he can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to roll twice and take the better result. He must decide to use this ability before he rolls the saving throw.</li>\n<li><strong>Unstoppable:</strong> When the conscript is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points but not slain, he can spend one use of his resolve as an immediate action to instantly stabilize and remain conscious. He is staggered, but he does not fall unconscious and begin dying if he takes a standard action. He does fall unconscious if he takes additional damage from any source, unless he spends an additional use of resolve as an immediate action. A conscript reduced to a sufficient number of negative hit points to kill him still dies as normal.</li>\n</ul>\n",
