      "value": "<p>Starting at 2nd level, the blacksmith may use Profession (blacksmith) in place of all Craft and Spellcraft skill checks made to create, modify, repair, and enchant weapons, armor, and shields, and he gains a competence bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) on all Profession (blacksmith) checks. In addition, the smith learns to quickly repair damaged objects, restoring 2 hit points per class level he possesses to an object as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for this ability to function. Magic items can be repaired by this ability, but the blacksmith&#8217;s class level must be equal to or higher than the caster level of the object. This ability does not affect creatures (including constructs). This ability has no effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair damage done to such items. This ability can be used to repair nonmagical weapons, armor, and shields that have been destroyed, as long as all the pieces are together in an accessible location. At 5th level, the blacksmith no longer provokes an attack of opportunity for using this ability.</p>\n",
