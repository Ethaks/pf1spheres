      "value": "<p><strong>Companion Creature (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript gains the Beastmastery sphere Animal Companion talent twice, giving the conscript a full progression animal companion. In addition, the conscript can use Handle Animal in place of Knowledge (nature) to identify creatures with the animal type, or use Ride if the animal would be a suitable mount.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature&#8217;s Friend (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, creatures of the animal type have a starting attitude toward the conscript one step better than normal, to a maximum of friendly. Whenever the conscript attempts a Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check against a creature that is the same type of creature as their mount or animal companion, they receive a competence bonus on the check equal to 1/2 their class level (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Beast Master (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript is always treated as though they rolled a natural 20 when making a Handle Animal, Knowledge (nature), or Ride check. In addition the conscript gains one of the following options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any creature the conscript is mounted on gains gains fast healing 5 and a competence bonus to AC, combat maneuver defense, and all saving throws equal to half the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus.</li>\n<li>The conscript&#8217;s mount or animal companion improves any armor proficiency it may have by one step (non-proficient to light, light to medium, medium to heavy), and gains a competence bonus on damage rolls and saving throws equal to 1/2 the conscript&#8217;s base attack bonus as long as it has line of sight to the conscript. Whenever the conscript takes damage from an attack while his mount or animal companion is in line of sight, his mount or animal companion may move up to its maximum base speed directly towards the conscript as an immediate action.</li>\n</ul>\n",
