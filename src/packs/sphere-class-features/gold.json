      "value": "<p>Gold is the metal most closely associated with the sun, willpower, and vitality. By following a carefully designed formula and creating a small structure in an adjacent square using at least 50 gp worth of gold, the scholar and all allies in a 30 ft. radius of the structure are protected from the powers of negative energy and undeath, gaining a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against death effects, disease, and paralysis effects for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 her class level (minimum: 1). This bonus increases by +2 for every five class levels the scholar possesses. In addition, any undead creature attempting to enter the protected radius of the structure must succeed on a Will save or find itself prevented from entering. The structure can be destroyed if it takes a number of points of damage equal to 5 times the scholar&#8217;s class level; as long as the structure is not destroyed, the scholar can retrieve it and recoup the gold used in its construction as a move action.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purifying Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar learns how to mix small amounts of gold flakes and holy water into her flashbangs, allowing her to damage undead with positive energy in addition to the flashbang&#8217;s normal effects, though the target must make a Will save instead of the Fortitude save normally granted. Undead creatures targeted by this ability take 1d6 points of positive energy damage per class level the scholar possesses. This ability has no effect on living creatures, unless they are also damaged by positive energy, such as most dhampirs. Undead who succeed on their Will save take 1/2 damage from this effect.</li>\n</ul>\n",
