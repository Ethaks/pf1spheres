      "value": "<p>At 2nd level, as part of starting a sequence, the prodigy may infuse himself with mystic energy tied to one magic sphere she possesses. Only a single imbue ability may be applied at a time, though the imbuement may be changed as a swift action. If the sequence ends or the prodigy changes the imbuement, any benefits of the imbuement are lost immediately. Each imbuement also unlocks the (finish) ability or abilities tied to the same sphere. If an ability has a range or save DC, it is defined based on the prodigy&#8217;s caster level with that sphere. Imbuement effects do not cost spell points or require concentration unless noted. Beginning an imbuement or activating a finisher are sphere effects, though neither provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc37\"><span><a href=\"/alteration\">Alteration</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Minor Shapeshift (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains one trait that she may apply to the blank form option of shapeshift. This is in addition to any traits otherwise granted by shapeshift. This is a polymorph effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Tentacle Swarm (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy sprouts tentacles, allowing her to make one trip combat maneuver per link in her sequence against creatures within close range. No one creature may be targeted by more than one trip attempt.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc38\"><span><a href=\"/bear\">Bear</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Bearing (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains one bearacteristic. Bearacteristics that require additional spell point costs must have the additional cost paid.</p>\n<p><strong>Bear Rush (finish):</strong> As a standard action,the prodigy may summon a mass of bears, trampling and mauling all creatures in a line 10-ft. wide by 10-ft. long per link in her sequence. Creatures in this area must succeed on a Reflex save or be knocked prone and take 1d6 bludgeoning and slashing damage per character level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc39\"><span><a href=\"/blood\">Blood</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Bleeding Cuts (imbue):</strong> The prodigy&#8217;s attack actions deal additional bleed damage equal to half her class level. This bleed damage does not stack with itself or other sources of bleed damage unless noted.</p>\n<p><strong>Extract Minions (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may extract blood constructs (as the Extract Blood Construct talent) from a number of creatures equal to the length of her sequence. Multiple small constructs may be combined to form a larger one. These constructs disappear after a number of rounds equal to the length of her sequence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc40\"><span><a href=\"/conjuration\">Conjuration</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Double Team (imbue):</strong> The prodigy adds half the length of her sequence (minimum 1) to any aid another or flanking bonuses granted by her Conjuration companion.</p>\n<p><strong>Conjure Army (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may summon a number of copies of a Conjuration companion equal to the number of links in her sequence. Each copy appears within close range and makes a single attack. A single creature cannot be targeted by more than half the duplicates. After resolving the attack, the duplicates disappear. Damage dealt to and effects imposed on the duplicates have no effect on the base companion. These temporary copies do not grant flanking bonuses to other creatures, though may benefit from them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc41\"><span><a href=\"/creation\">Creation</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Breaker (imbue) (requires alter):</strong> When dealing damage to an object, the prodigy may ignore a number of points of hardness equal to her class level. If you possess the ability that allows you to ignore hardness equal to levels in another class, the bonus from this imbue stacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Debris Field (imbue) (requires create):</strong> As a swift action, the prodigy may litter the ground with created objects, creating difficult terrain in a radius equal to 5 ft. per link in her active sequence within close range. These objects disappear when this (imbue) ends or when it is used again.</p>\n<p><strong>Sudden Arsenal (imbue) (requires create):</strong> The prodigy may create a weapon, armor, or shield, and up to 50 pieces of ammunition. These items follow the normal rules for the create ability. These items disappear when the imbuement ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Anvil Drop (finish) (requires create):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may create a number of objects equal to the length of her sequence within her create range. Each object is of the largest size she can create. If the prodigy possesses the Larger Creation talent, she may spend a spell point to be able to create larger objects per that talent. These objects disappear at the beginning of her next turn. No one creature may be targeted by a number of objects greater than half the length of the sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Petrify (finish) (requires alter):</strong> As a full-round action, the prodigy may make an attack action. If this attack action deals damage to a creature or object, the prodigy may spend a spell point to force the target to succeed on a Fortitude save or be turned to stone for a number of rounds equal to half the length of the sequence. Creatures turned to stone by this ability may make a new save each round to end the effect early, but are staggered for the remainder of the effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc42\"><span><a href=\"/dark\">Dark</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Shadow (imbue):</strong> The prodigy becomes the center of a darkness and is unaffected by that darkness. She may spend a move action and any necessary spell points to add a single (darkness) talent to this darkness. This darkness may only benefit from a single (dark) talent at a time; adding one ends the previous talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunset (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may create a darkness centered on himself that extends out to long range, applying (dark) talents as normal. This effect moves with her and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the length of her sequence. The prodigy is unaffected by this darkness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc43\"><span><a href=\"/death\">Death</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Vampiric Blade (imbue):</strong> The prodigy adds half her class level to damage rolls as negative energy damage when making an attack action. When this damage is dealt, the prodigy gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the negative energy damage inflicted. These temporary hit points stack with themselves up to twice the prodigy&#8217;s class level.</p>\n<p><strong>Walking Dead (finish):</strong> As a move action, the prodigy may reanimate 1 valid target within close range for a number of rounds equal to the length of her sequence. She may instead reanimate a number of targets equal to the length of her sequence for a number of rounds equal to her casting ability modifier as a full-round action.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc44\"><span><a href=\"/destruction\">Destruction</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Destructive Edge (imbue):</strong> The prodigy adds her class level in damage when making an attack action. The type of this damage matches a blast type she possesses (or bludgeoning if she only possesses the base sphere) and does not stack with the corrosive, flaming, frost, or shock special abilities or similar abilities that add damage of the same type.</p>\n<p><strong>Explosive Finish (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may create a burst centered on himself with a radius of up to 5 ft. per link in the sequence. This burst matches one (blast type) talent available to the prodigy, dealing one die of damage per class level as well as any additional effects of the (blast type) talent. If the selected (blast type) carries a spell point cost, the prodigy must pay this cost. The prodigy may exclude himself from this burst.<br>\n<sup><strong>Errata:</strong> A Reflex save negates the effect of an Explosive Finish. (Per conversation with Author)</sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"toc45\"><span><a href=\"/divination\">Divination</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Clear Sighted (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saves and AC, +1 per 6 class levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Precognizant Save (finish):</strong> As an immediate action when making a saving throw, the prodigy may gain an insight bonus on the save equal to her sequence length. (Reminder: insight bonuses do not stack, such as this and the imbue ability above.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc46\"><span><a href=\"/enhancement\">Enhancement</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Combatant (imbue):</strong> The prodigy, a weapon she wields, or a piece of armor or shield that she has equipped gains the benefit of one (enhance) talent that she possesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Animate Ally (finish):</strong> As a move action, the prodigy can animate one object per the Animate Object talent for a number of rounds equal to the length of her sequence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc47\"><span><a href=\"/fallen-fey\">Fallen Fey</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Fey Manner (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains the benefit of one (fey blessing) talent she possesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Seelie Beauty (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may force a number of creatures equal to her sequence length within close range to make Reflex saves or be blinded for a number of rounds equal to the half the length of the sequence (minimum 0).</p>\n<p><strong>Unseelie Terror (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may force a number of creatures equal to her sequence length within close range to make Will saves or be frightened for a number of rounds equal to the length of the sequence.</p>\n<p>(This sphere is found in the Player's Guide to Skybourne, and is available on this site.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc48\"><span><a href=\"/fate\">Fate</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Lucky (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains the benefits of a consecration. She may spend a move action and any necessary spell points to center a non-instantaneous consecration on herself. She may only have a single consecration active with this ability at a time; beginning one ends the previous talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Curse (finish):</strong> As a swift action, the prodigy may force a creature within close range to suffer a penalty on all d20 rolls equal to the length of her sequence until the start of the prodigy&#8217;s next turn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc49\"><span><a href=\"/illusion\">Illusion</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Blurred (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains a 20% miss chance against all attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Vanish (finish):</strong> As a swift action, the prodigy may become difficult to spot, as the invisibility effect of the Suppression (glamer) talent, for a number of rounds equal to the length of her sequence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc50\"><span><a href=\"/life\">Life</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Regenerate (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains fast healing equal to the length of her sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Burst (finish):</strong> As a move action, all allied creatures within close range heal a number of hit points equal to the prodigy&#8217;s casting ability modifier multiplied by the number of links in her sequence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc51\"><span><a href=\"/light\">Light</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Sunrise (imbue):</strong> The prodigy sheds bright light per glow. She may spend a move action and any necessary spell points to add a single (light) talent to this glow. This glow may only benefit from a single (light) talent at a time; adding one ends the previous talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Nova (finish):</strong> As a move action, the prodigy can emit a blinding flash. All creatures within up to a 5 ft. plus 5 ft. per link in the prodigy&#8217;s active sequence radius must make a Reflex save or be blinded for a number of rounds equal to half the length of the sequence (minimum 0). The prodigy may exclude herself from this effect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc52\"><span><a href=\"/mana\">Mana</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Inject Dissonance (imbue):</strong> When the prodigy strikes a creature with an attack action, they gain a dissonance point, which bestows a cumulative -1 penalty to the creature&#8217;s caster level, magic skill bonus and magic skill defense. Creatures whose caster level would be reduced to or below 0 are unable to cast spells, spell-like abilities, and sphere effects as if they were inside an antimagic zone. A creature can rid themselves of dissonance points with the use of the restore soul option of the restore ability from Life sphere (treating it as if it was ability damage), or by spending a spell point as a move action to remove 1 point. Dissonance points expire after 1 minute after the last dissonance point is applied on a creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Whence They Came (finish):</strong> As a 3 link finisher, the prodigy may make a special attack action to implode a creature&#8217;s dissonance points. Doing so deals damage as normal, and forces the creature to attempt a Fortitude save. On failure, the creature suffers 1d8 untyped damage for each dissonance point they have, and all dissonance points are removed. If the sequence has at least 7 links, the creature additionally loses 1 spell point (if they have any) for each dissonance point they had.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc53\"><span><a href=\"/mind\">Mind</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Mind Breaker (imbue):</strong> When the prodigy succeeds on a combat maneuver or deals damage with an attack action, the target takes a -1 penalty to saves against charm and compulsion effects until the end of the prodigy&#8217;s next turn. This penalty increases by 1 every 7 character levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Enslave (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may attempt to dominate the mind of a creature within close range. This functions as the powerful charm ability of the Command talent. The prodigy need not concentrate on this effect and the duration is a number of rounds equal to half the length of the prodigy&#8217;s sequence (minimum 0 rounds).</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc54\"><span><a href=\"/nature\">Nature</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Aura of Flame (imbue) (requires Fire Geomancing):</strong> All hostile creatures within a 5-ft. radius of the prodigy at the end of their turn takes fire damage equal to the number of links in the sequence and must make a Reflex save or catch on fire, taking 1d6 fire damage per round. This area increases by 5 ft. for every 2 additional links in the prodigy&#8217;s current sequence. If a creature is already on fire, each round it remains within this aura, the damage from being on fire increases by 1d6. Affected targets can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage with a successful Reflex save; rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a large body of water or magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.</p>\n<p><strong>Fog of War (imbue) (requires Water Geomancing):</strong> The prodigy is shrouded in heavy mist to a 5-ft. radius per link. This mist grants concealment (20% miss chance) from any creature further than 5 ft. away to any creature inside of it. The prodigy is not hindered by the mist.</p>\n<p><strong>Greenstep (imbue) (requires Plant Geomancing):</strong> The prodigy may ignore difficult terrain caused by plantlife (including magical plantlife) and may see unhindered through plantlife up to 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Steel Skin (imbue) (requires Metal Geomancing):</strong> The prodigy reduces the ACP of any metal armor she is wearing and of metal shields she has equipped by a number equal to half her level. She also gains an insight bonus to CMD against sunder attempts and saves against effects that target such equipment equal to the length of her sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Tunnel (imbue) (requires Earth Geomancing):</strong> The prodigy gains a burrow speed of 20 ft. + 5 ft. per 5 class levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Wind Barrier (imbue) (requires Air Geomancing) [Apoc]:</strong> The prodigy gains a bonus to armor class vs. ranged attacks equal to the length of her sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Nature Surge (finish):</strong> The prodigy may cast a single geomancing effect with its normal action, gaining an insight bonus on the caster level equal to the length of her sequence. (Note: As an insight bonus, this does not stack with the bonus from inspired sequence.) Additionally, the spell point cost is reduced by 1 (minimum 0).</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc55\"><span><a href=\"/protection\">Protection</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Defended (imbue):</strong> The prodigy gains the benefit of one (aegis) talent she possesses and may use her class level in place of her caster level to determine its effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Adamantine Skin (finish):</strong> When taking damage, the prodigy may spend an immediate action to reduce the damage taken by her casting ability modifier times the length of her sequence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc56\"><span><a href=\"/telekinesis\">Telekinesis</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Air Step (imbue):</strong> The prodigy becomes immune to falling damage. If the prodigy is capable of using telekinesis on himself, whenever the prodigy adds a link to her sequence, she gains a fly speed as the Flight talent until the end of her next turn. Losing a link for any reason removes this fly speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Fling (finish):</strong> After dealing damage to or succeeding on a combat maneuver against a creature with an attack action, the prodigy may use the hostile lift function of the telekinesis ability on that creature as an immediate action. If successful, the prodigy may attempt to make a single attack using that creature as a bludgeon, moving it up to her telekinesis speed. The telekinesis ends after a number of rounds equal to half the length of the sequence (minimum 1 round). A creature is allowed to make Will saves to end the effect early as normal. The sequence must be at least one link long per size category of the target above Diminutive (1 link = Tiny, 2 links = Small, 3 links = Medium, etc.).</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc57\"><span><a href=\"/time\">Time</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Time Slip (imbue):</strong> The prodigy&#8217;s personal time speeds up, allowing her to easily sidestep attacks. The prodigy gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 competence bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by +1 per 6 class levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeless Duel (finish):</strong> If the prodigy has a sequence of at least three links, she may target a hostile creature within close range that she has dealt damage to or that has failed a save against a sphere effect cast as part of her active sequence as a swift action. All other creatures and objects are momentarily frozen in time. The prodigy and the targeted creature gain a number of rounds equal to the length of the sequence divided by 3. A successful Will save negates this effect, preventing either creature from gaining any rounds. During this time, they cannot affect any creature or object not subject to this effect, but may affect themselves and each other. Non-instantaneous effects cast during this time end when this effect ends. Creatures and attended objects other than the prodigy and the targeted creature may not in any way be affected by any actions taken during this apparent time. The prodigy cannot activate this finish while affected by another instance of it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc58\"><span><a href=\"/war\">War</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Inspiring (imbue):</strong> All allies within close range gain the benefits of the prodigy&#8217;s inspired sequence ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Motivate Cohort (finish):</strong> As a move action, the prodigy may grant a number of allies within close range equal to half the length of her sequence the ability to immediately make a bonus attack at their highest base attack bonus. If not used immediately, this bonus attack is lost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc59\"><span><a href=\"/warp\">Warp</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Step Between (imbue) (requires teleport):</strong> Once per turn, as a move action the prodigy can choose to teleport up to 5ft. + 5 ft. per link in her current sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Warping Presence (imbue) (requires bend space):</strong> The prodigy warps space around himself in a radius equal to 5 ft. per link in her active sequence. The first time each turn a hostile creature attempts to move into a square inside this radius, the creature must make a Will save or treat all squares within the effect as difficult terrain until the start of their next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Private Battlefield (finish) (requires bend space):</strong> If the prodigy has a sequence of at least three links, she may target a hostile creature within close range that she has dealt damage to or that has failed a save against a sphere effect cast as part of her active sequence as a swift action. The prodigy and the targeted creature are shunted to a private, empty demiplane of normal characteristics (air, normal gravity, normal magic, normal time, and no alignment or magic traits) for a number of rounds equal to the length of the sequence divided by 3. This plane is featureless and loops in on itself, having a radius equal to the prodigy&#8217;s close range and cosmetic features of the prodigy&#8217;s choosing. The prodigy and the target appear a distance apart equal to their distance when this ability is activated. A successful Will save negates this effect. The prodigy cannot activate this finish while affected by another instance of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sudden Shuffle (finish) (requires teleport):</strong> As a move action, the prodigy may target a number of willing creatures equal to the length of her sequence, freely swapping their places. Each target must end in a square that was previously occupied by one other target. All creatures must be within the prodigy&#8217;s teleport range.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc60\"><span><a href=\"/weather\">Weather</a></span></h3>\n<p><strong>Ignore Tempest (imbue):</strong> The prodigy may treat each weather category as 1 step lower, plus an additional step per 7 class levels, to a minimum category of 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Call Bolts (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may call down one bolt of lightning per link, each targeting a creature or square within control weather range. No creature or square may be targeted by more than one bolt. Each bolt does 1d6 electricity damage per class level. A successful Reflex save negates this damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Pressure Front (finish):</strong> As a standard action, the prodigy may make a bullrush attempt against all creatures in a line 10 ft. per link long and 5 ft. per link wide. The prodigy uses her caster level plus her casting ability modifier in place of her base attack bonus plus her Strength modifier for making this check.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc61\"><span><a href=\"/wild-magic\">Wild Magic</a></span></h3>\n<p>A prodigy that possesses the <a href=\"/casting-traditions\">wild magic drawback</a>, any <a href=\"/wild-magic-feats\">wild magic feat</a>, or another ability that imposes a wild magic chance on her casting abilities may select wild magic instead of a magic sphere when activating her imbue sequence ability. Doing so grants the following abilities:</p>\n<p><strong>Chaos Aura (imbue):</strong> Hostile creatures within 20 ft. of the prodigy increase their wild magic chance by 10% per link in her active sequence.</p>\n<p><strong>Swallow Surge (finish):</strong> As part of casting a sphere ability, the prodigy may end her current sequence to reduce her wild magic chance by 20% per link.</p>\n",
