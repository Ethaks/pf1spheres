      "value": "<p>A warden of spirit is a fierce individual of passion and heart, typically with an incredible connection to nature itself. These wardens command the essence of nature around them, calling brilliant flame and chilling currents to their allies&#8217; aid.</p>\n<p><strong>Vigil Sphere:</strong> Nature</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Guard:</strong> A spiritual warden&#8217;s guard is made up of spirits of nature, wood and leaves. At 3rd level, the warden&#8217;s guarded allies gain a bonus to their CMD equal to the warden&#8217;s guard bonus. Additionally, whenever the warden would use one of his (spirit) Nature abilities, he may instead grant one of his guarded allies the benefits of the (spirit) talent, instead of himself.</p>\n<p><strong>Spiritual Invigoration:</strong> At 7th level, the warden and allies (guarded or not) adjacent to him can use a swift action to grant themselves a number of temporary hit points equal to half the warden&#8217;s level (minimum 1). These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If the warden has a patrol active when an ally uses this ability, or the ally is his guarded ally, they instead gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1/2 his class level plus his casting ability modifier (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Primal Bulwark:</strong> At 11th level, when using his guard ability, the warden may spend a spell point to grant an additional effect depending on the Nature packages he possesses. If the warden possesses multiple Nature packages, he may only choose a single package as part of using this ability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air:</strong> The target gains a fly speed (average) equal to the guarded allies&#8217; base land speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Earth:</strong> The target gains light fortification (25% chance to negate a critical hit or precision damage).</li>\n<li><strong>Fire:</strong> Whenever the target would suffer damage from a melee attack, the attacker must succeed a Reflex save or suffer an amount of fire damage equal to the maximum fire size the warden can affect.</li>\n<li><strong>Metal:</strong> Whenever the target would be dealt bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, they may use an immediate action or expend an attack of opportunity to reduce the damage dealt by an amount equal to the warden&#8217;s level.</li>\n<li><strong>Plant:</strong> Whenever the target would be attacked by a manufactured melee weapon, they may use an immediate action to make a free disarm attempt against the attacker, with the CMB for this check being equal to the warden&#8217;s class level + his casting ability modifier.</li>\n<li><strong>Water:</strong> The target gains a swim speed equal to their base land speed. Additionally, whenever they would be dealt fire or acid damage, they may use an immediate action or expend an attack of opportunity to reduce the damage dealt by 2d6 + the warden&#8217;s casting ability modifier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sentinel of the Ancients:</strong> At 15th level, whenever the warden would use his patrol ability, he may spend a spell point to infuse his area of patrol with ancient spirits of nature. All allies within the warden&#8217;s area of patrol gain a specific benefit depending on the Nature packages he possesses. If the warden possesses or is counted as possessing multiple Nature packages, he must choose a single package as part of using this ability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air:</strong> Affected allies gain a +4 bonus to AC against ranged attacks, and a +10 foot enhancement bonus to all movement speeds they possess.</li>\n<li><strong>Earth:</strong> Affected allies gain a +2 bonus to CMD against trip and bull rush attempts, and gain acid resistance 5. This resistance stacks with similar sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Fire:</strong> Affected allies reduce all bleed damage suffered by 2, and gain fire resistance 5. This resistance stacks with similar sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Metal:</strong> Affected allies gain DR 5/adamantine. This DR stacks with similar sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Plant:</strong> Affected allies gain a +2 natural armor bonus to AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Water:</strong> Affected allies gain a +4 bonus to CMB checks made to break a grapple, and gains cold resistance 5. This resistance stacks with similar sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This lasts until the end of his next turn. If the warden would reactivate his patrol before the end of his next turn, he can keep extending the duration of the ability by one additional round without spending a spell point. He may choose a different package to use when reactivating his patrol.</p>\n<p><strong>Guardian of Nature:</strong> At 19th level, the warden can call forth a guardian of nature. This functions as the Zoetic Geomancy advanced nature talent, except he can spend 10 additional minutes and 1 additional spell point to apply the advanced template to the summoned creature. This guardian of nature lasts for 1 minute per warden level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc77\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Vigil Reinforcements</span></span></h3>\n<h4 id=\"toc78\"><span>Improved Primal Bulwark (requires spirit, warden 14)</span></h4>\n<p>Whenever the warden would use his primal bulwark vigil ability, he may spend an additional spell point to enhance his primal bulwark, granting greater effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air:</strong> The granted fly speed is doubled, and becomes (perfect) maneuverability.</li>\n<li><strong>Earth:</strong> The granted fortification increases to medium fortification (50% chance to negate a critical hit or precision damage)</li>\n<li><strong>Fire:</strong> The granted fire resistance increases to fire resistance 15.</li>\n<li><strong>Metal:</strong> The target also gains DR/adamantine equal to the warden&#8217;s casting ability modifier (minimum 1).</li>\n<li><strong>Plant:</strong> Whenever the target would be attacked, they may use an immediate action to make a free grapple attempt against the attacker, with the CMB for this check being equal to the warden&#8217;s class level + his casting ability modifier.</li>\n<li><strong>Water:</strong> The granted cold resistance increases to cold resistance 15.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"toc79\"><span>Rooted Guard (requires spirit)</span></h4>\n<p>The warden&#8217;s guarded allies double the bonus to their CMD granted by guard against bull rush, overrun, reposition, and trip attempts.</p>\n",
