      "value": "<p>The scholar learns how to cultivate and distill the cordyceps-family of fungus, that have been studied to override the nervous systems of living or dead creatures to create a zombie-like state.</p>\n<p>The scholar may cultivate cordyceps spores during an 8 hour rest, keeping them in a small container, such as a bottle or potion vial. The scholar may activate this imposition by spreading these spores onto a corpse within her natural reach, raising it as a yellow musk zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary pg. 285), a special zombie that is treated as a plant and gains plant immunities instead of being undead. The corpse must have a number of Hit Dice less than or equal to her scholar level or this imposition has no effect. The yellow musk zombie understands and follows the scholar&#8217;s commands to the best of its ability.</p>\n<p>If the yellow musk zombie moves more than 100 feet away from the scholar, the spores disperse 1d4 rounds later and the yellow musk zombie is destroyed, regardless of whether or not it returns to the scholar&#8217;s side during that time. The scholar may not have more than one yellow musk zombie active with this ability at a time. As long as the yellow musk zombie is not destroyed, the spores can be reclaimed into its vial by touching the yellow musk zombie as a swift action. This destroys the yellow musk zombie and returns the corpse to normal. The cordycep spores can only be used for 10 minutes per scholar level each day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 10-minute increments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spore Threads [explosive]:</strong> The scholar may enhance her flashbangs with strengthened cordycep cultures, causing targets who fail their save to be entangled for 1d6 rounds, in addition to the normal effects. A target may escape this entangle by attempting a Strength check or Escape Artist check with a DC equal to the scholar&#8217;s flashbang DC or by taking a number of points of fire damage equal to the scholar&#8217;s class level. Each round the target is entangled by this effect, the target is confused. The confusion is a mind-affecting poison effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong>* If a <a href=\"/stitcher\">stitcher</a> gains this material imposition, they may treat the yellow musk zombie as an undead raised by her reanimate sphere effect for the purposes of talents and effects. The yellow musk zombie does not count against the stitcher&#8217;s maximum number of undead she may have reanimated at a time.</p>\n",
