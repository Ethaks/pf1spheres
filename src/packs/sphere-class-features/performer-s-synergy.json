      "value": "<p>A troubadour has played so many parts in his life that he can pull expertise from them at a moment&#8217;s notice to give himself insight and resilience of mind and heart. Whenever the troubadour is in his base persona, he gains a +1 morale bonus to all saving throws. This bonus increase by 1 at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<p>At 10th level, the troubadour&#8217;s ability to perform a variety of parts means he no longer needs to prepare a persona to access a trope&#8217;s benefit. As a move action, the troubadour can grant his base persona one trope of his choice, so long as he has at least one persona with that trope. He does not, however, gain any persona quirks. The troubadour retains this trope indefinitely, until he spends another move action to choose a different trope benefit to gain, which then replaces the first. Abilities with a limited number of uses (such as the lover or cunning servant trope powers) share their uses between the base persona and any other personas that possess them.</p>\n<p>At 20th level, the troubadour can grant his base persona two trope benefits as a move action, rather than only one.</p>\n",
