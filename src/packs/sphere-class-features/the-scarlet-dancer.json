      "value": "<p><strong>Initiation:</strong> The scarlet dancer increases the amount of bleed damage she deals when applying bloodletting to her Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding:</strong> When the scarlet dancer causes an enemy to become exsanguinated, she may spend 2 points of vitae as a free action to make an attack against an enemy within reach that is not exsanguinated.</p>\n<p><strong>Revelation:</strong> A crimson dancer who knows their limits can maintain a calm, stable attitude even in the face of death, and instead embrace a delicate and graceful form of combat. Once per turn, when the scarlet dancer causes a nonbleeding creature to begin bleeding with a melee weapon due to her bloodletting feature, or would inflict her bloodletting on an exsanguinated creature with a melee weapon, she may move up to 10 feet as a free action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from bleeding creatures, and she may move through squares occupied by a creature bleeding from her bloodletting feature without an Acrobatics check.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret of Blood:</strong> The scarlet dancer flourishes upon the velvet floor. Once per round, while adjacent to a bleeding creature, the scarlet dancer may spend 1 vitae as a swift action to move into an unoccupied square that is adjacent to a creature that is not exsanguinated within close range (25 + 5 per 2 crimson dancer levels) and within her line of sight. This movement is considered to be a supernatural teleportation effect.</p>\n<p>If the scarlet dancer possesses the Blood Fountain (bleed) talent, the crimson dancer may use this ability while adjacent to, or standing on, a square filled with bloody terrain.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret of Heart:</strong> The scarlet dancer always moves gracefully, and never ceases to stop her dance. The scarlet dancer&#8217;s base speeds can never be reduced by an effect (including wearing heavy armor or encumbrance). She may also spend 4 vitae points as an immediate action to ignore any effect or condition that would impede her movement for one round, as per the Freedom (word) talent of the Fate sphere. This is a supernatural effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret of Soul:</strong> The scarlet dancer&#8217;s soul becomes truly free, and capable of performing a sacred technique known as the sanguine dance. As a full-round action, the scarlet dancer immediately drains all of her stored vitae. For each 6 points of vitae drained, she can dash forward, moving in a single direction up to 60 feet (this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity), attacking each creature she passes through with her decimate special attack action (without needing to expend focus). Each dash must be performed sequentially, and a creature already struck by an attack cannot be attacked again.</p>\n<p>After performing the sanguine dance, the scarlet dancer cannot perform it again for 24 hours and she loses any remaining vitae she may have had. The scarlet dancer cannot use other abilities that allow her to move while performing the sanguine dance, she must finish all dashes sequentially without additional movement, and if she is subject to forced movement, she may not utilize any additional dashes she had remaining.</p>\n<p><strong>Realization:</strong> The scarlet dancer becomes unbound. She can move into a space occupied by a creature suffering from her bloodletting, or any adjacent spaces, without consuming movement, requiring an Acrobatics check, or provoking attacks of opportunities as part of any action made to move.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the scarlet dancer can treat any creature suffering from her bloodletting as if they were exsanguinated, if it would be beneficial to her.</p>\n",
