The trap&#8217;s previous owner is no longer able to pass through the trap&#8217;s space unharmed, although any creatures who knew where the trap was placed still gain the usual bonuses against activating the trap. Additionally, the technician may upgrade the trap if it is inferior to his own and it is a trap he is able to create, changing its variables such as damage, and saving throws, to become as if he had been the one to place the trap.</li>\n<li><strong>Magical Trap:</strong> When disarming a magic trap that allows specific creatures to pass without danger and beating the trap&#8217;s DC by 10 or more, the technician can modify which creatures are allowed to pass, such as adding his allies or restricting his enemies if he desires.</li>\n</ul>\n",
