      "value": "<p><strong>Broken Creativity (Ex):</strong> At 3rd level, a conscript can deal either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage with an improvised weapon, and while drunk a conscript deals additional damage with an improvised weapon equal to 1/3 his base attack bonus (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Lasting Drunkenness (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever a conscript expends his drunk status, he is still treated as though he had the drunk status for the purpose of talents which would grant him benefits for having it for 1 minute. In addition, he gains a +2 dodge bonus to his armor class and a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws while drunk. At 16th level, these bonuses increase by +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Eternal Drunk (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the conscript is always treated as though he had the &#8216;drunk&#8217; status for the purpose of talents which would grant benefits for having it, and all improvised weapons he wields are always treated as 2 size categories larger than they actually are for the purpose of determining how much damage they deal.</p>\n",
