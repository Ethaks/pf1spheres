      "value": "<p>The armiger gains the Leadership sphere as a bonus talent. If the armiger already possesses this sphere, she instead gains a Leadership talent of her choice</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc33\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Focusing Switch (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, while using her active weapon, whenever the armiger succeeds on a combat maneuver, confirms a critical hit, or reduces a foe to 0 or fewer hit points, she may regain martial focus by activating a different customized weapon as an immediate action, stowing the current weapon and drawing the new one as needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc34\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Rapid Assault (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 5th level, the armiger becomes an expert at rapidly integrating multiple weapons into her attack routines. Whenever the armiger successfully damages a creature or succeeds on a combat maneuver while using the attack action with a customized weapon, she may expend martial focus as a swift action to make an additional attack against that creature at her highest base attack bonus. This attack takes a -2 penalty on the attack roll and can only be taken with a customized weapon other than the one used in the triggering attack. At 10th level and every five levels thereafter, the armiger may make an additional attack, as long as each previous attack was successful, using a different customized weapon each time and increasing the attack penalty by 2 each time. The armiger cannot use the same weapon twice in the same attack sequence with this ability. The armiger may spend a move action to move up to her speed between the triggering action and her first additional attack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc35\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Enhanced Customization (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level, the armiger treats the enhancement bonus of her active weapon set as if it were 1 higher. This bonus increases by +1 every four levels thereafter, though it cannot cause the total enhancement of the weapon to exceed +5. This bonus applies even if the weapon is not masterwork or does not already have at least a +1 bonus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc36\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Lightning Change (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 7th level, once per round the armiger may stow her active weapon and draw and activate another customized weapon as a free action even when it is not her turn. This is in addition to the number of times per round the armiger may stow her weapons per round with quick change.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc37\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Lightning Assault (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 15th level, as a full-round action, the armiger may expend martial focus to make two attack actions. Each attack action must be made with a different customized weapon. This ability cannot be used to trigger her rapid assault ability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc38\"><span><span style=\"color: #993300\">Unlimited Assault (Ex)</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the armiger is no longer required to expend martial focus to activate her lightning assault ability and may trigger her rapid assault ability with the first of the granted attack actions to damage a creature.</p>\n",
