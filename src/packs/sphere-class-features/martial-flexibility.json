      "value": "<p>Starting at 2nd level, the conscript can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat he doesn&#8217;t possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The conscript must meet all the feat&#8217;s prerequisites. He may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 his conscript level (minimum 4 times per day).</p>\n<p>The conscript can use this ability again before the duration expires to replace the previous combat feat with another choice. If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as with Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat&#8217;s daily limit.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the conscript can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. He may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. He may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that he cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another&#8217;s prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward his daily uses of this ability.</p>\n<p>At 16th level, the conscript can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. He may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. He may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability. This counts as the brawler&#8217;s martial flexibility class feature; characters who gain martial flexibility from multiple sources add their class levels from all sources that grant martial flexibility together when determining their total class level and uses per day for this ability.</p>\n",
