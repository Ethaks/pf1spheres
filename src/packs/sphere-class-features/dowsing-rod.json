      "value": "<p>The scholar&#8217;s studies have taught her how to identify objects that serve as natural dowsing rods capable of leading her towards a person, place, or thing. The scholar must have seen the thing she seeks or an accurate representation of it (such as a detailed portrait) in order for this ability to work. If searching for a non-specific type of thing (such as the nearest body of water, the nearest city, etc.) the scholar need not have seen it or a representation before, but the rod becomes much less accurate, and may lead to something other than what she seeks (for example, a scholar seeking the nearest body of water could be led to a puddle or the ocean, and one seeking the nearest city could be led to a bustling metropolis or the ruins of an ancient civilization). Once activated, the dowsing rod will always point towards the desired target, though it gives no indication as to the target&#8217;s distance and always points directly towards it, regardless of obstacles. If the target is protected by a nondetection spell or similar effect, the scholar uses her class level as her caster level when determining if her dowsing rod can pierce the effect. This is a supernatural effect, except for when using it to locate the nearest body or source of water, in which case it can be used as an extraordinary ability.</p>\n",
