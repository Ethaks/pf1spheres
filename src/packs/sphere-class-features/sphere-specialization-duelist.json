      "value": "<p><strong>Death By A Thousand Cuts (Ex):</strong> Starting at 3rd level, a conscript&#8217;s attacks slowly sap away his foe&#8217;s strength. Whenever the conscript deals bleed damage to a creature, it must make a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the amount of bleed damage the target is suffering due to talents from the Duelist sphere (treat bleed damage in form of dice as their minimum roll)) or become fatigued; creatures who are already fatigued become exhausted, and exhausted creatures who fail their save lose consciousness and fall asleep.</p>\n<p>Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding (but not taking bleed damage) awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action). Creatures immune to bleed are immune to all other effects of this ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Blooded Riposte (Ex):</strong> From 8th level on, whenever a creature currently taking bleed damage successfully deals damage to a conscript with a melee attack, the conscript may make an attack action to disarm that creature as an immediate action.</p>\n<p><strong>Exsanguinating Strikes (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, the bleed damage granted by blooded strike increases to 1d6 + 1d6 per 3 points of base attack bonus he possesses. In addition, the conscript&#8217;s attacks now ignore immunity to bleed damage; even if the target is not a creature with blood or capable of bleeding, his penetrating blows still sap whatever force animates the target creature.</p>\n",
