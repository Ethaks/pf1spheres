      "value": "<p>The scholar learns how to combine a small sample of a chosen element with other materials to grow a living elemental that they can keep in a small container, such as a bottle or potion vial. When this imposition is chosen, the scholar selects one of the following: air, earth, fire, or water.</p>\n<p>The scholar may grow a small elemental of this type during an 8 hour rest; at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, the scholar increases the size and power of the elemental she can grow in this way by 1 step (medium, large, huge, greater). The scholar may activate this imposition to release the elemental from the vial, allowing it to aid her on and off the battlefield. The elemental understands the scholar and follows her commands to the best of its ability. If the elemental moves more than 100 ft. away from the scholar, it disperses 1d4 rounds later, regardless of whether or not it returns to the scholar&#8217;s side during that time. The scholar cannot have more than one elemental active with this ability at a time, and activating another imposition dismisses the elemental, causing it to return to its vial. As long as the elemental is not destroyed, banished, or dispersed, it can be reclaimed into its vial as a swift action. Elementals conjured in this way are treated as summoned creatures for spells and effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Elemental Enhancement [explosive]:</strong> As long as the scholar is adjacent to an active elemental from this imposition&#8217;s primary effect, she may use it to augment her flashbangs with elemental power, allowing them to deal damage of the type matching her elemental. Targets must make a Reflex save instead of the normal Fortitude save; in addition to the normal effects of the flashbang, the scholar deals an amount of additional damage of the chosen element type (air deals electricity damage, water deals cold damage, earth deals acid damage, and fire deals fire damage) equal to 1d6 per scholar level. Creatures who succeed on their Reflex save take 1/2 damage and are not subject to the flashbang&#8217;s normal effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> The scholar may choose this imposition more than once, selecting a different element each time.</p>\n",
