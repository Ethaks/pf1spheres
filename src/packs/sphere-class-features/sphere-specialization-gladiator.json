In addition, whenever he begins a performance combat, he starts with a number of victory points equal to half his practitioner modifier (rounded down, minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Gladiatorial Weapon Master (Ex):</strong> Once the conscript reaches 20th level, whenever he threatens a critical hit with a weapon with the performance special feature or any weapon from the Gladiator Training discipline, he automatically confirms the critical threat. In addition, he is always treated as having the Improved Critical feat for any of these weapons.</p>\n",
