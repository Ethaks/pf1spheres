      "value": "<p>Over the course of his career, the commander makes friends and earns favors with all manner of individuals whose careers intersect with the military and adventuring lifestyles. Once per week, as long as the commander is in a small town or larger center of civilization, the commander may call in such a favor to gain temporary access to specially trained mounts for himself and his allies. These mounts may be camels, hippogriffs, sharks, or any type of animal as appropriate to the local environments, but mounts gained through use of this ability never have more than 5 HD. The commander gains access to a number of mounts equal to his class level; these mounts are typically well-equipped to deal with local terrains, whether that entails swimming, flying, or another form of movement, and have a 60 ft. movement speed appropriate to any of their modes of movement; generally, mounts should not have more than two movement modes (such as a land and fly speed), and may only have one if appropriate, such as a shark only having a swim speed.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the exact type or nature of these mounts, they know that they are on loan and consider their own safety to be of utmost importance; if the party is attacked or otherwise comes under fire from an enemy source, the mounts will immediately deposit the commander and his allies in the nearest safest location before retreating to a safe distance until the danger ends. The mounts will also not allow themselves to be sold, and generally have prominent markings declaring their ownership, such as branding or dyeing in the design or colors of the rightful owner. In addition, the mounts will not follow the commander or his allies into obviously dangerous situations, including into dungeons, active volcanoes, extra-planar rifts, etc. The commander has access to these mounts for 1 week, plus 1 additional week at 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n",
