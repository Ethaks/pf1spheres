      "value": "<p>The sage may spend a ki point as a swift action to grant himself a fly speed of 30 ft. with average maneuverability for 1 minute per class level he possesses. For every 3 class levels the sage possesses beyond 5th, the flight speed increases by 10 ft. and the maneuverability increases by 1 step (to a maximum of perfect). If the sage is at least 10th level, this effect lasts for 1 hour per class level instead of 1 minute. The exact nature of this flight depends on which esoteric training package(s) the sage possesses; enhancers fly by leaping and kicking out with such force that they are launched through the air as they desire, chakra disruptors hurl themselves through the air on concussive pulses of ki, ki blasters ride on sustained bursts of energy, and infusers manipulate their ki in various ways to simulate flight, whether creating wings of pure ki, using ki to make their bodies lighter than air, or some similar technique. Regardless of the exact nature of their flight, only the outward appearance of the granted flight changes, all mechanical benefits are identical.</p>\n<p>A sage who possesses multiple esoteric training packages may choose to manifest his flight in a way consistent with any package he possesses. Creatures who see the sage in flight may make a DC 20 Knowledge (arcana) check to identify what esoteric training package the flight mode represents and what the base ability of that package is.</p>\n<p>The sage must be at least 5th level to take this esotery.</p>\n",
