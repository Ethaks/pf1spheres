      "value": "<p>By studying ancient magic and crafting techniques, the armiger learns to customize his arsenal in more fantastic and unusual ways. The armiger gains the ability to apply modifications to his customized weapons. Applying a modification can be done in the same time it takes the armiger to customize a weapon, and each customized weapon can only have one modification applied to it at any given time. The armiger can apply any modification he meets the minimum level for. A modification applied to a custom weapon with the double weapon quality applies to both ends. The armiger must have the customized weapons class feature to gain this prowess.</p>\n<p>The armiger can select from the following initial modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexible Materials:</strong> The customized weapon gains the trip weapon special feature and grants a +2 circumstance bonus on disarm combat maneuvers made using the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Grapnel Attachment:</strong> The armiger customizes his weapon to fire a built-in grappling hook. The grappling hook is attached to a 30-foot-long chain. The armiger can attack with the grappling hook as a special attack action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. On a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but functions as though it had the grapple weapon special feature, except it requires only a hit (not a critical hit). The grapple ends if the armiger moves more than 30 feet away from the grappled creature. The customized weapon cannot be used to make attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (as a standard action). The length of the chain increases by 5 feet at level 5, and every 5 thereafter, and the armiger increases the maximum distance he can stand from the grappled target by the same amount.</li>\n<li><strong>Lethality Repurposing:</strong> The customized weapon can be used to deal lethal or nonlethal damage without taking a penalty on your attack roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Odd Curves and Edges:</strong> Choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The customized weapon deals the chosen damage type in addition to any damage types it normally deals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 6th level, the armiger gains access to the following modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamic:</strong> The customized weapon may be thrown easily despite its shape. The customized weapon gains a range increment of 10 feet and can be thrown up to 5 range increments. If the customized weapon already has a range increment, instead increase the weapon&#8217;s range increment by 10 feet instead. This modification can only be applied to melee weapons.</li>\n<li><strong>Extending Framework:</strong> The customized weapon can extend or retract to be wielded at ranges normal weapons couldn&#8217;t. As a swift action, the armiger can extend or retract the customized weapon. When a customized weapon is extended, it gains the reach quality. When a customized weapon is retracted, it loses the reach quality. For example, an armiger adds the extending framework modification to a customized weapon lance, which allows him to retract his lance and remove the reach quality, and can then extend the customized weapon lance to restore the reach quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Shielding:</strong> You treat the customized weapon as a buckler, gaining a +1 shield bonus to AC as normal for a buckler. You lose this bonus (and stop treating the customized weapon as a buckler until the start of your next turn) if you attack with the weapon or wield another weapon in the same hand, unless you possess an ability to retain your shield bonus when making a shield bash attack, such as the Shield sphere Bashing Shield talent or the Improved Shield Bash feat. Making an attack with this weapon may count as making a shield bash if beneficial. When making a shield bash with the customized weapon, reduce the damage as if the shield bash was one size smaller.</li>\n<li><strong>Weightless:</strong> The customized weapon is unusually light, and can be wielded with greater precision than normal. The weapon is treated as a light melee weapon when determining whether it can be used with Weapon Finesse, as well as with any feat, spell, or special weapon ability that can be used in conjunction with light weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 12th level, the armiger gains access to the following modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dense Weighting:</strong> The customized weapon is treated as an appropriate weapon for sundering any type of object. Whenever a creature is hit by a customized weapon with this modification, they take a -2 penalty to their CMD against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers until the end of its next turn or until after the creature is subject to a maneuver (whichever comes first). This penalty does not stack with itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquimetal Blanch:</strong> The customized weapon&#8217;s surface shimmers and shifts, almost like liquid. Each round, the first time the customized weapon would deal damage to a creature that has material- based damage reduction, the customized weapon bypasses that damage-reduction as if made from that material until the beginning of your next turn. For example, the armiger strikes a creature with DR/silver with his customized weapon longsword with this modification. The weapon immediately hardens to be treated as silver until the end of the round. If the armiger would make an attack of opportunity against a creature with DR/cold iron during that same round, the customized weapon would not change to cold iron. This does not affect the weapon&#8217;s normal ability to bypass material-based damage reduction. A cold iron longsword with this modification will always bypass cold iron.</li>\n<li><strong>Parrying Edge:</strong> The customized weapon is easier for the armiger to block attacks with. When you fight defensively or use Combat Expertise while wielding the customized weapon, your AC bonus increases by 1. In addition, attacks of opportunity made with the customized weapon deal an additional amount of damage equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1). This additional damage is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit. An enemy can only take precision damage from this modification once each round.</li>\n</ul>\n",
