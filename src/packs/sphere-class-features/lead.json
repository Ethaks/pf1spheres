      "value": "<p>Lead is a metal particularly problematic for practitioners of divination magic, foiling the magical emanations they rely upon. When the scholar first gains this imposition she learns how to craft a thin helmet liner that must use at least 10 sp worth of lead and costs 1 hour and a total of 100 gp times the scholar&#8217;s class level to create. A lead helmet liner crafted in this manner may be sold for 1/2 its crafting cost, as long as it is currently functioning.</p>\n<p>As long as the scholar or an ally is wearing this helmet liner, any effect of the Divination school or the Divination sphere that targets or would reveal information about them requires the caster to make a caster level check (if using traditional casting) or an MSB check (if using Spheres of Power) against a DC of 11 + the scholar&#8217;s class level or have the effect fail. These liners do not occupy an item slot, but wearing more than one has no additional effect. Because they are not true magic items but rather science and geometry applied in a way that interferes with divination magic, these liners are somewhat fragile, and they cease to function after they have forced casters to attempt a caster level check or MSB check a number of times equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), as determined at the time the liner was crafted. Once this limit has been reached, the liner ceases to function until the scholar spends at least 1 hour re-attuning it. As an immediate action, the scholar may expend their martial focus to quickly adjust the liner, causing a caster level or MSB check to not consume one of its uses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Erratic Detonations [explosive]:</strong> The scholar adds a mixture of lead, silver, salt, and other materials which naturally disrupt magical energies to her flashbangs. The flashbang creates a cloud of fine dust with a radius of 5 ft. plus 5 ft. per 5 class levels that persists a number of rounds equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier. Creatures within this cloud suffer a 50% increase to wild magic chance. This cloud does not obscure vision. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 1 round. Any creature that leaves an affected square suffers a wild magic increase equal to half this amount until they spend a standard action or two move actions brushing the clinging dust off. If the scholar also possesses the circle of salt or silver material impositions, this wild magic chance increases by 25%, or by 50% if both are possessed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sup><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"/wild-magic\">Wild Magic</a></sup></p>\n",
