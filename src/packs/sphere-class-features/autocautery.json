      "value": "<p>At 1st level, the crimson dancer's body is conditioned against the manipulation or shedding of blood; rarely bleeding, even when severely wounded. As long as the crimson dancer has at least 1 vitae, whenever she would suffer hit point damage due to a bleed of any type, she reduces the damage it would deal to 0 and instead loses one point of vitae.</p>\n<p>If the crimson dancer would ever suffer blood loss (willing or not) due to a (blood art) talent, she may spend any amount of vitae as an immediate action (or as a free action that can be taken outside of her turn if she was willing) to reduce the damage from the blood loss by 3 per point of vitae spent. She is still considered to have taken the full amount of blood loss for any effects that rely on the amount of blood loss she takes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the crimson dancer gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks made against effects produced by the Blood or Duelist sphere. This bonus also applies to the crimson dancer&#8217;s CMD whenever she would be subject to a Blood or Duelist sphere effect. Autocautery&#8217;s bonus increases by +1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<p>At 14th level, crimson&#8217;s dancer vitae storage eventually becomes such an integral part of her body that her mortal heart barely functions. The crimson dancer becomes immune to all poisons, diseases and bleed effects, as well as any sphere effect that originates from the Blood sphere that is otherwise subject to spell resistance. Creatures that can bypass immunity to bleed effects also bypass the crimson dancer&#8217;s immunity to sphere effects from the Blood sphere. The crimson dancer may suppress these immunities if she so desires when targeted by an effect she would be immune to, although she cannot then later choose to become immune to that effect while it is ongoing.</p>\n<p>This is a supernatural effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> With the GM&#8217;s permission, the bonuses granted from this ability may also apply against non-Duelist sphere or Blood sphere effects that also pertain to blood, bleed effects or other things of a similar nature.</p>\n",
