      "value": "<p>The technician&#8217;s plans and creations are often halfbaked and highly improvised, yet somehow always seem to work out.</p>\n<p>The technician gains a pool of luck equal to 1 + his Charisma modifier (minimum: 1). This pool replenishes after roughly 8 hours of rest. Throughout the day, he may spend luck points to accomplish any of the following feats.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Uncanny Disarm (Ex):</strong> As a standard action, the technician may spend a luck point and throw an object or fire a ranged weapon at a trap or object within 30 ft. to attempt a Disable Device check to disable or sabotage it. This could include disarming a trap, jamming a door, causing a chandelier to fall immediately or fall in 1 round, or cause a mechanical object such as a siege engine or a crossbow or firearm to gain the broken condition. If the object to be affected is being carried by a creature, he must succeed at a ranged touch attack against the target first. He suffers a -5 penalty to his Disable Device check when making an Uncanny Disarm.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick Fix (Ex):</strong> The technician may spend 1 luck point as a move action to remove the broken condition from an object for 1 minute.</li>\n</ul>\n",
