      "value": "<p>Some crystals are believed to assist with clarity, memory, and mental focus. The scholar learns to create small amulets or charms incorporating such crystals using crystals or precious gemstones, costing 8 hours and 100 gp times the scholar&#8217;s class level to create. A crystalline focus may be sold for 1/2 its crafting cost, as long as it is currently functioning. As long as the scholar or an ally is wearing this amulet, they gain an insight bonus to concentration checks and Sense Motive checks equal to 1/2 the scholar&#8217;s class level (minimum 1), as determined at the time the amulet or charm was created. The scholar may rework a crystalline focus after leveling up to increase its bonus based on her current class level by paying the difference between its original crafting cost and the cost of creating one based on her current level. These charms do not occupy an item slot, but wearing more than one has no additional effect.</p>\n<p>The exact cleanliness, positioning, and presentation of the crystals to receive these benefits is very important, and extremely distressing events that would jostle or damage the charm, such as the wearer failing a Reflex saving throw or suffering a critical hit, have a 50% chance of throwing the charm out of alignment, breaking it and ending its benefits until the scholar spends at least 1 hour re-attuning it. A scholar who would lose a crystalline focus she is wearing in such a manner may expend her martial focus as an immediate action to prevent the charm from breaking. The scholar may create a purposely weaker foci, in which case the cost and bonuses are both reduced.</p>\n",
