      "value": "<p>At 10th level, the soul weaver may use lesion to take control of a target instead of damaging it. The blight spreads to their brain (Fortitude negates), giving them 4 points of ability drain to all mental ability scores and giving the soul weaver control over them for 1 hour per level or until the blight is cured. For the duration of this effect, the target can make only a standard action or move action on their turn, but not both.</p>\n<p>The target obeys all verbal commands (without a shared language, only basic commands such as come, fight, or stand still may be communicated) and does anything asked to the best of its ability, including self-destructive commands (a target command to hurt or kill itself deals its weapon damage + its Strength damage to itself per round until dead). Effects such as protection from evil or the Hallow word from the Fate sphere do not end this effect, since it is the result of a physical malady rather than a mind-altering or possession effect.</p>\n<p>Unlike the standard lesion ability, mind blight does not consume the target&#8217;s blight when used, and the target may be subject to another lesion or mind blight, even while already under the effects of a mind blight. If another soul weaver attempts to use mind blight on a target already under the effects of mind blight, the two soul weavers make opposed checks (d20 + their soul weaver level + their casting ability modifier) to determine who wins control of the target. Drain from multiple mind blights are cumulative.</p>\n",
