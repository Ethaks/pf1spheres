At 9th level and again at 15th level, he may move himself and that creature an additional 5 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Bear Hug (Ex):</strong> At 8th level, whenever the conscript makes a successful grapple check to maintain a grapple, that creature must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 conscript level + conscript&#8217;s Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or become fatigued for 1 round and lose their martial focus if they possess it. At 15th level, they are instead exhausted for 1 round.</p>\n<p><strong>Fatal Clutch (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, whenever the conscript maintains a grapple against a creature, the grappled creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 conscript level + conscript&#8217;s Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or take damage equal to 1/4 of their maximum hit points (rounded down).</p>\n",
