      "value": "<p>The sage gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he would not normally qualify for it. The sage treats his class level as monk levels when determining all effects of this feat, including uses per day. In addition to his unarmed strikes, the sage may declare a Stunning Fist attempt whenever he attacks with the melee touch attack granted by his chi gong class feature.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc77\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Skill Focus</span></span></h2>\n<p>The sage&#8217;s specialized training gives him keen insight into a variety of different subjects. At 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, the sage gains Skill Focus for a skill of his choice as a bonus feat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc78\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Signature Technique (Su)</span></span></h2>\n<p>At 20th level the sage gains a powerful esotery from the following list that acts as his signature technique. The sage cannot select a signature technique unless he possesses the corresponding esoteric training package. Signature techniques follow all other rules for esoteries, including determining saving throw DCs and the number of ki points that can be spent when activating them.</p>\n",
