      "value": "<p>The armorist adds cyclonic (+2) and seeking (+1) to the list of special abilities she can add to bound and summoned weapons. The armorist does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making a ranged attack with a weapon with either the cyclonic or seeking special abilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc55\"><span>Armor Training (Ex)</span></h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, an armorist learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, she reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (minimum 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th) these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum &#8211;5 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +5 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.</p>\n<p>In addition, an armorist can also move at her normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 7th level, an armorist can move at her normal speed while wearing heavy armor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc56\"><span>Boost Equipment</span></h2>\n<p>Beginning at 10th level, instead of summoning equipment, the armorist may touch a piece of magical equipment and spend a spell point to increase its enhancement bonus by half the bonus she may grant to summoned equipment (minimum +1). This has the same duration as summoned equipment and causes the item to count as summoned equipment for the purpose of arsenal tricks. This requires a standard action to boost equipment being wielded by another, but can be done with the same action cost as summoning equipment if the armorist is already touching or wielding the piece of equipment. The armorist must be able to summon a type of equipment (weapons, shields, or armor) in order to boost a piece of similar equipment.</p>\n<p>Just as with summoned equipment, a boost cannot raise a piece of equipment&#8217;s enhancement bonus higher than +5, but can be traded for special abilities. Boosting an item a second time replaces the first boosting, and pieces of bound equipment cannot be boosted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc57\"><span>Quick Summons</span></h2>\n<p>At 15th level, the armorist may summon or switch equipment onto herself as an immediate action or free action.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc58\"><span>Infinite Arsenal (Su)</span></h2>\n<p>At level 20, the armorist no longer needs to spend a spell point to summon equipment, and the duration of summoned equipment and boosted equipment increases to 1 hour per class level.</p>\n",
