      "value": "<p>Thaumaturges use bargains, secrets, and dangerous magical practices to push their casting to greater heights than their more careful contemporaries achieve. A thaumaturge may, as part of the action required to use a spell or sphere effect, increase his caster level by 2 for that effect.</p>\n<p>This applies to variables dependent on a particular casting of an effect (damage, duration, number of targets etc.), but it does not apply to the caster&#8217;s total caster level with that sphere (i.e., it does not determine the strength of a companion from the Conjuration sphere, nor to the total number of Hit Dice of reanimated creatures that may be controlled through the Death sphere). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level, and by an additional +1 for every 4 levels thereafter to a maximum of +6 at 17th level.</p>\n<p>Whenever a thaumaturge uses forbidden lore to enhance their magic, there is a 15% chance the thaumaturge will suffer backlash; the spell or sphere effect does not manifest, and any spell slot or spell points spent are lost. In addition, the thaumaturge suffers a -1 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and to their effective caster level (minimum 1), which lasts until he rests to regain spell points. This penalty is cumulative; every time the thaumaturge suffers backlash in a day, these penalties increase by 1.</p>\n",
