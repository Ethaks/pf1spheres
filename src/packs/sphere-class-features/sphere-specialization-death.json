      "value": "<p><strong>Power over Undead (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter receives Command Undead or Turn Undead as a bonus feat. He can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + his casting ability modifier, but only to use the selected feat. He can take other feats to add to this ability, such as Extra Channel and Improved Channel, but not feats that alter this ability, such as Elemental Channel and Alignment Channel. The DC to save against these feats is equal to 10 + 1/2 his incanter level + his casting ability modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Bolster (Sp):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter can touch an undead creature as a standard action and infuse it with negative energy. It gains a +2 profane bonus on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, as well as 2 temporary hit point per Hit Die and a +4 bonus to its channel resistance. These bonuses last for a number of rounds equal to the incanter&#8217;s casting ability modifier (minimum 1). The bonuses and temporary hit points are immediately dispelled if the creature is within the area of a consecrate spell or a Hallowed Totem. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his casting ability modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Touch (Sp):</strong> At 20th level, the incanter can touch incorporeal creatures as if his body, natural weapons, and wielded weapons were all under the effects of the ghost touch weapon special ability. He may activate or suppress this ability as a free action, and while this ability is active, he is immune to the touch attacks of shadows, ghosts, and other incorporeal creatures.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc27\"><span>Death Sub-Specialization: Guide of the Dead [Gravecaller's HB]</span></h4>\n<p>The following abilities replace power over undead, bolster, and spirit touch.</p>\n<p><strong>House Soul (Su):</strong> At 3rd level, the incanter gains the ability to house an unbodied soul within a corpse. With a special ritual requiring 8 hours, the incanter can raise a single skeleton or zombie as a housed soul. This functions as the Death sphere reanimate sphere effect and an undead raised this way benefits from the incanter&#8217;s Death sphere talents which benefit undead he creates. The incanter can only have one housed soul raised at any time and can dismiss the housed soul as a standard action, releasing the soul and destroying the undead.</p>\n<p>The housed soul does not count against the number of Hit Dice of undead the incanter can control with the Death sphere, and is a permanent undead. The housed soul automatically follows the incanter&#8217;s commands and does not need to be controlled by him. The housed soul gains all the regular benefits of the skeleton or zombie template with the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> The housed soul can speak and understand one language you know, chosen at the time it is raised.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit Dice</strong> The housed soul possesses a number Hit Dice equal to your incanter level, before any adjustments from the skeleton or zombie template, regardless of the corpse used to reanimate the housed soul.</li>\n<li><strong>Ability Scores</strong> The housed soul is never a mindless undead and possesses an Intelligence score equal to 6 + 1/2 your incanter level. This allows the housed soul to allocate skill ranks and gain feats appropriate to its current Hit Dice.</li>\n<li><strong>Weaknesses</strong> The housed soul is merely a guest in its corpse. Effects which would protect or grant immunity to possession, such as the Fate sphere Hallow (word), can expel the housed soul from its body, releasing the soul and destroying the undead. The caster of such an effect must succeed at a magic skill check against the incanter&#8217;s MSD or fail to expel the housed soul.</li>\n<li><strong>Of Pure Body</strong> While the housed soul counts as an undead raised by your Death sphere abilities for any talents you possess, it cannot be destroyed or sacrificed by the incanter&#8217;s effects (such as the Dark Sacrifice talent) or be the target of effects which would alter or merge corpses (such as the Death sphere Corpse Manipulation talent or Corpse Forge advanced talent).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Expedited Calling (Su):</strong> At 8th level, the incanter can raise a housed soul in 1 hour, instead of 8 hours, and may spend 1 spell point to raise a housed soul in 1 minute.</p>\n<p>In addition, if the incanter possesses the ability to apply a template to a skeleton or zombie raised with the Death sphere reanimate sphere effect, such as the templates available through the Expanded Necromancy talent or Strange Corpsecraft feat, the incanter may apply a single template to the housed soul.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Forms (Su):</strong> At 20th level, the incanter may raise a housed soul in a more powerful body. This functions as the Death sphere Greater Undead advanced talent, allowing the incanter to raise an undead with a challenge rating less than or equal to 1/2 his incanter level. An undead raised this way is still a housed soul for all other purposes. Add a number of racial Hit Dice to the housed soul until it has an amount equal to your incanter level, adjust its Intelligence score, and grant it the weakness to possession and of pure body qualities. If the undead is not mindless, the incanter may choose to grant the housed soul a bonus to its Intelligence score equal to 1/2 his incanter level instead of replacing its existing Intelligence score.</p>\n",
