      "value": "<p><strong>Perfect Ambidexterity (Ex):</strong> From 3rd level on, the conscript reduces all penalties taken for two-weapon fighting or attacking with a main hand and off-hand weapon using the Dual Wielding sphere by 1 (so a conscript wielding at least one light weapon will only take a -1 penalty for dual wielding, and a conscript wielding two one-handed weapons would take a -3 penalty for dual wielding). This reduction applies after any other effects that reduce the conscript&#8217;s dual wielding penalties, such as the Balanced Blows talent.</p>\n<p><strong>Rending Strikes:</strong> At 8th level, a conscript gains Two-Weapon Rend as a bonus feat, even if he would not normally qualify for it. Whenever the conscript rolls maximum damage on his rend damage dice (normally this means rolling a 10 on 1d10), the target of his attack is sickened for a number of rounds equal to his practitioner modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Eviscerate (Ex):</strong> At 20th level, a conscript becomes an expert at cutting his foes apart with his perfectly paired weapons; whenever the conscript deals damage with his main-hand weapon, his next attack with his off-hand weapon is automatically a critical threat as long as it successfully hits the target, regardless of the actual roll.</p>\n",
